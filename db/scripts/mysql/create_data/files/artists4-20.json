The song became a #1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 on April 5,1975, #2 in the UK, and #3 on the R&B charts in the US. The song is especially noteworthy due to the unusually high pitches that Riperton reaches during the song.\n\nSetting\n\nIt was the fourth single from the album Perfect Angel (1974). The song is notable for Riperton's use of the whistle register. While it is believed that \"Lovin' You\" was the first song to reach number one without the help of a percussion instrument, \"Yesterday\" by The Beatles accomplished this feat ten years earlier.\n\nAccording to the liner notes from Riperton's compilation CD Petals, the melody for \"Lovin' You\" was created as a distraction for her daughter (Maya Rudolph) when she was a baby so that Minnie and her husband Richard could hang out. Maya was in the studio with her mother on the day the song was recorded and Riperton can be heard singing her daughter's name at the end of the song.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Minnie+Riperton/_/Lovin%27+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Very few vocal artists in the industry have Ferrells potent combination of range, phrasing, and musicianship. Ferrell first emerged in the states with her R&B debut Rachelle Ferrell (1992), a solid collection of self-penned originals that featured a striking duet with Will Downing (Nothing Has Ever Felt Like This). It was with the release of First Instrument in 1994 (recorded prior to Rachelle Ferrell) that audiences were really introduced to Ferrells jazz sensibilities.Rachelle Ferrell began singing at the age of six, which many speculate contributed to the development of her startling six and change octave range. Her range also includes the ability to sing in the whistle register, as stated in an editorial review in which she references her highest notes in It only took a minute as Minnie Riperton-like wailing. She received classical training in violin at an early age and by the time she was a teen, she was able to play the piano at a professional level. She enrolled in Berklee College of Music in Boston where she honed her musical abilities in arrangement, singing and songwriting.From 1975-90, Ferrell sang backup for Lou Rawls, Patti LaBelle, Vanessa Williams, and George Duke. Ferrells debut, First Instrument, was released in 1990 in Japan, five years prior to its US release. Recorded with bassist Tyrone Brown, pianist Eddie Green and drummer Doug Nally, an all-star cast of accompanists also leave their mark on her record. They include trumpeter Terence Blanchard, pianists Gil Goldstein and Michel Petrucciani, bassists Kenny Davis and Stanley Clarke, tenor saxophonist Wayne Shorter and keyboardist Pete Levin. Her unique take on now-standards like Sam Cookes You Send Me, Cole Porters What Is This Thing Called Love, and Rodgers & Harts My Funny Valentine, captured the hearts and souls of the Japanese jazz buying public", "img": null, "title": "Rachelle Ferrell", "url": "http://sanfrancisco.eventful.com/events/rachelle-ferrell-/E0-001-110201954-8@2018033020?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Yoshi's - Jack London Square", "city": "Oakland"}], "description": "Minnie Riperton (Nov 8, 1947 - Jul 12, 1979) was an American singer who is best remembered for her 1974 hit ballad, Lovin' You.\n\nThe tragic 1979 death of 31-year-old Riperton silenced one of soul music's most unique and unforgettable voices - blessed with an angelic five-octave vocal range, she scored her greatest commercial success with the chart-topping pop ballad, \"Lovin' You\". Riperton was born in Chicago on November 8, 1947. As a young girl, she studied music, drama, and dance at the city's Lincoln Center and later contemplated a career in opera. Her pop career began in 1963 when she joined the local girl group called The Gems (not to be confused with the 60s New York-based girl group Gems, led by Louise Bethune), who were also known at times as The Starlets (1963-1966), signing to the famed Chess label to release a handful of singles as well as lend backing vocals to acts including Fontella Bass, The Dells, and Etta James. After graduating from high school, Riperton went to work at Chess as a receptionist. A year before The Gems' dissolution in 1967, she also signed with the label as a solo act, releasing a single, Lonely Girl, under the alias Andrea Davis (a pseudonym she used in honor of Billy Davis, her mentor at Chess who wrote the song for her).\n\nIn 1967, Riperton was installed as the lead vocalist of the psychedelic soul band Rotary Connection, which debuted that year with a self-titled LP on Cadet Concepts. The singles \"Amen\" and \"Lady Jane\" found a home on underground FM radio, but the group failed to make much of an impression on mainstream outlets. While still a Connection member, Riperton mounted a solo career. Teaming up with producer/arranger Charles Stepney and her husband/composer Richard Rudolph, she issued her brilliant 1970 debut, Come to My Garden, but again commercial success eluded her. After Rotary Connection dissolved in the wake of 1971's Hey Love, she and Rudolph took a two-year sabbatical in Florida before relocating to Los Angeles, where she sang on Stevie Wonder's Fulfillingness' First Finale and toured as a member of his backing unit Wonderlove.\n\nWonder agreed to co-produce Riperton's 1974 album Perfect Angel, which included the international blockbuster \"Lovin' You\". The record made her a household name, although subsequent LPs like 1975's Adventures in Paradise and 1977's Stay in Love failed to repeat its success. By this time, however, commercial woes were the least of Riperton's concerns - diagnosed with breast cancer, she underwent a mastectomy in 1976, later becoming a spokesperson for the American Cancer Society and earning a Society Courage Award from then-President Jimmy Carter. Riperton continued performing despite her declining condition, with 1979's Minnie, the final record completed during her lifetime - but died in Los Angeles on July 12 of that year. Unreleased vocal tracks with new instrumental backing constituted 1980's posthumous collection, Love Lives Forever. - Jason Ankeny, All Music Guide\n\ngenres: Soul, Pop-Soul, Chicago Soul, Smooth Soul, AM Pop, Uptown Soul.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Minnie+Riperton\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Kapricorn was born in Germany from South-African parents, but grew up in Tveita in Eastern Oslo. Critical was born in Norway with parents from Ethiopia and Eritrea.\n\nThey have collaborated with a variety of artists in Norway, but did first receive real commercial recognition for their work with their partners from Paperboys. The track Barcelona from Paperboys feat. Madcon was a massive hit in Norway - Barcelona won the prize for most requested video of the year from Nordic channel ZTV, and was an important factor in Paperboys winning \"Spellemannprisen\". (Norwegian equivalent to the Grammys).\n\nTshawe and Yosef were hosts of a tv-show called \"The Voice of Madcon\". The show aired Monday to Thursday from 10 PM to 11 PM on the Norwegian music channel \"The Voice\". The show features small-talk, music videos and interviews.\n\nMadcon released their first single \"God Forgive Me\" in 2000 (Virgin Records), but the first commercial breakthrough was with long time collaborators Paperboys with the hit single \"Barcelona\" in 2002 (Bonnier Amigo).\n\nIn 2004, Madcon released their first official album \"It's All A Madcon\" (AA-Recordings/Bonnier Amigo), which won them a Norwegian Grammy and several other awards.\n\nIn 2005 Madcon became TV personalities on the Nordic music channel The Voice, while growing with their music in the studio. The show \"The Voice of Madcon\" became a huge success for both Madcon and the network, showcasing the behind the scenes life of the popular group.\n\nIn late 2007 Tshawe was invited to join the popular Norwegian version of Dancing With The Stars, and was the final winner.\n\nTheir second album, entitled So Dark The Con Of Man, was released on December 3, 2007. In the UK, released on RCA, the album charted on UK Albums Chart at #137.[2] In Norway, the album was certified gold in 3 hours, and platinum in 3 days. The album featured soul singer Noora Noor and Paperboys on two of the songs.\n\nIn 2008, Madcon released a cover of a 1968 Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons song, Beggin', that earned the group several #1 chart positions in Europe (including France, Portugal, Norway and Russia), and an overall #2 position on the European Billboard Hot 100 chart. It also achieved 7 x platinum status in Norway, becoming one of the biggest hits of all time in the Norwegian charts[citation needed].\nMadcon's cover of Beggin' was produced by 3Elementz, who also produced the other singles from \"So Dark The Con Of Man\", as well as all of the tracks on the \"InCONvenient Truth\" album.\nThey performed at World Music Awards on November 10, 2008, where they also won the World's Best Selling Norwegian Artist Award.\n\nAfter several negotiations Madcon's label (Bonnier Amigo) signed a licensing agreement with SonyBMG for Central Europe, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, with Universal Republic for the US, with Warner Music for Spain, and with Just Music for South Africa.\n\nMadcon hosted the Norwegian version of Don't Forget the Lyrics!, Kan du teksten?, on TV 2 (Norway).\nTheir  album \"InCONvenient Truth\" was released all over Europe early to mid-2009, and the group had set their sights on the other major territories to release including the US, Japan and Australia in 2009.\n\nTheir song \"Glow\", which is produced by the production team ELEMENT , was the background of the \"Eurovision 2010 flashmob dance\" music video which was aired at the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 interval act, and to manys surprise, it went on to receive more fame than the winning song of the competition.\n\nMdcon got their own reality show on Norwegian TV 2 winter 2013 \"Madcons gale verden\" (The mad world of Madcon). At the same time they released their single \"In my head\".\n\n---\n\nTrivia:\nTshawe won the 2007 edition of the norwegian version of Dancing With the Stars.\n\n\nAlbum:\n\nIt's All a MadCon (2004)\nSo Dark The Con Of Man (2007)\nAn InCONvenient Truth (2008)\nContraband (2010)\nIcon (2013)\n\n Singles:\n\n\u00abGod Forgive Me\u00bb (2000)\n\u00abDoo Wop\u00bb (2004)\n\u00abInfidelty (feat.

Twintig zangeressen en een zanger o.l.v. dirigente Inge Minten laten u alle hoeken van de zaal horen tijdens hun Valentijnsconcert. Liefde is h\u00e9t thema van oneindig veel songs, maar hoe die klinken wanneer ze door KYD ge\u00efnterpreteerd worden, is steeds een verrassing. Laat je in vervoering brengen door dit unieke koor, new school en out of the box. Ce\u00e7i n\u2019est pas un choeur!<br>Kill Your Darlings: romantisch, maar met een scherp kantje.<br>\u00a0<br>KYD heeft de laatste jaren niet stilgezeten. Dat kunnen die \u2018Darlings\u2019 namelijk niet. U misschien wel, tot u ze gehoord heeft\u2026 Hier hun parcours in vogelvlucht:<br>\u00a0<br>Na het Toscaanse avontuur waar het allemaal begon ging KYD eventjes \u2018klassiek\u2019 in een project met symfonisch orkest in Diest, gaf een tv-optreden tijdens de liveshows van Stars For Life en zong een kerstconcert ten voordele van het Kinderkankerfonds en Make a Wish. Ze swingden met Sandra Kim, Ben Cramer en het harmonieorkest van Bochelt op de Boggeter Proms, verzorgden de muzikale begeleiding van \u201cLive Life Live\u201d, dansproject van Academie Merksem en eindigden op de vierde plaats in de Cobra Classic Battle van Radio 1.<br>\u00a0<br>Het Toscaanse publiek bleef hen missen en vice versa. Daarom trokken ze in 2014 met nieuw repertoire, terug naar Itali\u00eb. In hetzelfde jaar stonden ze met Natalia en het symfonieorkest Zuiderkempen op het podium en gaven een benefietconcert met Leki ten voordele van vzw Nanda. 2015: KYD \u201cademt\u201d en neemt tijd om hun repertoire uit te breiden en toch flitsen ze tussendoor naar een optreden voor Koor&Stem en verschillende priv\u00e9concerten. Kers op de taart van het harde werk in dit jaar werd het eerste KYD-concert \u201cHave a Darling Christmas\u201d in CC Oosterhof Lummen.<br>\u00a0<br>Van X-mas \u201815 naar Valentijnconcert \u201816, met orkest en Marijn De Valck, waarna een dubbelconcert met harmonieorkest Broederkring uit Houthalen-Helchteren en een concert met backing vocals van Paul Michiels. Seizoen \u201916-\u201917 werd ingezet met een concert in Nederland op festival \u201cDoe Iets\u201d, daarna traden ze op tijdens de opening van Viewmaster/Masterview 2016 in het Zuiderpershuis.

She released her debut album, Perfectionist, in 2011.\n\nKills was born in Bradford, West Yorkshire, UK, to an Afro-Jamaican father and Uruguayan mother, where she attended Bradford Girls' Grammar School. In addition, she studied classical drama at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. She stated in a post on her blog on social website, MySpace that she grew up flying between London and Florida, where she had relatives, resulting in a mixed American and English accent.\n\nKills made her acting debut at age 9 in 1995 in New Voices. She had a regular role as Sima on the TV sitcom \"All About Me\" and also played Amy Franks in the BBC's long-running radio drama \"The Archers\". She began writing songs at 14, some of which were featured in films and television shows, including \"Bring It On 4\", \"Sleepover\", \"Just My Luck\", and \"Entourage\". After finishing with \"The Archers\" in 2003, Kills began pursuing a music career and attributes her musical breakthrough to winning a Radio 1 MC Battle in Leeds under the name \"Candy Rapper\" in 2003. She signed to the UK record company \"Adventures in Music\" and released her first single Don't Play Nice under the name Verbalicious in February 2005. Kills' told W that her childhood nickname from her mother was \"Verbal\" because she talked and sang a lot. She adopted the name and variations of it as her stage name at some points during her career.\nWhile writing music for films, Kills posted her self-produced and written demo extended play, \"Womannequin\" on music social website MySpace in 2007 that attracted the attention of blogger Perez Hilton in 2008, her song received 2 million plays on the website and Kills reached the top of the unsigned artists chart. With offers coming in for concerts and festivals, Kills moved to Los Angeles. In LA, Kills was approached by producers, A&R and labels with contracts. A DJ introduced her to will.i.am after hearing her demo and learning that she did not have a record deal. In January 2008, will.i.am signed her to his record label, \"will.i.am Music Group\". She did not sign right away as she had reservations about the music industry and will.i.am had to go to London a month later to convince her to record with him. During this time she also co-wrote and appeared on They Talk Shit About Me by French recording artist M. Pokora and met underground director Guillaume Doubet, who would go on to direct many of her videos, in Paris.\n\nKills explained in an interview that she adopted the stage name Natalia Kills at the behest of her record company, which found \"Natalia Cappuccini\" hard to pronounce. She had taken on her grandmother's family name a few years prior. She explained in an interview that her stage name is based on the phrase \"you killed it\", and represents her tendency to be a perfectionist. Kills released her debut album \"Perfectionist\" in April 2011 in Germany following a top ten placing by the first single, \"Mirrors\". The album was described as a concept album by Kills, proving that perfection is attainable. It features production by Jeff Bhasker and Fernando Garibay, who had worked with Lady Gaga. The album was accompanied by four singles, Mirrors, Wonderland, Free and Kill My Boyfriend. The first three singles were minor hits in some European countries but failed to chart in the US or UK. Kills opened for Kelis' European All Hearts Tour, as well as supported Robyn on her Body Talk Tour in November 2010 and early 2011. She also supported Ke$ha on the UK leg of her Get Sleazy Tour. Throughout August and September 2011, Kills supported Katy Perry on her California Dreams Tour for eight dates in Europe and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. She also opened for the Black Eyed Peas over the summer of 2011 in Europe.\nKills is featured on a Junior Caldera single, Lights Out (Go Crazy), along with Far East Movement. It was released on March 13, 2012. Kills also features in Tatana's single, You Can't Get in My Head (If You Can't Get in My Bed).\n\nOn September 5, the singer announced new video entitled \"Controversy\" to start the promotion of her sophomore studio album entitled Trouble that's scheduled for release early 2013 through Cherrytree and Interscope Records. She also revealed the artwork with the official viral video.\n\nKills called Kate Bush and Alanis Morissette her most important musical influences, highlighting them as emotional artists who wrote honestly about their own experiences. She has also gone on to cite Gwen Stefani as her hero. She also claims that Depeche Mode, Prince, Vanity 6 and Freddie Mercury inspire her live performances.\n\nIn June of 2015, Kills announced over Twitter that her next album would feature a band, and that her days as \"Natalia Kills\" are over. She has stated \"I always wanted to start a band. I adore Hole & Garbage so that's what i'll do next. I need to go darker + wilder\".\n\nIn early 2016, Sinclair started a band, Cruel Youth. Their first song, \"Mr. Watson\", was released on Soundcloud in February, that was then followed by \"Diamond Days\" in April, which was also released on iTunes. Their third single ,\"Hatefuck\", was released in early September along with the release of their debut EP +30mg on 16 September. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Natalia+Kills\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

her own\nAnd how you left her alone\n\nAll's well at the base of the hill\nYou might need to fill\nA prescription to kill\nOff the sirens\nLook down from your tower on high\nAnd take in the night\nLook her right in the eye\nShe'll listen\n\nAnd all the gold dust in her eyes\nWon't reform into a ring\nYou had and lost\nThe one thing\nYou kept in a safe place\nRemember the face\nThe girl who had made you her own\nAnd how you left her alone\n\nLife comes to those that'll choose\nThe regular news\nOver playing the blues\nWith the light on\n\nAnd if you burn the road that'll lead you\nBack to her in time\nI'll watch you turn to stone\nCan't find the sublime\nShe's moving on\nWithout you\nThe tide breaks\nYou watch the stars fake\nThey gather you back to their home\nI guess

When close friend and actor/film-maker Zach Braff heard a demo of Radin's song \"Winter,\" he was immediately interested, and got the song onto the show Scrubs in the episode \"My Screw Up.\"  The song received an overwhelmingly positive response and gave Radin substantial exposure with the show's demographic. The songs \"Today\", \"Closer\", \"Don't Look Away\" and \"These Photographs\" were also used on the show.\n\nSince, Joshua's songs have been further featured on the FOX Television drama North Shore, Bones and the ABC medical drama Grey's Anatomy. His song \"Star Mile\" is on The Last Kiss movie soundtrack. Most recently his song \"What If You\" was featured on the Catch and Release soundtrack. He also has a couple tracks on the Adam soundtrack, including \"When I Find You.\"\n\nThe album \"We Were Here\" was released in 2006, containing many of the songs featured on the various television shows. The album is made up of heavily acoustic indie Folk/Pop, and is especially reminiscent of Simon & Garfunkel, Elliott Smith, Jode Gannon, Damien Rice and Iron & Wine.\n\nJoshua Radin is featured in Ashtar Command's song \"Mark IV\" from the band's debut LP American Sunshine. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Joshua+Radin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Venom's second album proved influential enough that its title was used as the name of an extreme metal subgenre: black metal.\n\nVenom's original personnel came from three different bands: Guillotine, Oberon and DwarfStar. The original Guillotine featured Jeffrey Dunn  and Dave Rutherford on guitars, Dean Hewitt on bass guitar, Dave Blackman on vocals and Chris Mercaters on drums. Blackman and Mercater were replaced by drummer Anthony Bray and vocalist Clive Archer of Oberon and soon after, Dean Hewitt was replaced by Alan Winston on bass. Around the summer of 1979, Conrad \"Cronos\" Lant from the bands DwarfStar and Album Graecum replaced Rutherford. Around this time, the band adopted the Venom moniker.\n\nPrime influences of the formative band were Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Mot\u00f6rhead and Kiss. Other bands cited by Venom as an inspiration are Queen, The Who, Deep Purple, Sex Pistols, Van Halen, The Tubes and The Rolling Stones.\n\nA few days before a show at a local church hall, Winston left the band. To fill in, Lant borrowed a bass guitar from Steve Thompson (later to become Venom's first producer). Playing the show with the borrowed bass plugged into his Marshall guitar amp and effects pedals, he created an unnerving racket and the 'Bulldozer Bass' was born.\n\nVenom's lyrics often featured Satanic references, and the band members took on new stage names. Archer became 'Jesus Christ', Lant 'Mr. Cronos', Bray 'Tony Abaddon', and Dunn 'Jeff Mantas'.\n\nIn April 1980, the band recorded a three song disc, featuring \"Angel Dust\", \"Raise the Dead\", and \"Red Light Fever\". Soon afterward, six more tracks were recorded for just \u00a350, with Lant taking vocal duties on the song \"Live Like an Angel\". Archer soon left the band, and Venom's line-up became a trio.\n\nVenom's recording debut was the 1981 single \"In League with Satan\"/\"Live Like an Angel\" which was released by Neat Records. Later that year they released their full-length debut, \"Welcome to Hell\".\n\nThough crudely recorded with sometimes dubious musicianship, \"Welcome to Hell\" was still a remarkable tour de force for the era. Venom's music was faster and harsher than most heavy metal contemporaries and while Satanism and other dark topics had been featured in metal before, the subject had rarely been more prominent. Lant was quoted as saying that this celebration of evil subjects was inspired by the perceived need to out-do musicians like Ozzy Osbourne of Black Sabbath, who would 'sing about evil things and dark figures, and then spoil it all by going \"Oh No, No Please God help me!\"'\n\nTheir second album, 1982's \"Black Metal\" is cited as perhaps the most important influence in the development of black metal, thrash metal, death metal, and other related styles that are often grouped under the extreme metal umbrella. Many defining elements of these genres are first found in the lyrics and song titles created by Lant and his unique singing style as well as the guitar work and solos performed by Dunn. Though they would later be cited as important, neither of Venom\u2019s first two albums sold well upon their original release. And while many of their British metal peers had found measures of popular success or critical acclaim (or, like Def Leppard, were moving away from metal towards hard rock), Venom were still regarded by critics as \"a trio of buffoons\".\n\nIn an attempt to prove their status as serious musicians, Venom recorded \"At War with Satan\" in 1983. The epic 20-minute title track, with substantial progressive rock influences, took up the first side of the LP. The B-side was focused on the rapid-fire, three-minute \"scorchers\" Venom were known for. In 1985, Venom released their fourth album, \"Possessed', which was not as successful as previous albums. Dunn then left the band to pursue a solo career.\n\nTwo guitarists, Mike Hickey and Jim Clare, were hired to replace Dunn. Their fifth album, 1987's Calm Before the Storm, moved away from Satanic themes in favor of Tolkien-esque \u201cSword and Sorcery\u201d material. This was even less successful than \"Possessed\", and Lant, Clare and Hickey all left Venom after subsequent touring to form Lant's eponymous solo band Cronos.\n\nBray was left as the only group member, but he was able to convince Music for Nations for a deal to release a new Venom album on the Under One Flag label, using Deadline demo tracks which were recorded with previous line-ups but never released. In 1988, Bray offered a vocals/bass role to Tony Dolan from Atomkraft. Bray and Dolan wrote new material prior to Dunn's rejoining the band along with rhythm guitarist Al Barnes. Together they recorded Prime Evil (1989), Tear Your Soul Apart (1990) and Temples of Ice (1991). Barnes then left the band, and Steve White from Atomkraft was hired as replacement. They released \"The Waste Lands\" in 1992, also without success. Music for Nations refused to release any more Venom albums, so Dolan and Dunn quit, effectively disbanding Venom. Bray continued to release compilation and live albums up to 1996.\n\nIn 1995, Lant, Dunn and Bray reunited the \"classic\" line-up, beginning by headlining the Waldrock Festival on 24 June 1995. They recorded and self-released the \"Venom '96\" EP with four re-recorded and one new song, resulting in a record deal with the SPV label. An album, \"Cast in Stone\", was next released in 1997, split between new material and re-recordings of popular early-'80s songs.\n\nBray left Venom in 1999 and was replaced by Lant's brother Anthony \"Antton\" Lant. This lineup released \"Resurrection\" in 2000 on SPV. However, in 2002 Dunn again left the group and was replaced by a returning Hickey. In late 2005, Venom released a career-spanning 4-disc box set \"MMV\", which includes an exclusive mini-poster of the band's seven-date tour of Europe with Metallica  and a 60 page picture book, with interviews and pictures. The set includes all their best-known songs, along with rarities like live tracks, demos and outtakes. This lineup of the band released the \"Metal Black\" album.\n\nHickey left the group 2007, with a guitarist calling himself \"Rage\" serving as his replacement. This lineup released the record \"Hell\" in 2008. Anthony Lant has since left the group and has been replaced by drummer Danny \"Dante\" Needham.\n\nCurrently, the band is in the studio recording their next album which is due for release at the end of 2010 and also negotiating some live shows afterwards. Cronos commented saying, \"There's a fresh energy with the new line-up and the sessions are going great, Dante is a really big hitter which is fantastic, his playing went down a storm with the South American Legions during our Latin American tour in December 2009.

Their music is largely instrumental-based with only a few songs containing vocal performances. The band consists of Mario Camarena (guitar), Erick Hansel (guitar), Esiah Camarena (bass) and Nathan Camarena (drums). On November 8, 2015, Chon stated via their Twitter feed that they parted ways with Drew Pelisek due to 'artistic differences'. It was also confirmed by Drew on a personal account. Since Pelisek's departure, Chon has had 3 touring bassists, including original bassist Esiah Camarena, who played bass during the Journey's Unplugged Tour. Esiah has returned as a permanent member of the band following his attendance on the Robot With Human Hair Vs. Chonzilla tour with Dance Gavin Dance.\nOn June 16, 2017, Chon released their second full-length album Homey under Sumerian Records.\nChon began in 2008 with the recording of their four-track self-titled demo. In 2010, the band began a brief hiatus, but reunited in 2011 to record two new songs, \"O.G.\" and \"Breathe\". They returned in 2013 with the release of their debut EP entitled Newborn Sun. The following year Chon released their second EP, entitled Woohoo!. In 2014, Chon embarked on two consecutive nationwide tours with Animals as Leaders. In December 2014, Chon signed with the record label Sumerian Records, and announced they would be releasing their debut full-length album the following year. On February 5, 2015, the band announced their debut full length titled Grow would be released in March 2015. On March 5, the band premiered their song Can't Wait from the album via Red Bull. They released the album on March 24. Eight days prior the band embarked on a 27 date tour supporting Circa Survive. On December 16, 2015, Chon announced their first full US headlining tour, titled the Super Chon Bros Tour, with accompanying bands Polyphia and Strawberry Girls. They sold out every single show on the tour. Chon was also an opening band during the Sonic Unrest Tour, featuring headliner Periphery, and bands Sikth and Toothgrinder.\nChon endorses Ibanez guitars and Overdrive Straps guitar straps. Guitarist Mario Camarena plays a custom guitar built by Seth Hollander in collaboration with Ibanez as well as an Ibanez RG 421. Primarily, Mario uses a Vox AC30 tube amplifier. Erick Hansel primarily plays Ibanez RG 321 and RG 421 models. Chon's early work was known to largely shun the use of effects pedals. the band started experimenting heavily with effects pedals when writing Homey.\nChon is a progressive math rock band that takes inspiration from a wide variety of sources. While their early music was more metal and shred-based, in the vein of The Fall of Troy and Necrophagist, their sound has changed with new releases. Rock bands such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers & Rush have also played a huge role in influencing Chon's later works of music. Chon have listed pianists such as Hiromi Uehara, Tigran Hamasyan, and Alex Argento as influences in their music. Chon makes extensive use of seventh chords and inversions in their songwriting, and incorporates odd time signatures typical of progressive rock. They also stand out in that they often use major keys, which gives their music an upbeat, peppy tone. Chon's 2017 album Homey saw the band experimenting for the first time with hip-hop and electronic music, most notably on their single Nayhoo.\nBand members: Mario Camarena \u2013 guitar (2008\u2013present), Nathan Camarena \u2013 drums, percussion (2008\u2013present), Erick Hansel \u2013 guitar, (2008\u2013present); vocals (2016-present), Esiah Camarena \u2013 bass guitar, vocals (2008-2010; 2016\u2013present), Former members: Drew Pelisek \u2013 bass guitar, vocals (2012\u20132016), Touring members: Brandon Ewing \u2013 bass guitar (2016, Super Chon Bros Tour) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/CHON\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A native of Nashville, Tennessee, Jack has been influenced by many styles of music and his knowledge of the history of each allows him to deliver a \u201ctrue to the tradition\u201d performance. During his colorful career, he has mastered a wide range of instruments including electric, slide, acoustic and resonator guitar, mandolin, old-time banjo and Hammond organ, which he incorporates into many musical styles such as blues & roots music; jazz & bebop; pop & rock; and bluegrass & country.

Her first big hit was the single \"My Baby Loves Me\" from her more pop-oriented second album, 1993's The Way That I Am. She became even more visible in 1994 with the crossover success of her anti-domestic violence anthem \"Independence Day\", also from this album.\n\nIn 1995 McBride released the album Wild Angels; \"Safe in the Arms of Love\" and the title track were country hits, later being her first #1 hit. Her 1997 album Evolution sold over two million units, and included an adult contemporary crossover hit in \"Valentine\" as well as four number one or number two country hits. The album Emotion came out in 1999; \"I Love You\" was a big hit in both country and adult contemporary circles. So was the socially conscious \"Love's the Only House\", a trend that would continue with 2003's \"This One's for the Girls\", which would become the theme song for the 2005 NCAA Women's Basketball championship tournament. [1] This was followed by the hit singles \"How Far\" (written by fellow country singer Jamie O'Neal) and \"God's Will\".\n\nThe Long Distance Lullaby Songfacts states that Eleven was Martina's first album for Republic Nashville, ending a 20 year association with RCA. Label head Scott Borchetta encouraged her to write more songs for the record than she had on any of her previous 10 albums, and she ended up co-writing six of the 11 tracks. Eleven was released October 11, 2011.\n\nAs of 2005 McBride is generally recognized as one of the top female singers in popular music; with her strong and pure soprano voice she has been labelled \"the C\u00e9line Dion of country music.\" Also in 2005 she released a 18-track CD of classic country music standards, which landed at #1 on the Billboard Country Album Chart in its opening week and received much critical acclaim for its authenticity towards traditional country.\n\nShe is a four-time Country Music Association Female Vocalist of the Year winner (a record she holds with Reba McEntire), three-time Academy of Country Music Female Vocalist of the Year winner and a Grammy Award winner. This left-hander performed The Star-Spangled Banner at Game 3 of the 2004 World Series. \n\n\"Independence Day\" is used as the introductory music for Sean Hannity's popular talk radio show. McBride has appeared at benefit events organized by Hannity, but has declined to take an active political stance. [2] McBride has performed free for fans, such as in a July 3, 2004 show in Owensboro, Kentucky to celebrate the grand opening of the new Independence Bank headquarters.\n \nRecently she helped out contestants on the Canadian version of \"American Idol\". The winner worked on a song with McBride as well as went on tour with her across Canada.\n\nMartina has sold over 13 million albums in USA alone.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Martina+McBride\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was co-produced by Donna Dean-Stevens, former Mercury Records artist (as Donna Meade) and widow of Country Music Hall of Fame member Jimmy Dean, along with Jim Della Croce, who also serves as Jackson&#39;s manager.Sebastian penned &quot;Nashville Cats&quot; as a tribute to Music City&#39;s endlessly creative studio musicians and recorded and released it 50 years ago, in November of 1966 with his band, The Lovin&#39; Spoonful. It promptly became a Top 10 hit and has since been recorded by acts ranging from Flatt & Scruggs to Johnny Cash. The phrase Nashville cats has long since been adopted to recognize the mastery of Nashville&#39;s exceptional musicians.Jackson is currently a headliner on the recurring Old Dominion Barn Dance in Richmond, Virginia, where he electrifies audiences with his masterful renditions of country standards. He has performed to standing-room-only crowds and is developing into a sought after touring act performing over 75 concerts annually. While the Jackson clan hails from Virginia, Tony was raised in a military family and travelled the world before graduating high school and joining the armed services himself. It was while in the Marines that he first started paying serious attention to country music. &quot;Growing up, my mother listened only to gospel,&quot; he says. &quot;My dad was into jazz, hip hop, R&B, new jack swingstuff like that. My radio station was Armed Forces Radio, which played everything. When I was living in Rota, Spain I got to meet Randy Travis while there on a USO tour. Some friends and I went out when they were setting up the stage, and we actually got to talk to him before we realized he was the guy who&#39;d be performing later. He was really cool to us. In the Marine Corps, when my friends and I played music for each other, we were all homesick. So when you&#39;d listen to these country songs that talked about family and home and heartbreak, it would really grab you. It was a combination of those things that got country on my radar.&quot;", "img": null, "title": "Tony Jackson", "url": "http://lasvegas.eventful.com/events/tony-jackson-/E0-001-106732425-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "STONEY'S ROCKIN' COUNTRY", "city": "Las Vegas"}, {"date": "2018-02-12 12:00:00", "description": " <p>Tony Starlight is an entertainer and entrepreneur.

His lengthy and distinguished career has found him in a wide variety of settings. As an avant-garde jazz pianist, he recorded with Spontaneous Music Ensemble; in the jazz fusion realm, he was a member of Gilgamesh and Barbara Thompson\u2019s Paraphernalia; as a progressive rock keyboardist, he played with Gong, Baker Gurvitz Army, the Mike Oldfield Group, Seventh Wave, and In Cahoots. Sideman credits include work with Annette Peacock, Harry Beckett, and more.<p><em>Photo of Peter Lemer by\u00a0David Coxshall.<br></em><em>Photo of John Surman\u00a0 by Ann Iren Odeby.</em> Surprisingly, Local Colour \u2013 his debut recording \u2013is Lemer&#39;s only album as a leader. Recorded in London in1966, before jazz fusion or prog-rock even existed, it belongs in the collection of anyone who cares about the British jazz scene, and not only because of Lemer&#39;s talents. Everyone in this quintet wentonto notable achievements. This was one of sax great John Surman&#39;s earliest recordings; heis now arguably the premiere British jazz saxophonist, with a prolific and much- praised discography. Chances to hear the also scintillating sax sound of the more obscureGeorge Khan in a jazz context are much rarer, though near the end of 2017 Emanem released an excellent two-disc compilation of concert recordings and prog-rock fans may remember his appearance on Robert Wyatt&#39;s Ruth Is Stranger than Richard and his work with Cream lyricist Pete Brown and The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. Drummer Jon Hiseman had already established himself on the British jazz scene byco-founding the New Jazz Orchestrain1964; two years after the Local Colour session he started Colosseum, one of the most successful British jazz-rockbands, and he and Peter even collaborated with Andrew Lloyd Webber on the musical Cats. Bassist Tony Reeves had had a hitsingle in1965 with Sounds Orchestral (&quot;Cast Your Fate to the Wind&quot;); after a brief stint with John Mayall&#39;s Bluesbreakers,Reeves joined Hiseman in Colosseum; he was also a member of Greenslade and Curved Air in addition to session workwith Fairport Convention singer Sandy Denny and guitarist John Martyn. That&#39;s a whole lot of talent in the Peter LemerQuintet! Together, they make a sort of inside/outside jazz that doesn&#39;t abandon themes and harmony butis still quitefreewheeling when it wants to be.</p></p>", "img": null, "title": "Peter Lemer Quintet 'Son Of Local Colour'  With George Khan, John Surman, Peter Lemer, Tony Reeves & Jon Hiseman", "url": "http://london.eventful.com/events/peter-lemer-quintet-son-local-colour-george-/E0-001-110180364-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United Kingdom", "venue": "Jazz @ Pizza Express Soho", "city": "City of London"}, {"date": "2018-01-24 19:30:00", "description": " Ticket Price: (All Seats) - $25 For groups of 10 or more, please call group sales direct at 561-596-6169 ext. 214.

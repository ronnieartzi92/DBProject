He began piano lessons promptly at age 5, studying at The University Of Michigan School Of Music Pedagogy program. By his early teens Andrew had already exhibited great enthusiasm and talent for both music and the visual arts. He spent his high school years playing drums and keyboard in an almost endless variety of short-lived, but passionate groups, all centered in southeast Michigan's explosive cultural scene. By the age of 17, Andrew had graduated from high school - one year early - in an effort to dedicate all his time to his creative endeavors. He was accepted to The School Of The Art Institute Of Chicago, but instead chose to move to New York City in 1997, at age 18, to pursue his vision alone.\n\nUpon arriving in New York, Andrew found odd jobs in art galleries, department stores, avant-garde fashion boutiques, selling opera tickets, and as a gumball machine salesman; anything to support his real interest: making the most exciting music he could. He pursued this goal day and night, putting all of his abilities and resources into the writing and recording of his own material. Shortening his name from Andrew Wilkes-Krier to Andrew W.K., he set out on a mission to get his music heard not only in New York, but also around the world. Without a band or even a partner, Andrew began performing solo concerts anywhere he could get them. Using only a keyboard, drum machine, and his voice, Andrew played shows up and down the east coast. He vowed to play any show, any place, any time, and wound up performing everywhere from coffee houses to basements. Quickly the word spread of the energy and raw excitement of Andrew and the music, and soon he found himself performing for larger crowds. After performing several shows with friends and fellow New York performers, Fishcerspooner, Andrew was invited to play 2 engagements at a popular Belgian Arts Festival called Over The Edges. This was only the very beginning of a fast and wild ride.\n\nAndrew signed a recording contract with Island Def Jam Records/Universal Music, and began the recording of his debut full-length CD. Titled I GET WET, the album's release in 2001 caused a widespread and diverse wave of reaction, landing Andrew on the covers of international music magazines, like the UK's NME, which featured him not once, but twice on the cover of the same issue (adding an additional page to accommodate the double image). More press followed, catapulting Andrew to overnight exposure in the international music world. Magazines worldwide praised the originality and undeniable intensity of his music, and articles in GQ, Rolling Stone, Spin, Q, Mojo, New York Magazine, Vanity Fair, Jane, The New Yorker, FHM, Playboy, Oui, The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Alternative Press, i-D, The Face, Dazed & Confused, Bizzare, Newsweek, The New York Post, Stuff, The Washington Post, The Village Voice, and dozens and dozens and dozens of others, the world over, all agreed that the A.W.K. style had made a mark in the wide world of music.\n\nNow that Andrew W.K. had arrived, it was time to take the music to the stage, and Andrew had to form a band. Instead of auditioning random applicants, Andrew decided to write a letter to his favorite drummer, a man named Donald Tardy, who plays in the band Obituary. Andrew sent Donald the music and asked if he would join his band. Having no expectations, Andrew was shocked when Tardy wrote back and agreed to play the music. After Donald came an additional 7 musicians, including Gregg Roberts (bass guitar, vocals), Sgt. Frank (guitar), Jimmy Coup (guitar, vocals), Kendall A. (guitar, vocals), E. Payne (guitar, vocals), John Sutton (guitar), and even a second drummer, Richie Russo, who played on stage next to Donald, in perfect synchronicity. Andrew relocated to Brandon, Florida, in order to rehearse with the band and prepare the music for live performances. Immediately following the release of I GET WET, Andrew W.K. and his newly formed band began a world tour, which would continue for 3 years and over 500 concerts. Major U.S. tours, including highly coveted Ozzfest and Warped Tour dates, as well as countless hall and arena shows with everyone from Aerosmith, to The Locust, gave the music even further exposure and proved that A.W.K. music goes beyond genre and classifaction - it seemed purely \"a man and music\". Major network television appearances on Saturday Night Live, Late Night With Conan O'Brien, Last Call With Carson Daly, The Daily Show With Jon Stewart, CNN, Fox Sports, Access Hollywood, Top Of The Pops, VH1, and MTV led to an eventual T.V. series of his own, entitled Your Friend, Andrew W.K. The show featured Andrew giving personal advice to fans who wrote in asking for help. MTV2 presented the series, along with countless other Andrew W.K. appearances on MTV, VH1, Much Music, and FUSE.\n\nIn the midst of his non-stop schedule, Andrew recorded and released his second album, THE WOLF, which was received with enthusiasm by both fans and the media alike. The album was recorded much in the same tradition Andrew established with his earliest songs: Andrew himself playing every instrument, and recording track after track of music, with each song tracking at least 90 individual parts, if not 200 or more individual tracks. Andrew and his band took the new album to the stage and performed tours across the globe, including festivals in Reading, Leeds, Tokyo, Osaka, and Taiwan. During this wave of shows, Andrew broke his foot on stage while getting tangled in his own microphone cable. Rather than sit it out and heal at home, W.K. decided to continue the tour, and played the remaining 60 shows in a wheelchair. One of these performances was filmed at the Spike T.V. Video Game Awards. Earlier in the year, W.K. had sustained a head injury during the filming of his music video, We Want Fun, with director Spike Jonze, for the Jackass Movie soundtrack. Despite these physical setbacks, the music continued and the party continues to spread, one person at a time.\n\nAt the close of 2004, Andrew began work on the massive WHO KNOWS? live-concert movie. In it, more than 300 hours of live concert footage, spanning 1992-2004, was condensed into a rapid-fire viewing experience. The film was edited using a special multi-track video process, in which multiple performances can be synchronized and layered together, with the audio and video overlapping to create a seamless sequence of shots from different concerts. The layering process of the video is similar to the layering process Andrew uses to record his music, and when performing. The movie was screened at sell-out shows in New York City and Hollywood, where Andrew performed in-person piano solos. WHO KNOWS? was released on DVD by Music Video Distributors / R. Jayne / R.C.U. Video.\n\nAndrew W.K. released his third album, entitled \"Close Calls With Brick Walls\" in Spring 2006. The album was released exclusively in Asia due to legal issues surrounding usage of the name \"Andrew W.K.\"  Andrew toured both South Korea and Japan extensively in 2006. .\n\nIn December 2009, a lecture recorded at Madame Jojo's in London in September 2008 was published online. In it Andrew W.K. claimed that the Andrew W.K. persona was created by a committee including himself, his father, and other individuals, and that he was the \"next person playing Andrew W.K.\" Claiming, \"I'm not the guy you've seen from the I Get Wet album... I'm not that same person. I don't just mean that in a philosophical or conceptual way. It's not the same person at all.\" Andrew W.K. later went on to clarify that he believed that he, as well as his fans that have followed him since the original album, have become \"different people.\"\n\nHe went further on to say: \"Andrew W.K. was created by a large group of people. They met, and I was there, and we talked about how we could come up with something that would move people. It was done in the spirit of commerce. It was done in the spirit of entertainment, which usually goes hand in hand with commerce. I was auditioned, along side many other people, to fill this role of a 'great frontman', 'a great performer'. On the one hand it may be a little scary to admit this to you all, that I may not be exactly who you thought I was, and that the guy who was, in fact, first hired as Andrew W.K. is a different person than the guy sitting here on the stage tonight. I'm the next person who is playing Andrew W.K.\"\n\nHowever On Tuesday 24 February, 2010, Andrew WK hosted an event Santos Party House in New York, where members of the public could ask him anything they liked.  He stated that \"I am Andrew W.K., the same that has been here from the beginning... I am... I am, I am the same Andrew W.K. at this appearance as at all Andrew W.K.-related appearances.\"\n\nLater in 2010 due to finding a loophole in his contractual agreements he was able to release his 2006 album \"Close Calls With Brick Walls\" world wide. He released this along with another album  called \"Mother Of Mankind\" which contained rare and unreleased tracks from 1999 right through to 2010. \nHe still lives in New York City.\n\nIn 2011, he released an EP called the \"Party all Goddamn night\" EP.

The singer who put the rude in rude boy, Max Romeo was responsible for launching an entirely new sub-genre of reggae, whose overtly suggestive lyrics caused an outcry but took a massive hold of the music scene regardless. Yet innuendo was the least of the singer's stylings, previous to the release of his infamous \"Wet Dream,\" Romeo had garnered a string of sweet hits with the vocal trio the Emotions. And once the nocturnal naughtiness faded, the singer established himself as one of the most important figures in the roots scene.\nHe left home at the age of 14 and worked on a sugar plantation outside Clarendon, cleaning out irrigation ditches, before winning a local talent competition when he was 18; prompting a move to the capital, Kingston, in order to achieve a successful musical career.\n\nIn 1965 he joined up with Kenneth Knight and Lloyd Shakespeare in The Emotions, whilst also working as a record plugger for Ken Lack's Caltone label. The group were unsuccessful in auditions for other producers, but Lack offered them an audition after overhearing Smith singing to himself as he worked one day. In 1966, the group had their first hit, with the Lack-produced, \"Buy You a Rainbow\". The Emotions went on to have several hit singles and by 1968, the singer, by this point known as Max Romeo, felt confident enough to launch a solo career. Working with producer Bunny Lee, the young star recorded a number of pop songs, mainly love ballads, but they failed to be popular and so he returned to The Emotions, now recording for Phil Pratt. During this time he began work as a sales representative for Bunny Lee and did some recording with The Hippy Boys, which would later became The Upsetters.\n\nLater on in 1968, Romeo wrote new lyrics for the rhythm track of Derrick Morgan's \"Hold You Jack\" and handed them over to Lee. Morgan, who was due to add his vocals to the track, ultimately gave it a miss, as did several other vocalists (including John Holt and Slim Smith), leading the producer to turn to Romeo to sing the lyrics he had written. The result, \"Wet Dream\", was an instant hit in Jamaica, although in the UK it was met with a BBC Radio ban, despite Romeo's somewhat-disingenuous claim that the song was actually about a roof that has a leak. Still, the ban only made it more popular and the single charted in the Top Ten, in the UK Singles Chart, spending almost six months therein, before featuring on his LP, A Dream, which included several follow-up singles in a similar vein, such as \"Mini Skirt Version\", \"Fish in the Pot\", \"Belly Woman\", and \"Wine Her Goosie\". A UK tour also met with Romeo being banned from performing at several venues, although many allowed him to play, the singer staying in the UK for eighteen months.\n\nIn 1970, Romeo returned to Jamaica and set-up Romax, an unsuccessful record label and sound system. Following which, he recorded several singles, mainly with old producer Bunny Lee, before going on to work a host of other producers including Niney Holness. This was followed by a period of which saw the release of a series of politically charged singles, most advocating the democratic socialist People's National Party (PNP), which chose his song, \"Let The Power Fall On I\", as their campaign theme for the 1972 Jamaican general election. Romeo joined the PNP Musical Bandwagon, travelling around Jamaica, playing on the back of a truck. After this, Romeo recorded a number of religious songs, until he worked with producer Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, producing the classic singles \"Three Blind Mice\" (an adaptation of the nursery rhyme with lyrics about a police raid on a party), \"Sipple Out Deh\", and \"Chase the Devil\". A remixed version of \"Sipple Out Deh\", entitled \"War Ina Babylon\", was another popular track in the UK, the first fruits of his deal with Island Records, and was followed by an album of the same name, and a follow-up single \"One Step Forward\". Shortly after this the pair fell out, leaving Romeo to self-produce his follow-up album, Reconstruction, which could not match the success of its predecessor. Perry's animosity towards Romeo was demonstrated by his single \"White Belly Rat\", with Perry also writing the word 'Judas' over a photograph of Romeo on the wall of his Black Ark studio.\n\nHe moved to New York City in 1978, where he co-wrote (with Hair producer Michael Butler) the musical, Reggae, which he also starred in. In 1980 he appeared as a backing vocalist on \"Dance\" on The Rolling Stones album Emotional Rescue. In 1981, the favour was returned when Keith Richards (of The Rolling Stones) co-produced and played on Romeo's album, Holding Out My Love to You. The rest of his output during the decade went practically unnoticed, with Romeo finding work at a New York electronics store. He returned to Jamaica in 1990, and began touring and recording more regularly.\n\nHe visited the UK again in 1992, recording the albums Far I Captain of My Ship and Our Rights with Jah Shaka. In 1995 he recorded Cross of the Gun with Tappa Zukie, and he joined up with UK rhythm section/production team Mafia & Fluxy in 1999 for the album Selassie I Forever.\n\nHis music has been sampled by other artists; The Prodigy sampled his track \"Chase the Devil\" for their 1992 UK Top Ten hit \"Out of Space\". Kanye West has also used samples from it to produce Jay-Z's hit song \"Lucifer\", which appeared on Jay-Z's 2003 release - The Black Album.\n\n\"Chase the Devil\" is featured on the reggae radio station K-JAH Radio West in a popular videogame Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, released in October 2004. Romeo's single \"Sipple Out Deh\" appeared in John Peel's Record Box.\n\n\n- Albums:\nA Dream (1970) Trojan \nLet The Power Fall (1972) Dynamic \nRevelation Time (1975) Black World \nWar Ina Babylon (1976) Island \nReconstruction (1979) Island \nI Love My Music (1979) Wackies \nRondos (1980) King Kong \nHolding Out My Love to You (1981) Shanachie \nTransition (1989) Rohit \nFari - Captain of My Ship (1992) Jah Shaka \nOur Rights (1992) Jah Shaka \nCross or the Gun (1995) Tappa Zukie \nSelassie I Forever (1999) Mafia & Fluxy \nLove Message (1999) Warriors \nSomething is Wrong (1999) Warriors \nIn This Time (2001) 3D (Max Romeo & Tribu Acustica) \nPocomania Songs (2007) Ariwa Sounds \n- Compilations:\nMax Romeo Meets Owen Gray At King Tubby's Studio (1984) Culture Press (with Owen Gray) \nMax Romeo and the Upsetters (1989) \nWet Dream (1993) Crocodisc \nMcCabee Version (1995) Sonic Sounds \nOpen The Iron Gate (1999) Blood & Fire \nThe Many Moods of Max Romeo (1999) Jamaican Gold \nPray For Me: The Best of Max Romeo 1967-73 (2000) Trojan Records \nPerilous Times (2000) Charmax \nOn The Beach (2001) Culture Press \nThe Coming of Jah (2002) Trojan \nUltimate Collection (2003) (compiled by David Katz) \nHoly Zion (2003) Burning Bush \nWet Dream: The Best of Max Romeo (2004) Trojan \nCrazy World of Dub (2005) Jamaican Recordings \n\nOne of Jamaica's most provocative lyricists, a singer who gave us such enduring songs as 'Chase The Devil' (which was sampled in the song 'Out of Space' by The Prodigy and the song 'Lucifer' by Jay-Z), 'Public Enemy Number One', 'One Step Forward' and 'Three Blind Mice'. It was Romeo who first introduced Britain to the concept of rude reggae with 'Wet Dream', which, despite a total radio ban, reached number 10 in the UK charts in May 1969.\nIn 1972 Romeo began working with producer Lee \"Scratch\" Perry. 'Babylon Burning', 'Three Blind Mice' and 'The Coming Of Jah' all maintained his star status in Jamaica between 1972 and 1975. Revelation Time was one of the best albums of 1975, and 1976's War Ina Babylon was hailed by the rock press as an all-time classic reggae album. Two outstanding contributions that will remain classic recordings from the so-called \u2018golden age\u2019 of Jamaican reggae music. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Max+Romeo\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

C\u2019est une r\u00e9v\u00e9lation, donc, autant pour lui que pour nous : sur Grand Chien, Barbagallo fait feu des mots et accents de sa langue maternelle (le fran\u00e7ais singulier de son Albi natale) et tombe, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, le masque, en embrassant d\u2019un seul geste jusqu\u2019aux recoins les plus complexes de son identit\u00e9, et en se d\u00e9barrassant des formules toutes faites de la pop dans la parlure de Shakespeare et Elvis Presley.

He was soon joined by Laetitia Abello (vocals), David Borras (keyboards) and Olivier Scalia (bass). They played their first gigs in 2004.\n\nBehind the omnipresent melody, Kid Francescoli offers intimate lyrics in English and Italian, many dealing with young men's angst and the dreams of a girl at the dawn of her thirtieth birthday. The music, with its tenacious refrains and its heartfelt instrumentals, shows the inspiration of Air and Grandaddy. At the same time, Italian acts like Cinecitta Ennio Morricone's sound tracks are an obvious influence for this group from Marseilles.\n\nAfter showing promise as a live act, especially during the Marsatac 2005 festival, the group launched their first national tour (Paris, Marseilles, Bordeaux, Rennes, Nice) in May 2006, sharing the stage with artists such Sebastien Schuller or Troy Von Balthazar. \n\nKid Francescoli have just released their first album.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kid+Francescoli\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

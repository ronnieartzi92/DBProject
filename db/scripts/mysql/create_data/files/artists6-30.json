Since then, he has released yet another global shaker: his bootleg &quot;Mercy&quot; remix collaboration with LA based producer Salva. The track had 120,000 views on Soundcloud in 2 days. RL Grime is reshaping electronic production. His melodically infused, Houston influenced flavor is connecting the roots of southern hip hop with the new age of electronic dance music and in turn dictating our understanding of what it means to be a 21st century producer.", "img": null, "title": "RL Grime", "url": "http://lasvegas.eventful.com/events/rl-grime-/E0-001-110303969-1@2018013122?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Intrigue Nightclub", "city": "Las Vegas"}, {"date": "2018-01-17 22:00:00", "description": " <br> When the two worlds of electronic music DJs/producers Kenny Beats (aka Kenneth Blume) and Ryan Marks collided in 2009, something magical happened.This dynamic duo is best known as LOUDPVCK.

At the mere age of 29, A-Trak has had two distinct phases to his winding 11 year career. Stage one: after winning the World DMCs at age 15 (in 1997), he spent years as one of hip hop\u2019s most renowned selectors. After taking over tour DJ duties for Kanye West in 2004, just as he was beginning to combine a bigger variety of sounds into his sets, A-Trak launched into stage two: becoming an undisputed icon for a generation of kids that worship hip hop and dance music alike, and commencing a worldwide boundary-blurring takeover. It all started very early, and developed very quickly, for A-Trak. As a young teenager in Montreal, he would scratch on one turntable for his brother (of Chromeo) Dave\u2019s high school band. He begun practising, \u201cwith the discipline of a monk\u201d, and after winning the Canadian, and later World, DMCs found himself an honorary member of Q-Bert\u2019s legendary Skratch Piklz crew. He soon hooked up with DJ Craze and joined another famous scratch troupe, The Allies, and spent half a decade touring as hip hop\u2019s hottest turntablist crew. Five years ago, after a chance meeting with Kanye West at a London in-store, A-Trak performed his first gig with the superstar, without a rehearsal, in front of 12,000 people \u2013 and from then on did every show with him for four years. Three years ago, after meeting the rising Chicagoan rapper Kid Sister, A-Trak began dabbling his way into production, which \u2013 also by way of happenstance - led to the beginnings of a record label. Ironically named Fool\u2019s Gold, considering how many prosperous treasures it\u2019s unearthed, the label has gone on to become one of the most sought-after imprints on the underground radar: a cross-over idol that\u2019s wildly and unpretentiously united the worlds of club music and hip hop.\n\n==Titles and Awards==\n\n*1997 Canadian DMC Champion\n*1997 Technics / DMC World Champion (15 years old - youngest ever)\n*1998 Technics DMC World finals (3rd place)\n*1999 ITF Western Hemisphere Scratch Champion\n*1999 ITF Advancement World Champion\n*1999 Vestax Extravaganza World Champion\n*2000 West Coast Technics / DMC Team Champion\n*2000 Technics / DMC Team World Champion\n*2000 ITF Advancement World Champion\n\n==Discography==\n*''[[Gangsta Breaks]]'' (12\")\n*''[[Buck Tooth Wizards]]'' (CD)\n*''[[The Grill/Like (with Obscure Disorder)]]'' (12\")\n*''[[Enter Ralph Wiggum]]'' (7\")\n*''[[Monkey Boy Breaks]]'' (12\")\n*''[[Don't Fool With The Dips]]'' (12\")\n*''[[Oh No You Didn't!

The band records for the label Saddle Creek Records, which is one of the Saddle Creek flagship artists. The band was formed in 1995 by Tim Kasher, Matt Maginn, Steve Pedersen (all formerly of Slowdown Virginia), and drummer Clint Schnase. In 1997, they released Such Blinding Stars For Starving Eyes. After a few years of touring the band broke up in 1998. They posthumously released The Storms of Early Summer: Semantics of Song in the fall of that year. A year later in the summer of 1999 the band reformed. Pedersen had started law school so Ted Stevens (formerly of Lullaby for the Working Class) stepped in and joined the band. In 2000, their album, Domestica, a concept album written like a one-act play documenting the lies, hate and deceit associated with a divorce, gained them much attention from fans and critics alike and they toured with At the Drive-In.\n\nCursive added Gretta Cohn in 2001 on cello. The strings added complimentary sounds to that summer's Burst and Bloom. In 2002, the band toured on the Take Action! Tour.\n\nSaddle Creek Records released The Ugly Organ in 2003, a series of internal monologues that reflects insecurities and self-doubt amidst the turmoil of life on an ever-turning emotional carousel. The music magazine, Rolling Stone, gave the album a 4-star rating, while alternative music magazine Alternative Press rated the album a perfect 5 out of 5. In 2004 The Cure selected Cursive to tour with them on their Curiosa tour. Afterwards the band went on hiatus with no specified return date.\n\nThe label put out a compilation album of unreleased songs and B-sides, The Difference Between Houses and Homes on August 9, 2005. In mid-2005 Gretta left the band to pursue other musical opportunities. Instead of replacing her, the band remained a four-piece.\n\nAfter Cursive's hiatus, Saddle Creek announced that Kasher had temporarily stopped his work on his side project, The Good Life, to start recording an album with Cursive. The new album, Happy Hollow (named for an area of Omaha around Happy Hollow Boulevard, running parallel to Saddle Creek Road, and, perhaps, a comment on midwestern city life), was released August 22, 2006. Its first single was \"Dorothy At Forty,\" released on July 11th, 2006. With this album Kasher turned his focus away from self-reflective lyrics to concentrate on what he thought were bad politics, empty suburban lives, and religious hypocrisy. Music Magazines Spin, URB, Time Out New York and Blender gave the record a 4 star rating, and Rolling Stone, gave the album a 3.5-star rating, while alternative music magazine Alternative Press rated the album a perfect 5 out of 5 saying \u201cCursive haven't just redefined their sound--they've transcended it.\u201d Happy Hollow features a five-piece horn section, a concept first introduced on the songs \"Art is Hard\" and \"Gentleman Caller\" on \"The Ugly Organ\"\n\nThe October following the release, the band revealed plans to bring audience participation to its catalog, offering fans a chance to remix its song \"Bad Sects\" through a competition on the website. The finalist is scheduled to appear as a B-side on an upcoming Cursive single. Cursive released their latest album, \"Mama, I'm Swollen\", on March 10th, 2009.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cursive\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He is best known for his soulful, bluesy approach to the alto saxophone, although in his formative years he was, as many were of the bebop era, heavily influenced by Charlie Parker.\n\nDonaldson attended North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro in the early 1940s. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy during World War II and was trained at the Great Lakes bases in Chicago, where he was introduced to bop music in the lively club scene there. At the war's conclusion, he returned to Greensboro, where he worked club dates with the Rhythm Vets, a combo composed of A and T students who had served in the U.S. Navy. The band recorded the soundtrack to a musical comedy featurette, \"Pitch a Boogie Woogie,\" in Greenville, North Carolina, in the summer of 1947. The movie had a limited run at black audience theatres in 1948 but its production company, Lord-Warner Pictures, folded and never made another film. \"Pitch a Boogie Woogie\" was subsequently restored by the American Film Institute in 1985 and re-premiered on the campus of East Carolina University in Greenville the following year. Donaldson and the surviving members of the Vets performed a reunion concert after the film's showing. In the documentary made on \"Pitch\" by UNC-TV, \"Boogie in Black and White\", Donaldson and his musical cohorts recall the film's making\u2014he originally believed that he had played clarinet on the soundtrack. A short piece of concert footage from a gig in Fayetteville, North Carolina, is included in the documentary.\n\nDonaldson's first jazz recordings were with the Charlie Singleton Orchestra in 1950 and then with bop emissaries Milt Jackson and Thelonious Monk in 1952, and he participated in several small groups with other jazz luminaries such as trumpeter Blue Mitchell, pianist Horace Silver and drummer Art Blakey.\n\nIn 1953, he also recorded sessions with the trumpet virtuoso Clifford Brown, and Philly Joe Jones.\nHe was a member of Art Blakey's Quintet and appeared on some of their best regarded albums, including the two albums recorded at Birdland in February 1954 Night at Birdland.\nDonaldson has recorded in the bop, hard bop, and soul jazz genres. For many years his pianist was Herman Foster.\nHe was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame on October 11, 2012.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lou+Donaldson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Lindeman&#39;s third record, Loyalty, was recorded at LaFrette studios, just outside of Paris, in collaboration with Afie Jurvanen (Bahamas) and Robbie Lackritz (Feist). It was released in May 2015 on Paradise of Bachelors (US/ Europe), Outside Music (Canada), and Spunk Records (Australia). The Weather Station has blossomed from a mostly solo folk act into a strong live band.

Self-titled and self-produced, the album unearths a vital new energy from Lindeman&#39;s acclaimed songwriting practice, marrying it to a bold new sense of confidence. Throughout, the record grapples with some of the darkest material Lindeman has yet approached: it is, according to her, the first album on which she touches on her personal experiences of mental illness. And yet the gesture inherent to the record is one of unflinching embrace. Despite it all, the characters &quot;fall down laughing, effervescent, and all over nothing, all over nothing.&quot; &quot;Well, I guess I got the hang of it&quot; she sings wryly, &quot;the impossible.&quot; By saying more than ever before, The Weather Station seeks to reveal the unnamable, the unsayable void that lies beneath language and relationships.

One day, Tamara Lindeman sat down to make music she had never heard.  Using her banjo, her voice, a borrowed microphone, and a selection of percussive household items, Tamara taught herself to write, then to record.  Slowly she cut together her musical exploration of loss and everything that comes along with it.\n\nThe urgings of friends led to the assembly of a five piece band.  With banjo, mandolin, violin, and other wooden wonders, they re-interpreted her music, both broadening it and strengthening it as they brought it out into the world of live performance.\n\nThis is music about landscapes, both broad and cramped; the running away and the running to; high winds and crushing distance; bracken and tundra and bush. This is music for the east coast, for urban confusion and rural absolutes.  It began as music about sadness, but it has always been propelled by fierce determination.\n\nThis is music that Tamara Lindeman can no longer contain. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Weather+Station\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Both onstage in front of thousands or alone in a room with his guitar, the North Carolina singer-songwriter knows who he is, where he comes from and where he wants to go. And on his debut album for River House Artists/Columbia Nashville, This One&#39;s for You, he invites listeners to share in his remarkable journey.Like its title suggests, the album is a sincere offering of thanks: to his mom and dad who gave him his first guitar; to the friends who made up his first band; and especially to the fans who supported him since his humble days singing in restaurants in Boone, North Carolina. It was those very gigs, nightly three-hour marathons at eateries around the college town, that taught Luke how to grab and hold the attention of his audience.&quot;My strategy was if I could sing my ass off on cover songs like Skynyrd&#39;s &#39;Simple Man,&#39; that&#39;d get people to put their food down for a minute. Then I&#39;d play an original song right after that and I&#39;d have them,&quot; says Luke.The shrewd idea worked, and soon the young artist with a knack for crafting imagery-rich, real-life songs was building a solid fan base, one that would follow him to bars throughout North Carolina or online via the viral YouTube and Vine performance videos he posted. Aware that he was capturing lightning in a bottle, he assembled some of his most popular tracks for a series of successful EPs and, with their impressive sales, was able to finance a move to Nashville.Luke, who was working two &quot;mega brutal&quot; jobs, at a go-kart track and at an outlet store, gave his notice and split. &quot;I quit my jobs and haven&#39;t had one since,&quot; he says &quot;That was &#39;making it&#39; to me.&quot;But the ballcap-and-boots singer is selling himself short, because the exceptional This One&#39;s for You and its hit single &quot;Hurricane&quot; portend much more is to come.A collection of 12 songs all written by Luke, often with frequent collaborators Ray Fulcher and James McNair, This One&#39;s for You paints the most relatable of pictures. Songs like the driving &quot;Hurricane&quot; and the cautionary &quot;One Number Away&quot; capture the essence of heartbreak and bad decisions, while the winking &quot;When It Rains ItPours&quot; and boozy &quot;Beer Can&quot; celebrate life&#39;s little victories. In every song on the album, there&#39;s at least one lyric that will elicit a knowing &quot;I&#39;ve been there&quot; from fans.And that&#39;s the other secret to Luke&#39;s grass-roots success. His fans see themselves reflected in both his songs and his everyguy demeanor. Just like them, he busts his back so he can appreciate even the smallest of luxuries.&quot;I&#39;m a guy you can go have a beer with and not worry that I&#39;m gonna talk about Maseratis and exotic vacations,&quot; he laughs, exuding a refreshing innocence. &quot;I would love to go to the Cayman Islands as much as the next guy, but I don&#39;t even have a passport. I had never been on a plane until I was 25. So the fans see I&#39;m a lot like them. They see I&#39;m working hard especially with my songs. I didn&#39;t just go pick out a bunch of songs that I thought people would relate to.&quot;Instead, he lived them and harnessed those experiences for his lyrics. In the moody, vulnerable &quot;One Number Away,&quot; he&#39;s tempted with dialing those forbidden digits. &quot;How many people have ever had too much to drink and picked up their cellphone and called someone they shouldn&#39;t have?&quot; he asks. &quot;Everyone has done that.&quot;Likewise, everyone has cringed when they have unexpectedly bumped into their ex at a bar. Which is why &quot;Hurricane&quot; was such a breakthrough for Luke: he captured that universal awkwardness perfectly, not in a ballad, but in a roof-raising sing- along that has become a cornerstone of his concerts.But even Luke will tell you that his best songs are the ones that bust common phrases wide open. In &quot;Don&#39;t Tempt Me,&quot; he dares you to show him a good time; &quot;Be Careful What You Wish For&quot; laments the things he no longer has; and in &quot;I Got Away With You,&quot; he delivers a manly love song about making off with his lady&#39;s heart.It&#39;s the Nineties country homage &quot;When It Rains It Pours,&quot; however, that best shows off Luke&#39;s way with words, as he celebrates a deluge of good fortune after a breakup. It&#39;s an exceptionally thought-out song, with lyrics that eschew the abstract for the concrete. A winning scratch-off ticket, a waitress&#39;s number on the back of a check and a used four-wheeler all figure into the narrative.&quot;It reminds me of a Brad Paisley song, when he does those really cheeky, clever songs like &#39;I&#39;m Gonna Miss Her,&#39;&quot; says Luke. &quot;I&#39;m influenced a lot by the smart lyrics of Paisley and especially Eric Church. I love writing about old sayings and colloquialisms and flipping them upside-down.&quot;Luke does likewise with &quot;This One&#39;s for You,&quot; the album&#39;s title track and its high- water mark. While its title may hint at a beer-drinking anthem, it&#39;s actually a love note to the ones who&#39;ve supported him along the way. &quot;There are a couple people that I owe a beer to / and three or four I owe more than a few,&quot; he sings in the opening line.&quot;My friends, the guys in my band and my parents helped me through so much and were always very encouraging. That&#39;s where this song was born from and why it&#39;s very special to me,&quot; he says. &quot;I named the album that because it sums up my whole life.&quot;In the end, This One&#39;s for You, produced by Scott Moffatt, showcases a singer and writer unafraid to tell his story without pretension or from behind a false front.

Nach einigen Umbesetzungen entsteht 2007 ein erstes Demo namens \u201eThe Aurora Veil\u201c, das schon drei der Songs enth\u00e4lt, die sp\u00e4ter auf dem Deb\u00fctalbum erscheinen werden. Die musikalische Ausrichtung basiert zwar auf Extreme Metal, zeigt aber auch ein breites Spektrum von Death, Black, Thrash und Melodic Metal bis zu klassischen Jazz-, Avantgarde- und Flamenco-Einfl\u00fcssen. Im Mai 2012 erscheint dann mit \u201ePortal Of I\u201d das Deb\u00fctalbum. Kurz danach geht die Band auf Tour, sie spielt auch zum ersten Mal au\u00dferhalb Australiens, in Japan, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong und Thailand. Au\u00dferdem headlinen sie die Festivaltour \u201aProgfest 2012\u2018 in Australien. Das Album kommt in der Heimat so gut an, dass sogar ein Song daraus (\u201eAnd Plague Flowers The Kaleidoscope\u201d) in das Curriculum des \u201aSydney Conservatorium of Music\u2018 aufgenommen wird, wo Sch\u00fcler die Komposition analysieren m\u00fcssen. Der Zweitling \u201eCitadel\u201c wird 2013 aufgenommen, im November 2014 \u00fcber die franz\u00f6sische Plattenfirma Seasons Of Mist ver\u00f6ffentlicht und erreicht Platz 42 der offiziellen Album-Charts.\u00a0<p>\u00a0<p>Im Juni 2014 k\u00fcndigt das Sextett an, die n\u00e4chste 37.500 US-Dollar teure Welttournee \u00fcber eine Crowdfunding-Kampagne zu finanzieren. Das gesetzte Ziel wird schon nach 38 Stunden erreicht. Am Ende stehen 56.644 US-Dollar zu Buche, ein neuer Rekord f\u00fcr Australien. Die so finanzierte Tour bringt Ne Obliviscaris erneut nach Asien, wo sie Fleshgod Apocalypse supporten. Sie setzen aber auch nach Europa und Nordamerika \u00fcber, wo sie mit den britischen Dark Metallern Cradle of Filth touren. Zum ersten Mal treten sie auch in Indien auf, genauer gesagt auf dem \u201aUnmaad Festival\u2018 in Bangalore. Im Juli 2016 beginnt die Band ihre erste eigene Headliner-Tour durch Nordamerika, es folgen Shows in Gro\u00dfbritannien und Irland im Oktober mit dem Support Oceans of Slumber aus Atlanta. Zusammen mit den norwegischen Extreme Metallern Enslaved touren sie auch in Kontinentaleuropa zwischen September und November 2016. Eine f\u00fcr \u00a0Fr\u00fchjahr 2017 geplante Tour durch Europa kann nicht stattfinden, da Bassist Brendan \u201aCygnus\u2018 Brown im Januar aufgrund privater Turbulenzen von seinen Bandverpflichtungen befreit wird. Mit seinem Ersatz Robin Zielhorst (u.a. Ex-Cynic) spielen Ne Obliviscaris das neue Album \u201eUrn\u201c ein. Es ist ihr drittes, das am 27. Oktober 2017 erscheint. Mit seinem neuen, dynamischeren Sound geh\u00f6rt es zum Besten, was ihre Diskographie bisher zu bieten hat.

Auf der gerade beendeten US-Tour mit der Extreme Metal-Band Allegaeon aus Colorado begleitet sie \u00fcbrigens Bassist Martino Garattoni, der auch auf den deutschen Gigs im April zu sehen sein wird.

Francesco Struglia joined the band after on Drums but left in 2008 due to personal interest change and other commitments. The band was previously known as the death/thrash metal act Tyrannic Ethical Reconstruction.\n\nThe band self-released their demo Promo '07 in August 2007, which lead to them being signed to Neurotic Records. The two songs included on the demo were also released in 2008 on the split album The Da Vinci Death Code with countrymen Modus Delicti, Onirik and Septycal Gorge.\n\nThe band has supported major artists on tour including Behemoth, Origin, Dying Fetus, Hate Eternal, Suffocation and Napalm Death. In late 2008, they started to work on their debut album and left Neurotic Records as they wanted to progress as a band. They were picked up by Willowtip Records on the 19th December 2008.\n\nThe album \"Oracles\" was released in Europe on the 30th of March 2009 by Candlelight Records and worldwide on the 21st of April by Willowtip Records.\n\nOfficial Myspace <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fleshgod+Apocalypse\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In 1986, she founded a trio with bassist David Piltch and pianist Aaron Davis. Offered a record deal in 1989, the Holly Cole Trio released an EP, Christmas Blues, that year, which featured a version of The Pretenders' \"2,000 Miles\". This was followed by their first full album, Girl Talk, in 1990.\n\nA succession of releases followed through the early 1990s. For example, 1991's Blame It On My Youth, covered songs by Tom Waits (\"Purple Avenue\", aka \"Empty Pockets\"), Lyle Lovett (\"God Will\"), includes show tunes such as \"If I Were a Bell\" (from Guys and Dolls) and \"On the Street Where You Live\" (from My Fair Lady), and even remakes \"Trust In Me\", from Disney's The Jungle Book, into a strikingly sultry and sinister song of seduction and death. Also recorded in this period was \"Alison\", a reinterpretation of Elvis Costello's original.\n\nFollowing 1993's Don't Smoke in Bed, the trio released a CD entirely of songs by Tom Waits, called Temptation. With this 1995 release, the \"Trio\" was dropped from the group's name.\n\nCole next went into a two-album flirtation with pop music, perhaps keeping with the \"diva\" fad of the late 90s. These albums, Dark Dear Heart (1997) and Romantically Helpless (2000) veered further from jazz by introducing pop elements to Cole's sound.\n\nIn 2001, she returned to the Christmas jazz roots of her first CD with Baby It's Cold Outside, which included such should-be classics as \"Christmas Time is Here\" (from A Charlie Brown Christmas), \"Santa Baby\", and the title track. Swapping cold for hot, she moved to a Summer theme in 2003's Shade, this time reinterpreting Cole Porter (\"Too Darn Hot\"), Irving Berlin (\"Heatwave\"), and The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson (\"God Only Knows\").\n\nCole's latest album, Holly Cole (originally entitled This House Is Haunted) was released in Canada in March 2007. It was released in the US in January 2008 and was followed by a US tour.\n\nCole tours frequently, particularly around the holiday season, in Canada.

Women are and have a right to be sexual beings. The video is silly, hedonistic and really fun. There is no shame in sexuality, there is no shame in fun. But remember; consent is key. Proms are synonymous with coming of age, a necessary social before graduation. We threw an irl (in real life) prom at our recent London show to announce our album and the night ended with much of the cast from the video making out and dancing with us on stage. Prom in many ways represents us coming of age as a band and we\u2019re hoping to usher in this new era; dancing, making out, making things with our friends and flipping the script every step of the way.\u201d</em><p>Renowned for their ferocious live show, the band are also excited to announce a UK and European tour,\u00a0which includes a date for The Workman\u2019s Club, Dublin on 25<sup>th</sup>\u00a0March 2018.<p><strong>Dream Wife</strong>\u00a0are: Rakel Mj\u00f6ll (lead vocals), Alice Go (guitar and vocals) and Bella Podpadec (bass and vocals).<p><strong><em>\u00a0</em></strong><p><strong><em>Dream Wife</em></strong>\u00a0will be released on\u00a0<strong>January 26th, 2018\u00a0</strong>via\u00a0<strong>Lucky Number</strong>.\u00a0Pre-order on Vinyl/CD\u00a0<a href=\"https://dreamwife.tmstor.es/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>here</strong></a>\u00a0or Digitally\u00a0<a href=\"http://hyperurl.co/LetsMakeOut\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>here</strong></a>.<p><a href=\"http://www.dreamwife.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.dreamwife.co</a><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dreamwifedream\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.facebook.com/dreamwifedream</a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dreamwifetheband/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.instagram.com/dreamwifetheband/</a><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dreamwifemusic\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://twitter.com/dreamwifemusic</a></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></strong></strong></p>", "img": null, "title": "Aiken Promotions present DREAM WIFE", "url": "http://dublin.eventful.com/events/aiken-promotions-present-dream-wife-/E0-001-109078926-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "Ireland", "venue": "Dublin", "city": "Dublin"}, {"date": "2018-03-07 00:00:00", "description": " <p><em><strong>Voor liefhebbers van: Bikini Kill, Black Honey, Blondie</strong> </em><p>Met scherpe popsongs, een punk attitude en wilde liveshows is <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dreamwifedream/\" rel=\"noopener\" rel=\"noopener\" rel=\"noopener\" rel=\"noopener\">Dream Wife</a> je nieuwe favoriete garagepunkband.

This song details the life of a soldier after he becomes a decerebrated paraplegic. During his time in the hospital, he reflects on his life and things his father told him. The doctors become worried because he does not die. \n\nThe lyrics are based on the novel \"Johnny Got His Gun\" by Dalton Trumbo, an anti-war novel about World War I. A specific passage that inspired the song is: \"How could a man lose as much of himself as I have and still live? When a man buys a lottery ticket you never expect him to win because it's a million to one shot. But if he does win, you'll believe it because one in a million still leaves one. If I'd read about a guy like me in the paper I wouldn't believe it, cos it's a million to one. But a million to ONE always leaves one. I'd never expect it to happen to me because the odds of it happening are a million to one. But a million to one always leaves one. One.\"\n\nIn 1971, \"Johnny Got His Gun\" was made into a film which was directed by Trumbo. Metallica bought the rights to movie after attempts to use images from the movie in the music video, the first in Metallica's career. The video uses images and monologues from the movie.\n\n The song was released in 1989 as the second single taken from the album (the first being \"Harvester of Sorrow\"). It became the band's first Top 40 single in the United States, peaking at #35 on the Billboard Hot 100, achieving this with absolutely no pop radio airplay - American pop stations refused to play a seven and a half minute long thrash metal song - but mostly on the band of rock radio airplay and the fact that the physical 7'' single had gone sold over 50,000 copies at that point.\n\nFor the first 20 seconds of the song there is a series of sound effects with a battle theme; an artillery barrage is heard and continues slightly over a clean tone guitar intro by Hetfield before Kirk Hammett comes in over the top with a clean-toned solo. The song speeds up after Ulrich's drums come in and continues until each chorus, when the guitars become heavy and distorted before returning to clean. There is a second solo by Hammett halfway through the song, before lyrics cut out and the song gradually gets more heavy and distorted until the \"machine gun\" guitar build up (played alongside two bass drums) before the final, often highly praised, guitar solo by Hammett, and a final dual solo by Hammett and Hetfield.\n\n\"One\"'s opening A-G modulation was written by Hetfield based on an idea prompted by the song \"Buried Alive\" by the band Venom.\n\u201c \tI had been fiddling around with that A-G modulation for a long time. The idea for the opening came from a Venom song called \"Buried Alive\". The kick drum machine-gun part near the end wasn't written with the war lyrics in mind, it just came out that way. We started that album with Mike Clink as producer. He didn't work out so well, so we got Flemming to come over and save our asses.\u201d\n- James Hetfield, Guitar World 1991\n\nThis song is featured on Guitar Hero 3.\n\nThis was the first single released by the band to feature bassist Jason Newsted. He continued playing with Metallica until 2001.\n\nMetallica performed the song at the Grammy awards in 1989. This was the first year a Grammy was awarded for Hard Rock/Metal Performance, and in a storm of controversy, the Grammy went to Jethro Tull. This was considered a slap in the face to metal and further evidence that the Grammys had become culturally ignorant as the album Jethro Tull was nominated for, Crest of a Knave, could hardly be considered hard rock or heavy metal. In 1991, this slight was avenged when the song won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance.\n\nThis was included on the 1999 live album S&M, which they recorded with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.\n\nKoRn performed this on MTV Icon in 2003.\n\nThe name of the statue with the scales on the album cover is \"Doris\".\n\nHetfield has said he lifted the intro from Venom's \"Buried Alive,\" a song about being trapped in a casket while being buried alive, similar to the predicament of the character in this song.\n\nHammett told Kerrang! September 13, 2008 that this track has one of his favorite Metallica guitar solos. He explained: \"Specifically, this is the middle solo of the song. Much like 'Enter Sandman' it's a solo that everybody can pretty much sing along to, and it definitely gives me a really good feeling every time I play it.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/_/One\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was released as the album's fifth single in mid-1992. It is one of Metallica's first attempts at tuning down guitars, in this case, tuning down to D standard. They would use this tuning later on their cover of \"Whiskey in the Jar\" from Garage Inc., and would utilize drop C tuning (D standard with the bottom string tuned another full step) on St. Anger. In 2004, Guitar Player listed James Hetfield's tone, most likely produced by an ESP guitar driving a Mesa Boogie amplifier as one of the \"50 Greatest Tones of All Time.\"[1]\n\nThe lyrical theme of this song is dissociative identity disorder and schizophrenia, inspired by the 1978 Anthony Hopkins film Magic. James Hetfield sings from the point of view of an evil personality.[citation needed]\n\n\"Sad but True\" is one of six singles from Metallica. The song was included on Metallica's live collaboration with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra (conducted by Michael Kamen), entitled S&M, as well as their 1993 box set Live Shit: Binge & Purge. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/_/Sad+but+True\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In live concerts, the beginning is not played by the band but instead the actual recording is used (recently dropped 1/2 step in key, since the band tunes 1/2 step down).\n\nIn keeping with the general \"control\" theme of Master of Puppets, the lyrics of \"Battery\" discuss the control that anger can have over one's behavior. The title refers to \"battery\" in the sense of \"assault and battery\", as shown by these lyrics: \"Smashing through the boundaries / Lunacy has found me / Cannot stop the battery\".\n\n\"Battery\" is still an almost constant part of the band's live set list, frequently as the opening or closing song. In some cases, it is also used as a song before the intermission. When played, the song may stop before the interlude, and James Hetfield asks the crowd \"Are you alive?... How does it feel to be alive?\" and followed by the solo played by Kirk Hammett. During the chorus of the original version, bassist Cliff Burton can be heard roaring the backing vocals each time Hetfield says the title.\n\nIn the live version of the song played on the Live Shit: Binge & Purge album, intros to the songs \"No Remorse\", \"Ride the Lightning\", and \"So What?\" are played in the song. When performed with the San Francisco Symphony in 1999, the intro up to the thrash riff was instead played by string players in the symphony, utilizing pizzicato in the beginning (the original acoustic) then with bows for the rest.\n\n\"Battery\" will be featured in the upcoming music game Rock Band 2. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/_/Battery\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It stems from the thrill of fast driving and street racing. The song could also be applied to the fact that people like to drive their lives (like their cars) too fast. It seems to be one of James Hetfield's favorite songs as he later said before a concert played at an Oakland Raiders game, \"We have to play Fuel...'cause it gets me pumped up.\" (taped on Some Kind of Monster)\n\nAnother interpretation of this song, which reflects the external struggles of the band members themselves as well as the personal lyric style James Hetfield adopted beginning with The Black Album, suggests that the song is about addiction. Specifically the addiction may be Hetfield's alcoholism, but it could be a reference to any sort of addiction. It is a reference to whatever it may be that fuels a person. Further, it may reflect Hetfield's decision to substitute his love of cars and racing for his love of alcohol.\n\nThe song was written by Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, and Kirk Hammett, and was the third single from the album. Metallica played the song before the relase on the Convert-DVD 'Cunning Stunts', but with a different text, they have frequently played the song in concert over the years, including the 1999 live album S&M with Michael Kamen conducting the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. In 2003, Avril Lavigne performed a live cover of 'Fuel' on the Metallica edition of the tribute show, MTV Icon. Lavigne's version appeared on the bonus CD included with the limited edition of her DVD My World. Iron Horse covered the song as well. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/_/Fuel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was first performed live in a \"jam\" version on July 2, 1996.[1] The song is about a once-great, now forgotten celebrity who is desperate to regain her fame but is driven half-mad with her obscurity. It may be a reference to the film Sunset Boulevard. The line \"ash to ash, dust to dust, fade to black,\" is probably an indirect reference to one of their earlier songs, \"Fade to Black\".\n\nThe song was the first single from the album. It was written by James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich.\n\nThe song was performed, with Marianne Faithfull, on the December 6, 1997 edition of Saturday Night Live when Metallica was the musical guest. A live version of the song was released as b-side to the single The Unforgiven II. It was later performed with the San Francisco Symphony (conducted by Michael Kamen) on S&M. Another live version was included on Orgullo, Pasi\u00f3n y Gloria. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/_/The+Memory+Remains\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The lyrics and song material were inspired by Hetfield's anguish on the circumstances surrounding his mother's death. She died of cancer after refusing medical attention, solely relying on her belief in God to heal her. Hetfield felt that had she not followed her Christian Science beliefs, she could have survived. Hetfield does not celebrate God's failure in the song, but instead blames God, through his mother's faith and death, for contributing to the meaninglessness of life.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/_/The+God+That+Failed\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Metallica\u2019s line-up originally consisted of Ulrich, rhythm guitarist and vocalist James Hetfield, and lead guitarist Dave Mustaine. Mustaine was later fired due to problems with alcoholism and drug addiction - he went on to form the band Megadeth. Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett took his place. Metallica has been through several bassists, including Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton (who died in a bus crash while the band was on tour), and Jason Newsted. The current bassist is Robert Trujillo, who joined in 2003.\n\nMetallica\u2019s early releases included fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship that placed them as one of the \u201cbig four\u201d of the thrash metal sub-genre alongside Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax. The band earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and critical acclaim, with the 1986 release Master of Puppets described as one of the most influential and \u201cheavy\u201d metal albums. The band achieved substantial commercial success with Metallica (1991), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. With this release the band expanded its musical direction resulting in an album that appealed to a more mainstream audience.\n\nIn 2000, Metallica was among several artists who filed a lawsuit against Napster for sharing the band\u2019s copyright-protected material for free without the band members\u2019 consent. A settlement was reached, and Napster became a pay-to-use service. Despite reaching number one on the Billboard 200, the release of St. Anger alienated many fans with the exclusion of guitar solos and the \u201csteel-sounding\u201d snare drum. A film titled Some Kind of Monster documented the recording process of St. Anger.\n\nMetallica has released nine studio albums, two live albums, two EPs, twenty-two music videos, and forty-four singles. The band has won nine Grammy Awards, and has had five consecutive albums debut at number one on the Billboard 200, making Metallica the only band ever to do so. The band\u2019s 1991 album, Metallica, has sold over 15 million copies in the United States, and 22 million copies worldwide, which makes it the 25th-highest-selling album in the country. The band has sold an estimated 100 million records worldwide as of the release of their latest album Death Magnetic. As of September 2008, Metallica is the fourth highest-selling music artist since the SoundScan era began tracking sales on May 25, 1991, selling a total of 51,136,000 albums in the United States alone.\n\nMetallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2009. Metallica organised a brand new festival. They called it Sonishpere. Several cities in Europe were chosen by the band.\n\nOn June 15, 2011, Metallica announced that recording sessions with singer-songwriter Lou Reed had concluded. The album, titled Lulu, was recorded over several months, and resulted in ten songs based on Frank Wedekind's \"Lulu\" plays, Earth Spirit and Pandora's Box. The album was released on October 31, 2011. The recording of the album was problematic at times, with Lars Ulrich later stating Lou Reed challenged him to a \"street fight\". On October 16, 2011, Robert Trujillo confirmed that the band was back in the studio and writing new material, stating, \"The writing process for the new Metallica album has begun. We've been in the studio with Rick Rubin, working on a couple of things, and we're going to be recording during the most of next year.\"\n\nCurrent members:\n\nJames Hetfield \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitar (1981\u2013present)\nLars Ulrich  \u2013 drums, percussion (1981\u2013present)\nKirk Hammett  \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals (1983\u2013present)\nRobert Trujillo \u2013 bass, backing vocals (2003\u2013present).\n\nFormer members:\n\nRon McGovney\u2013 bass (1982)\nDave Mustaine \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals (1982\u20131983)\nCliff Burton \u2013 bass, backing vocals (1982\u20131986)\nJason Newsted \u2013 bass, backing vocals (1986\u20132001). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Metallica\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

This version won a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording in 2009.\n\n\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" features a robotic vocal performance by Daft Punk. As documented in the Discovery liner notes, \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" contains a sample of \"Cola Bottle Baby\" by Edwin Birdsong.\n\nA live version of \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" was recorded at Bercy in Paris from 14 June 2007. It was released as a digital download single on 15 October 2007, for the live album Alive 2007. The track contains a part of the \"Television Rules the Nation / Crescendolls\" segment of the Bercy performance that features elements of the songs \"Around the World\", \"Steam Machine\", \"Television Rules the Nation\".  This version of the song won the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording at the 51st Grammy Awards.\n\nKanye West's song \"Stronger\" from the album Graduation prominently features a sample of \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\". Two actors who wore the robotic Daft Punk costumes in the film Daft Punk's Electroma appear in the music video for \"Stronger\". It was later performed live at the 2008 Grammy Awards with Daft Punk in their trademark pyramid while West was on stage rapping. Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo clarified that \"Stronger\" was \"not a collaboration in the studio, but the vibe of the music we do separately connected in what [West] did with the song.\" He later specified that the live version was \"truly a collaboration from the start.

The song's vocal performance by Romanthony is heavily auto-tuned and compressed. As part of the album, the track is featured in the introduction to the film Interstella 5555. \"One More Time\" remained their biggest commercial hit until 2013's get lucky. It nearly topped the United Kingdom chart in 2000, instead peaking at #2, and was one of their few charting songs in the United States, reaching #61 on the Billboard Hot 100. It is also featured in the Wii video game Boogie and PlayStation 3's SingStar. Marc Mysterio released a cover version of \"One More Time\" featuring the vocals of Yardi Don. The song is currently Daft Punk's only #1 single in their home country of France.\n\nThe song is listed at #5 on Pitchfork Media's top 500 songs of the 2000s, and #33 on RollingStone's top 100 songs of the decade (2000\u20132009).\n\n\"One More Time\" prominently features a vocal performance written and sung by Romanthony. As stated by Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, \"we thought the funkiness of his voice fit the funkiness of the music.\" The song's vocal features heavy processing and auto-tuning. When questioned on the effects, Thomas Bangalter stated \"A lot of people complain about musicians using Auto-Tune. It reminds me of the late '70s when musicians in France tried to ban the synthesizer... What they didn't see was that you could use those tools in a new way instead of just for replacing the instruments that came before.\" According to Bangalter, Romanthony enjoyed the alterations to his vocal on the track. \"He has done a lot of different things and he always tries to innovate, which is what we like to do on our records. He never had his voice treated like an instrument like that.\" He also elaborated:\n\n\u201c We care less now than we used to about what critics say about our music. We liked the track, Romanthony liked it, we can be disappointed about what they said about the song, but still we liked it. It\u2019s just music, it\u2019s just entertainment, and as long as we believe in it that\u2019s what is important. It\u2019s what we wanted to do. We love to be able to use instruments the way we want to. Criticizing the Vocoder is like asking bands in the \u201960s, \u2018Why do you use the electric guitar?\u2019 It\u2019s just a tool... no big deal. Creation is interaction. The healthy thing is that people either loved it or hated it. At least people were not neutral. The worst thing when you make art is for people to not even be moved by it. Love and hate are interesting because it\u2019s deep and intense. It\u2019s one side of our music that people might be sensitive to and others might not.\u201d \n\nThe single contains an eight-minute version of \"One More Time\" featuring extended vocals absent from the album version. An \"unplugged\" version was also released in the remix album Daft Club. The remix album also contains a remix of \"Aerodynamic\" by Daft Punk featuring elements of \"One More Time\". The \"short radio edit\" of \"One More Time\" from the single was later included in the compilation album Musique Vol. 1 1993\u20132005.

It appeared on the duo's debut album, Homework and was released as a single the same year. It subsequently became a major club hit throughout the world and arrived at #1 in dance charts. The song is particularly known for the repeated phrasing of its title. It is also known for its music video, which was directed by Michel Gondry and choreographed by Blanca Li.\n\nThe key hook is a steady bassline and a vocoder-processed voice singing \"around the world\" in continuous chains. The phrase occurs 144 times in the album version and 80 times in the radio edit.\n\nUpon analysis of the song, Michel Gondry noted its distinctive structure: \"I realized how genius and simple the music was. Only five different instruments, with very few patterns, each to create numerous possibilities of figures. Always using the repetition, and stopping just before it's too much.\" He also noted the similarity between the bassline of \"Around the World\" and that of the Chic song \"Good Times\".\n\nA cover version of \"Around the World\" was released in 2006 as \"Around the World Again\" by Nicky Van She and Dangerous Dan. A remix of the will.i.am song \"I Got It from My Mama\" included a sample from \"Around the World.\" Daft Punk failed to approve use of the sample and refused will.i.am permission to release the remix. A music video was produced with the sample included, however. A song titled \"Around the World\" was released by rapper P.M. that contains a sample of \"Around the World\". Se\u00f1or Coconut released a cover of \"Around the World\" on his 2008 album, Atom\u2122 presents: Around the World with Se\u00f1or Coconut and his Orchestra. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Daft+Punk/_/Around+the+World\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The track was released on March 28, 2001 as the second single from the Discovery album.\n\nGuy-Manuel de Homem-Christo once described the Discovery album as \"A mix between the past and the future, maybe the present.\" Thomas Bangalter also elaborated in a 2001 interview that \"A lot of house music today just uses samples from disco records of the '70s and '80s... While we might have some disco influences, we decided to go further and bring in all the elements of music that we liked as children, whether it's disco, electro, heavy metal, rock, or classical.\"\n\nThis is reflected in the structure of \"Aerodynamic\", which is said to build up a funk groove, halt for a solo consisting of \"metallic, two-hand tapping on electric guitar\", combining the two styles and ending with a separate \"spacier\" electronic segment. The solo elements were described playfully as \"impossible, ridiculous Yngwie guitar arpeggios\", which reflect the fast arpeggiation common with violin parts in classical music. Bangalter acknowledged that \"Some people might think that the guitar solos on 'Aerodynamic' are in bad taste, but for us, it's all about being true to ourselves and not caring what other people would think. We really tried to include most of the things we liked as kids, and bring that sense of fun to it.\"\n\nThe \"Aerodynamic\" single contained a B-side remix titled \"Aerodynamite\". Another remix of \"Aerodynamic\" features Detroit-based hip hop group Slum Village. The creation of the Slum Village remix resulted after Slum Village used an uncredited sample of Thomas Bangalter's \"Extra Dry\" in their song \"Raise It Up\". Instead of asking for compensation for using the sample, Pedro Winter suggested to Daft Punk that they ask Slum Village to remix one of their tracks.\n\nBoth \"Aerodynamite\" and the Slum Village remix were later included in the album Daft Club, which contains an additional remix by Daft Punk featuring elements of \"One More Time\". A live version of \"Aerodynamic\" coupled with \"One More Time\" is featured in the album Alive 2007. \"Aerodynamic\" was later sampled for the Wiley song \"Summertime\" from the album See Clear Now. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Daft+Punk/_/Aerodynamic\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

As part of the album, the song is featured in the film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem.\n\nAs documented in the Discovery liner notes, the song features a sample of \"I Love You More\" by George Duke. The sample was worked into an electronic pop song about unspoken love with lyrics by DJ Sneak and vocals performed by Daft Punk.\n\nThe track is known for the guitar solo featured prominently on its second half. Thomas Bangalter revealed that the solo was created using a mixture of elements, aided by music sequencers. \"No one plays solos in their songs anymore, but we wanted to include some on the album.\" Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo also noted the duo's use of in-studio equipment to evoke the sound of a previous artist:\n\n\u201c On 'Digital Love,' you get this Supertramp vibe on the bridge. We didn't sample Supertramp, but we had the original Wurlitzer piano they used, so we thought it would be more fun to have the original instrument and mess around with it. We use mainly vintage synthesizers, like older electric pianos like the Rhodes, Wurlitzer, Clavinet. We didn't use the Clavinet on Discovery, but I usually use it in my studio.\u201d \n\nThe band Hellogoodbye often uses the first two verses of \"Digital Love\" in place of the second verse of the song \"Here (In Your Arms)\" when performing live.

It\u2019s a born entertainer, complete, who transpires elegance. He didn\u2019t always have the chance to show off his singing skills, and boy he can sing. We wanted to give the impression of being trapped in a glass bubble, completely isolated from the outside world. We could of been in 1978, but the idea was to get the music to travel the present time and also the future. See what happens and observe how this enthusiasm communicates with people.\u201d \u2014Daft Punk\n\n\n\"Get Lucky\" is a song by French house music duo Daft Punk, co-written by and featuring Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers. It is the lead single from Daft Punk's fourth studio album Random Access Memories. Before its release as a single, \"Get Lucky\" was featured in television advertisements broadcast during Saturday Night Live, after which Rodgers and Pharrell announced their involvement in the track. Small excerpts also appear throughout the promotional video series The Collaborators.\nMusically, \"Get Lucky\" is a disco and funk song while lyrically, according to Pharrell Williams, the song is about the fortune of finding chemistry with someone and not just about sexual chemistry. Following a leak days earlier, the single was released as a digital download on 19 April 2013. \"Get Lucky\" has since received acclaim from critics and was commercially successful, reaching the top ten in the music charts of over 28 countries.\n\n\"Get Lucky\" was completed over the course of approximately 18 months. Daft Punk first met Nile Rodgers at a listening party in New York for the duo's 1997 debut album Homework, and became friends thereafter. The duo acknowledged Chic's influence in the song \"Around the World\" and had great respect for Rodgers. He noted however that a series of near misses and scheduling conflicts had delayed their chance of collaborating. The duo eventually invited Rodgers to the Random Access Memories sessions at Electric Lady Studios in New York City. This coincidentally was the studio where the first Chic single had been recorded, in the neighborhood in which Rodgers grew up. Prior to Rodgers' involvement, the song existed in rough form that centered on Wurlitzer electric piano with Omar Hakim on drums and Nathan East performing bass guitar. Once Rodgers contributed his rhythm guitar work, Daft Punk re-recorded the bass part with East to fit Rodgers' performance.\nPharrell Williams had first heard from Daft Punk about the project \"at a Madonna party\" they were attending, and offered his services for a collaboration. The duo and Pharrell later met up in Paris, where he showed some of his own material he had been working on. Pharrell explained that he had been inspired by Rodgers, not knowing that Daft Punk had coincidentally been recording with him. Pharrell noted that the duo took a perfectionist approach in recording the vocals, as he was asked to perform several takes and multiple instances of specific phrases. Upon returning to the United States, Pharrell had \"forgotten everything\" regarding the composition of \"Get Lucky\"; he attributed this to jet lag, but jokingly wondered if the duo had tampered with his memory. Daft Punk responded by explaining that Pharrell's lyrics and performance had come about in a very spontaneous way, which was the likely reason he had trouble recalling the song. Upon hearing \"Get Lucky\" later in developed form, Pharrell remarked that the music evoked the sense of being on an exotic island during a \"peachy color[ed]\" sunrise. He elaborated that the title does not simply refer to a sexual act, but to the fortune of meeting with and immediately connecting to someone. As a member of The Neptunes, Pharrell had previously provided a remix of \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" that appeared in the 2003 album Daft Club. Daft Punk had also served as co-writers and producers for the 2010 single \"Hypnotize U\" by N.E.R.D, Pharrell's band.\n\n\"Get Lucky\" was first publicly revealed via two 15-second television advertisements on Saturday Night Live. Rodgers announced his contribution to the song shortly afterward, and noted that various fan remixes of the clips have appeared online since the airing. The third trailer, which was shown at the Coachella Festival, officially announced Pharrell's involvement in the song and features Daft Punk, Rodgers, and Pharrell performing together. The promotional web series The Collaborators featured excerpts of \"Get Lucky\", culminating in the Pharrell-focused episode in which the song was first referred to by name. Days prior to the single release, the song had been leaked and broadcasted on various radio stations. In the United Kingdom the song joined the playlists of BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2 and BBC Radio 6 Music. Upon the official release, Pharrell performed \"Get Lucky\" live for the first time at an HTC One launch party in Brooklyn. British band Daughter recorded an indie version of the song for BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. The song was also covered by George Barnett, Postmen, Igor Presnyakov, The Stepkids and Sam Sparro. Peter Serafinowicz uploaded a video of him featuring the song.[22] Israeli musician Noy Alooshe made a mashup of the song with Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean\".[19] Australian band San Cisco recorded a cover version for the radio station Triple J, incorporating slap bass and bongo drums as well as elements of the N.E.R.D song \"Hypnotize U\". A 12\" Vinyl single is expected to be released on July 16, 2013, featuring a remix by Daft Punk, the album version and the radio edit.\n\nIn France, \"Get Lucky\" debuted at number one on the French Singles Chart on 24 April 2013, becoming the duo's first chart-topping single in their home country since \"One More Time\". The song sold 38,887 copies in three days, making \"Get Lucky\" the best-selling digital single in a one-week period. In Belgium, where two independent official charts are published weekly (one for Flanders, one for Wallonia), \"Get Lucky\" entered in the top position on both charts, making it Daft Punk's highest Belgian chart entry ever and their first No. 1 song in the country.\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Get Lucky\" entered the UK Singles Chart at No. 3 on 21 April 2013\u2015 only 48 hours after its release\u2014selling more than 50,000 copies; the song became Daft Punk's first top ten hit in the country since \"One More Time\" in 2000. The song then peaked at No. 1 the following week, with sales of over 155,000 copies, and became Daft Punk's first ever No. 1 single in Britain. The song remained in the top position during the following week and sales reached 163,000. \"Get Lucky\" remained atop the chart for a fourth consecutive week and once again sold over 100,000 copies; as of 19 May 2013, over 600,000 copies of the song were sold in just over four weeks. According to a report from the Official Charts Company on 22 May 2013, sales of \"Get Lucky\" are higher than those of Macklemore and Ryan Lewis' \"Thrift Shop\", making it the country's best-selling single of the year thus far.\nIn the United States, the song debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Songs chart for the week ending 4 May 2013. By the week ending 25 May, the song had reached the No. 2 position and its peak position of No. 1 was eventually reached during the week ending 1 June 2013. The song debuted at No. 19 on the Billboard Hot 100 on the 24 April 2013, selling 113,000 downloads\u2014this placement resulted in the song becoming the duo's first ever top 40 hit on the chart. On the 30 May, the song climbed to No. 4 on the chart, making it the biggest hit Williams has been involved with since the 2006 No. 1 hit \"Money Maker\" that was recorded with Ludacris. As of 5 June 2013 \"Get Lucky\" has peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Get Lucky\" also reached the No. 1 position on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart, their first song to achieve this feat since \"Face to Face\" in 2004. By May 2013, 350,000 downloads of the song had been sold in the US. As of 12 June 2013, the song has sold 1,030,000 units, the second most by any Daft Punk song, behind only their hit \"One More Time\".\nIn Australia, \"Get Lucky\" debuted at No. 2 on the ARIA Singles Chart on the week ending 5 May 2013. The song is Daft Punk's highest-placing entry on the chart since \"One More Time\" peaked at No. 10 in April 2001. The song attained the top position on the ARIA chart in the second week after its release. The song dropped back down to No. 2 on the week ending 19 May and remained at the position for two extra weeks.\n\nSince its release, \"Get Lucky\" has received acclaim from media outlets and music critics. Michael Cragg from The Guardian said the song \"eschews the crunching electronics of their last album and the vocoder-lead [sic] future-disco of Discovery\", and it was the \"best thing Pharrell Williams has been involved with for a long time\". Pitchfork listed \"Get Lucky\" as a Best New Track, stating that the song's \"real elegance lies in the hands of Nile Rodgers\". Lewis Corner from Digital Spy gave the single 5 stars and said although Daft Punk's \"creative methods may be unorthodox, the final result is a legal rush we can all enjoy\". BBC Radio 1 host Annie Mac played \"Get Lucky\" on the day of its release, and gave it a positive review. She remarked that Daft Punk are not making electronic dance music, but rather \"real music to dance to\". Music critic Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker wrote that Rodgers' performance in the song was \"as close to magic as pop comes.\" Rolling Stone reviewer Will Hermes giving the song a four-star rating out of five, described it as \"an old-school disco jam\" and called it \"formidable\". Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush also welcomed the song, she called it an \"intoxicating track\" and wrote it \"represents all that\u2019s right with electronic music.\"\nThe song broke records with the highest number of plays of any song in a single day on music streaming application Spotify. British journalist Caitlin Moran has speculated that the song's attractiveness is due to its combination of minor chords and regular disco-type \"up\" beats throughout the song, with the former creating an unresolved feeling.\nFellow musicians have also publicly commented on the song. British DJ and producer Norman Cook (better known as \"Fatboy Slim\") expressed high praise for the song and stated in an interview with the Daily Star: \"I'm so impressed by them.

The music video for \"Technologic\" was directed by Daft Punk.\n\nThe song was featured in an iPod advertisement shown in the summer of 2005. It was also featured in an ad for the Motorola E398 mobile-phone, aired in early 2005 in Brazil. Additionally, the song was featured in an episode of The O.C.. Recently it is used in the 2009 Lincoln MKS commercial, and in a series of TV ads for the Alfa Romeo MiTo. It is a playable track on the iPhone OS games Tap Tap Revenge and Tap Tap Dance. In an episode of the tv-show America's Best Dance Crew, crew Kaba Modern performed to a master-mix of this song on February 7, 2008.\n\nThe song features an electronically transposed voice chanting technological commands. For example, \"Plug it, play it, burn it, rip it, drag and drop it, zip, unzip it\" are spoken in rhythm to a beat.\n\nA portion of the vocals were altered and used in the Busta Rhymes single \"Touch It\", produced by Swizz Beatz. In a remix of \"Touch It\" the lines touch it, bring it, pay it, watch it, turn it, leave it, start, format it were sung by rap artist Missy Elliott. Additionally, the music video for \"Touch It\" shows a group of young cheerleaders doing a routine while chanting the same line.\n\nElements of both \"Technologic\" and \"Touch It\" are featured in Daft Punk's live album Alive 2007. The repeated line \"**** it\" (a combination of fill and lock it) was also integrated in the Alive 2007 tour, beginning in Daft Punk's live show at Bercy in Paris. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Daft+Punk/_/Technologic\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is the lead single off of Daft Punk's fourth studio album Random Access Memories. Pharrell said that the song was not about a sexual conquest, but the fortune in finding potential chemistry with someone. Before its release as a single, \"Get Lucky\" was featured in television advertisements broadcast during Saturday Night Live, after which Rodgers announced his involvement in the track. \n\nDaft Punk first met Nile Rodgers at a listening party in New York for the 2001 album Discovery, and became friends thereafter. The duo acknowledged Chic's influence in the song \"Around the World\" and had great respect for Rodgers. He noted however that a series of near misses and scheduling conflicts had delayed their chance of collaborating. The duo eventually invited Rodgers to the Random Access Memories sessions at Electric Lady Studios in New York City, which coincidentally was the studio where the first Chic single had been recorded.\n\nPharrell Williams had first heard from Daft Punk about the project \"at a Madonna party\" they were attending, and offered his services for a collaboration. The duo and Pharrell later met up in Paris, where he showed some of his own material he had been working on. Pharrell explained that he had been inspired by Rodgers, not knowing that Daft Punk had coincidentally been recording with him. Upon hearing \"Get Lucky\", Pharrell remarked that the music evoked the sense of being on an exotic island during a \"peachy color[ed]\" sunrise. He elaborated that the title does not simply refer to a sexual act, but to the fortune of meeting with and immediately connecting to someone.\n\n\"Get Lucky\" was first publicly revealed via two 15-second television advertisements on Saturday Night Live. Rodgers announced his contribution to the song shortly afterward, and noted that various fan remixes of the clips have appeared online since the airing. The third trailer officially announced Pharrell's involvement in the song and features Daft Punk, Rodgers, and Pharrell performing together. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Daft+Punk/_/Get+Lucky+(Radio+Edit)+%5Bfeat.+Pharrell+Williams%5D\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Whilst the single reached a moderately high chart position, many critics found the song overly repetitive. It prominently features sampled portions of \"Release the Beast\" performed by Breakwater.\n\n\"Robot Rock\" is based around a sample from the Breakwater song \"Release the Beast\", which features a riff played on an oscillator sync patch on an analog synthesizer. In addition, Daft Punk incorporated other elements of the \"Release the Beast\" into the production, including percussion and power chords on an electric guitar. A talk box vocal phrase featuring the title of Daft Punk's single was also added to the recording. The Breakwater sample is credited on the single's sleeve and on the liner notes of the parent Human After All album. This was not the first time Daft Punk have sampled a song to create a new recording, as \"Digital Love\" would be a noted example.\n\nThe Breakwater sample is absent from the \"Maximum Overdrive\" remix of \"Robot Rock\", which consists of the song's other elements for a duration of nearly six minutes.

The band is considered one of the most successful electronic music collaborations of all time, both in album sales and in critical acclaim. \n\nDaft Punk reached significant popularity in the late 90s house movement in France, along with other artists such as Air, Cassius, and Dimitri From Paris. Daft Punk are credited with producing songs that were considered essential in the French house scene. They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter (Busy P), the head of Ed Banger Records.\n\nThe group released four studio albums: Homework (1997), Discovery (2001), Human After All (2005), and Random Access Memories (2013). They also released the soundtrack album TRON: Legacy (2010); the live albums Alive 1997 (2002), Alive 2007 (2007); the compilation Musique Vol. 1 1993\u20132005 (2006); the remix albums Daft Club (2003), Human After All: Remixes (2006), TRON: Legacy Reconfigured (2011).\n\n\nEarly years (1987\u20131993)\n\nThomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo met in 1987 on the grounds of the Lyc\u00e9e Carnot, a secondary school in Paris. The two became good friends and later recorded demo tracks with others from the school. This eventually led to the formation of the guitar-based group Darlin' with Laurent Brancowitz in 1992. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo played bass and guitar, respectively, while Brancowitz performed on drums. The trio had branded themselves after The Beach Boys song of the same name, which they covered along with an original composition. \n\nStereolab released both tracks on a multi-artist Duophonic Records EP and invited the band to open for stage shows in the United Kingdom. Bangalter felt that \"The rock n' roll thing we did was pretty average, I think. It was so brief, maybe six months, four songs and two gigs and that was it.\" A negative review in Melody Maker subsequently dubbed the music \"a bunch of daft punk.\" Instead of dismissing the review, Bangalter and de Homem-Christo found it to be amusing. As the latter stated, \"We struggled so long to find [the name] Darlin', and this happened so quickly.\" Darlin' soon disbanded, leaving Brancowitz to pursue other efforts with Phoenix. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk and experimented with drum machines and synthesizers.\n\n\nHomework era (1993\u20131999)\n\nIn 1993 Daft Punk attended a rave at EuroDisney, where they met Stuart Macmillan of Slam, co-founder of the label Soma Quality Recordings. The demo tape given to Macmillan at the rave formed the basis for Daft Punk's debut single, \"The New Wave\", a limited release in 1994. The single also contained the final mix of \"The New Wave\" called \"Alive\".\n\nDaft Punk returned to the studio in May 1995 to record \"Da Funk\". It became their first commercially successful single the same year. After the success of \"Da Funk\", Daft Punk looked to find a manager. They had no trouble finding one at the time as they chose Pedro Winter, who regularly promoted them and other artists at his Hype night clubs. The band signed with Virgin Records in September 1996 and made a deal through which they licensed their tracks to the major label through their production company, Daft Trax.\n\n\"Da Funk\" and \"Alive\" were later included on Daft Punk's 1997 debut album Homework. The album was regarded as an innovative synthesis of techno, house, acid house and electro styles, and is widely acknowledged as one of the most influential dance music albums of the nineties. \"Da Funk\" was also included on The Saint film soundtrack. It was during this period of change in dance music that Daft Punk became largely successful. They combined the aforementioned music styles and elements of rave that were crowd pleasers. The most successful single from Homework was \"Around the World\", which is known for the repeating chant of the song's title.\n\nDaft Punk also produced a series of music videos for Homework directed by Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, Roman Coppola and Seb Janiak. The collection of videos was released in 1999 and titled D.A.F.T. - A Story about Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes.\n\n\nDiscovery era (1999\u20132004)\n\nBy 1999 the duo were well into the recording sessions for their second album, which had begun a year earlier. 2001's Discovery took on a slicker and distinctly synthpop-oriented style, initially stunning fans of Daft Punk's previous material in Homework. The group states that the album was conceived as an attempt to reconnect with a playful, open-minded attitude associated with the discovery phase of childhood. This accounts for the heavy use of themes and samples from the late '70s to early '80s era on the album.\n\nIt reached #2 in the United Kingdom, and its single \"One More Time\" was a major club hit, creating a new generation of fans mainly familiar with the second Daft Punk release. The singles \"Digital Love\" and \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" were also very successful in the UK and on the United States dance chart, and \"Face to Face\" hit #1 on the USA club play charts despite a limited single release. A 45-minute excerpt from a Daftendirektour performance recorded at Birmingham, UK in 1997 was also released in 2001, entitled Alive 1997.\n\n2003 first saw the release of the feature-length animated film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem. Daft Punk produced the film under the supervision of Leiji Matsumoto, whom they have said is their childhood hero. The album Daft Club was also released to promote the film. It features a collection of remixes previously made available through an online membership service of the same name.\n\n\nHuman After All era (2004\u2013present)\n\nStarting on September 13 and ending November 9, 2004, Daft Punk devoted six weeks to creating new material. The duo released the album Human After All in March 2005. Reviews were mixed, mostly citing its overly repetitive nature and seemingly rushed recording. The singles taken from this album were \"Robot Rock\", \"Technologic\", \"Human After All\" and \"The Prime Time of Your Life\". The earliest official statement from Daft Punk concerning the album was \"we believe that Human After All speaks for itself.\"\n\nA Daft Punk anthology CD/DVD entitled Musique Vol. 1 1993-2005 was released on 4 April 2006. It contains new music videos for \"The Prime Time of Your Life\" and \"Robot Rock (Maximum Overdrive)\". Daft Punk also released a remix album of Human After All called Human After All: Remixes. A limited edition included two kubricks of Daft Punk as robots.\n\nOn 21 May 2006, Daft Punk premiered their first directed film, Daft Punk's Electroma at the Cannes Film Festival sidebar Director's Fortnight. The film does not include their own music, which is a first for the duo considering their previous DVD and film releases (D.A.F.T. for Homework and Interstella 5555 for Discovery). Midnight screenings of the film were shown in Paris theaters starting from the end of March 2007.\n\nDaft Punk released their second live album titled Alive 2007 on 19 November 2007. It contains the duo's performance in Paris from their Alive 2007 tour. The album includes a 50-page book showcasing photographs shot while on tour. The live version of \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" from Alive 2007 was released as a single. A music video for the single directed by Olivier Gondry features footage shot by 250 audience members at Daft Punk's Brooklyn appearance at KeySpan Park, Coney Island. In 2007 Daft Punk also debuted in a worldwide official poll of DJ Magazine in position 71.\n\nFollowing the Alive 2007 tour, Daft Punk focused on other projects. A 2008 interview with Pedro Winter revealed that the duo returned to their Paris studio to work on new material. Winter also stepped down from managing Daft Punk to focus attention on his Ed Banger Records label and his work as Busy P. He stated in a later interview that the duo are working with an unspecified management company in Los Angeles.\n\n\nInfluences\n\nBangalter and de Homem-Christo have credited many sources that influenced their musical style. Years before producing electronic music as a duo, they were stated to have shared tastes for Elton John, MC5, The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys and The Stooges. Their mutual admiration for rock bands led to the founding of their own independent project, Darlin'. Bangalter expressed that \"It was still maybe more a teenage thing at that time. It's like, you know, everybody wants to be in a band.\"They drew inspiration from the rock and acid house displayed in the United Kingdom during the early 1990s. De Homem-Christo pointed to Screamadelica by Primal Scream as an influential work, as the record \"put everything together\" in terms of genre.\n\nThe liner notes of Homework pay tribute to a large number of musical artists and contains a quote from Brian Wilson. Bangalter expressed that \"In Brian Wilson's music you could really feel the beauty - it was very spiritual. Like Bob Marley, too.\" When questioned on the success of Daft Punk's debut album and rising popularity of their associated musical genre, Bangalter responded, \"before us you had Frankie Knuckles or Juan Atkins and so on. The least you can do is pay respect to those who are not known and who have influenced people.\" The Daft Punk track \"Teachers\" on Homework refers to several influences including Romanthony and Todd Edwards. De Homem-Christo stated that \"Their music had a big effect on us. The sound of their productions \u2014 the compression, the sound of the kick drum and Romanthony's voice, the emotion and soul \u2014 is part of how we sound today.\"\n\nRomanthony and Edwards later collaborated with Daft Punk in tracks for Discovery. For the album Daft Punk focused on new styles of electronic music. A major inspiration was the Aphex Twin single \"Windowlicker\", which was \"neither a purely club track nor a very chilled-out, down-tempo relaxation track\" according to Bangalter. The duo also utilized vintage equipment to recreate the sound of a previous artist. As stated by de Homem-Christo, \"On 'Digital Love' you get this Supertramp vibe on the bridge,\" which was generated through an in-studio Wurlitzer piano. During a later interview, de Homem-Christo clarified that \"we didn't make a list of artists we like and copy their songs.\"\n\n\nVisual components\n\nDaft Punk are noted for their use of visual components associated with their musical productions. The music videos for their singles from Homework featured memorable characters and placed emphasis on storytelling instead of musical performance. The album Discovery subsequently became the soundtrack to Interstella 5555.\n\nTheir outward personae have also changed over time. During their Homework years, the duo would usually wear masks to hide their appearance. When not wearing disguises, they occasionally preferred to be replaced by animation (as they appeared in The Work of Director Michel Gondry DVD) or have their faces digitally obscured for press kits. Very few photos of the duo's faces exist, including a blurry one found in the Homework liner notes.\n\nIn their more visible Discovery years, they have appeared as futuristic robots for publicity photo shoots, interviews, live shows and music videos. These suits, engineered by Tony Gardner and Alterian, Inc., sport complicated helmets capable of various LED effects and metallic finger gloves. Daft Punk introduced the costumes to many U.S. television viewers through an advertisement for a special presentation of their videos during Cartoon Network's Toonami block. Thomas Bangalter once stated, \"We did not choose to become robots. There was an accident in our studio. We were working on our sampler, and at exactly 9:09 a.m. on September 9, 1999, it exploded. When we regained consciousness, we discovered that we had become robots.\"\n\nDuring a video interview shot in Japan, Daft Punk stated that they donned their robot masks to easily merge the characteristics of humans and machines. However, Bangalter later admitted that the costumes were initially the result of shyness. \"But then it became exciting from the audiences' point of view. It's the idea of being an average guy with some kind of superpower.\" When asked on whether the duo expressed themselves differently within the robotic suits, Bangalter stated \"No, we don't need to. It's not about having inhibitions. It's more like an advanced version of glam, where it's definitely not you.\" With the release of Human After All, the musical duo's outfits became slightly less complicated by consisting of dark leather jumpsuits and simplified versions of the Discovery head gear. The jumpsuits were designed by Hedi Slimane.\n\nDuring the filming and promotion of Daft Punk's Electroma, the duo went to great lengths to avoid showing their faces. While on the set of the film, the duo chose to be interviewed with their backs turned. As reported on October 2006, the band went as far as to wear black cloth over their heads during a televised interview.\n\nIt is believed that the mystery of their identity and the elaborate nature of their disguises has added to their popularity. The iconic status of the robotic costumes has been compared to the makeup of KISS and the leather jacket worn by Iggy Pop. Bangalter stated, \"The mask gets very hot, but after wearing it as long as I have, I am used to it.\"\n\n\nLive performances\n\nIn the mid-to-late nineties, Daft Punk performed live without costumes in many places including the United States. In particular, a rare bootlegged video featuring the duo in Wisconsin matches the verified identity of Thomas Bangalter. Less clearly seen, Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo is to Bangalter's right and is mostly cut off from the camera. Comparing the artwork packaging of Homework to the video footage, one can verify that the album's liner note photo was taken during this event.\n\nIn the fall of 1997 they did their Daftendirektour to promote Homework in several cities throughout the world. For this tour Daft Punk opted to utilize their home studio equipment for the live stage instead of creating a more conventional DJ set. As Bangalter stated, \"Everything was synched up \u2014 the drum machines, the bass lines. The sequencer was just sending out the tempos and controlling the beats and bars. On top of this structure we built all these layers of samples and various parts that we could bring in whenever we wanted to.\" 25 May 1997 saw them perform at the Tribal Gathering festival at Luton Hoo, England, headlining with Orbital and Kraftwerk. Also of note is the November 8 performance in Birmingham, UK, from which came the recording of Alive 1997.\n\nAt the start of 2006, Daft Punk announced plans for a number of special summer shows. On 29 April Daft Punk performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival where they received a jubilant reception for their first U.S. performance since 1997. Thomas Bangalter had initially been reported as saying that there would be a DVD of their recent live set. He later emphasized his reluctance for such a release, as the duo felt that online amateur videos of their performances were more compelling than anything captured professionally. In an interview with the Miami Herald Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo stated that their November 11 appearance at the Bang Music Festival was their final for 2006 and that Daft Punk would conduct more performances in the future. The band later specified a date for a live show at Bercy, Paris for June 2007. Also reported were dates at the Rock Ness Festival and Wireless Festival in June, the Oxegen festival in July and Lollapalooza in August. Daft Punk then announced a world tour called Alive 2007.\n\nDaft Punk played at the Rock Ness Festival by the banks of Loch Ness, Scotland on 10 June 2007 as the headline act in the 10,000 capacity Clash tent. To the crowds displeasure, the show was delayed, but the crowd gave the duo a jubilant welcome when they appeared. Due to popularity, part of the tent was removed to allow thousands of people outside to see the show. On 16 June 2007 Daft Punk successfully headlined the third day of the O2 Wireless Festival to positive reaction and reviews. The Times described the set as a \"memorable sensory spectacle, both dazzling and deafening\" and ThisisLondon declared it \"an almost faultless set of relentless electro euphoria\".\n\nDaft Punk headlined Stage 2/NME Stage at the Oxegen music festival on 8 July 2007. Their live set was preceded by a showing of the trailer for the film Daft Punk's Electroma. Subsequent reports stated that the Daft Punk appearance was the highlight of the festival. NME expressed that the performance was \"a robotic spectacular\", while Shoutmouth described the set as \"typically triumphant\". Four days later, the duo played at Traffic Torino Free Festival in Parco della Pellerina in Turin, Italy.\n\nDaft Punk headlined the AT&T stage on 3 August 2007, the first night of the Lollapalooza music festival in Chicago. Their show there was praised by Pitchfork Media stating that the experience of watching the performance \"was a much-needed reminder of the still-potent power of communicative pop.\" On August 9 they performed at KeySpan Park in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nDaft Punk composed the music for the Louis Vuitton Spring/Summer 2008 Womenswear Full Show on 7 October 2007. The duo also headlined the Vegoose festival in Las Vegas on 27 October. They appeared at the festival along with bands Rage Against the Machine, Muse and Queens of the Stone Age. At the end of the month, Daft Punk performed in Mexico City. The duo also performed on Friday November 2, 2007 at the Arena Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico.\n\nModular announced that Daft Punk would appear in Australia for an event in December 2007 called Never Ever Land. The announcement addressed years of speculation on whether Daft Punk would visit Australia for live performances. Never Ever Land included Australian acts The Presets, Cut Copy, Muscles, Van She and the Bang Gang Deejays. Daft Punk were supported by their regular acts SebastiAn and Kavinsky at the appearances, which had been announced as an extension to the Alive 2007 tour. Never Ever Land toured to Melbourne at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl, Perth at the Esplanade, Brisbane at the Riverstage and finally Sydney at the Sydney Showground Main Arena. A Triple J interview with Pedro Winter (Busy P) revealed that Daft Punk's Sydney appearance on December 22 would be their final show for 2007 and the last to feature the pyramid light scheme. Tickets for the Australian tour sold more quickly than for any Daft Punk-related event in their history. The duo stated in an EMI-sponsored live webchat that there will be no tour performances for 2008, and that they would instead focus on new projects.\n\nDaft Punk made a surprise appearance at the 50th Grammy Awards on February 10, 2008. The duo appeared with Kanye West to perform a reworked version of \"Stronger\" on stage at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. For the appearance, Daft Punk utilized four JazzMutant Lemur controllers. A press release specified that this was the first televised live performance by the duo in their career. Bangalter's wife, \u00c9lodie Bouchez, also attended the event.\n\nFollowing the Alive 2007 tour, Daft Punk focused on other projects. A 2008 interview with Pedro Winter revealed that the duo returned to their Paris studio to work on new material. Winter also stepped down from managing Daft Punk to focus attention on his Ed Banger Records label and his work as Busy P. He stated in a later interview that the duo are working with an unspecified management company in Los Angeles. In 2008, Daft Punk placed 38th in a worldwide official poll of DJ Magazine after debuting at position 71 in the year before. On 8 February 2009, Daft Punk won Grammy Awards for Alive 2007 and its single \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\".\n\n\nDaft Punk in DJ Hero\nDaft Punk provided eleven new mixes featuring their music for the video game DJ Hero. They also appear in the game as playable characters, along with their own venue. The duo appear wearing their Discovery-era helmets and Human After All-era leather attire. Daft Punk's playable likenesses are absent from the sequel DJ Hero 2, which includes a remixed version of their song \"Human After All\".\n\nAt the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con, it was announced that the duo composed 24 tracks for the film Tron: Legacy. Daft Punk's score was arranged and orchestrated by Joseph Trapanese. The band collaborated with him for two years on the score, from pre-production to completion. The score features an 85-piece orchestra, recorded at AIR Lyndhurst Studios in London. Joseph Kosinski, director of the film, referred to the score as being a mixture of orchestral and electronic elements.\n\nDaft Punk also make a cameo appearance as disc jockey programs wearing their trademark robot masks within the film's virtual world. Tron: Legacy co-star Olivia Wilde stated that the duo may be involved with future promotional events related to the film. A teaser trailer features Daft Punk and their track \"Derezzed\" from Tron: Legacy. The soundtrack album of the film was released on 6 December 2010. A deluxe 2-disc edition of the album was also released that includes a poster of the duo from the film. Additional bonus tracks are also available through various online vendors. An official music video for \"Derezzed\", with a running time of less than two minutes, also premiered on the MTV Networks on the same day the album was released. The video, which features Olivia Wilde as Quorra in specially shot footage, along with images of Daft Punk in Flynn's Arcade, was later made available for purchase from the iTunes Store and included in the DVD and Blu-ray releases of the film. Walt Disney Records released a remix album of the score titled Tron: Legacy Reconfigured on 5 April 2011.\n\nIn 2010 Daft Punk were admitted into the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, an order of merit of France. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo were individually awarded the rank of Chevalier (knight). Soma Records released a previously unpublished Daft Punk track called \"Drive\" that was made during the same time the duo was still with Soma Records and recording \"Rollin' and Scratchin'\" and \"Da Funk\". The track was included in a 20th anniversary multi-artist compilation of the Soma label. In October 2011, Daft Punk placed 28th in a worldwide official poll of DJ Magazine after appearing at position 44 in the year before. On 19 January 2012, Daft Punk ranked No. 2 on Mixmag's Greatest Dance Acts of All Time, with The Prodigy at No. 1 by just a few points.\n\nIn October 2012, Daft Punk provided a fifteen-minute mix of songs by blues musician Junior Kimbrough for Hedi Slimane's Yves Saint Laurent fashion show.[40] The duo also placed 44th in DJ Magazine's annual Top 100 DJs list.\n\nDaft Punk is currently working on their forthcoming album in collaboration with singer-songwriter Paul Williams and Chic frontman Nile Rodgers. Williams mentioned the collaboration in two separate interviews, and that the project has been in production since 2010. During an interview with Rodgers, he stated that he would meet with Daft Punk to discuss the duo's upcoming album. Rodgers later said that he and Daft Punk had an informal jam session when they met, and that a formal collaboration would be undertaken. Although Williams stated that Daft Punk's new album could be released as early as June 2012, it was later confirmed that this would not be the case.\n\nIn May 2012 it was announced that Giorgio Moroder had collaborated with the duo, recording a monologue about his life in a vocal booth containing microphones ranging from the 1960s to present day. When asked, the engineer responded that each mic was used to represent the different decades of Moroder's life in his monologue. Rodgers was also present during the recording session. Chilly Gonzales stated in an interview that he had performed material for the duo's project in a one-day session: \"I played for hours and they\u2019re gonna grab what they grab and turn it into whatever.\" He also said that the album would be released \"next spring\".\n\nIn an interview conducted on 28 November 2012 with Fourplay member Nathan East, he said to have collaborated with the duo on the project. In this interview, it is also implied that the album will be available in CD format. On 4 January 2013, Nile Rodgers talked about his number of collaborations to be released in 2013 on his blog, and also stated \"The next time [he sets] foot in Japan, [his] collaboration with Daft Punk would have started to hit people's eardrums\".\n\n\nhttp://www.daftpunk.com\nhttp://www.daftalive.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Daft+Punk\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It hit #18 in the UK and #3 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. In 2000, on his first show back from heart surgery, American late night comedian David Letterman introduced the band's performance of the song with \"here's my favorite band, performing my favorite song\".  This appearance made Foo Fighters the first band to perform the same song twice on Letterman's \"The Late Show\" program. The band would later perform \"Everlong\" on Letterman's final show in May 2015.\n\nEverlong has been featured in the popular music themed video games Rock Band 2 and Guitar Hero World Tour.\n\nAlthough the song is normally performed with electric guitars, vocalist/guitarist Dave Grohl's solo acoustic variation gained popularity after an impromptu rendition on Howard Stern's radio show in 1997. The band has often performed the acoustic version of the song live since then.\n\nA common feature of the electric live performances of Everlong involves Dave playing the first two verses and choruses on his own, with the entire band joining in for the final parts of the song. This can be seen on the Hyde Park DVD.\n\nA different acoustic version of this song concludes the 2006 live CD and DVD Skin and Bones.\n\nA muzak version of the chorus appears in the opening and closing scenes of band's music video for \"Learn to Fly,\" from the subsequent album There Is Nothing Left to Lose. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Everlong\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Grohl noted:\n\nThat's the thing with lyrics, you never want to give away specifics, because it's nice for people to have their own idea or interpretation of the song. But, you know, everyone's been fucked over before and I think a lot of people feel fucked over right now and they're not getting what they were promised, and so something to do with that.\n\nGrohl also told XFM \"The Pretender\" wasn't initially planned for the album and happened really quickly.\n\nThat song didn't happen until later on in the session. We didn't go into making the record with that song and it happened after we recorded a lot of stuff. Up until that point, I didn't know if we had a good opening song or not. So after we recorded it, I thought, 'oh this is perfect, we have the song to open the record,' and it just became everybody's favorite song. ... It's the type of song that I look forward to opening shows with and it came together really easily. We put that song together in, I don't know, a day, whereas a lot of the other songs we worked on for weeks.\"\n\n\nMUSIC VIDEO\nThe video was directed by Sam Brown. It is presented in letterbox format and heavily employs pans, zooms, and tracking shots. It consists of the band performing the song in an airplane hangar with many strip lights on the ceiling. Behind the band is a large red screen, which is thick and solid. The band is then faced by what appears to be a riot police officer, who stands behind a black line on the floor, around 30 feet or so from the band. He has the number 21 on his bullet-proof vest. As the song progresses, he is joined by more riot police officers, and a panning shot shows us that to his left, the numbers on the officers' vests descend all the way to \"01\". Assuming that there are the same number of officers on the man's right side, it can be gathered that there are 41 officers overall. As the quieter bridge begins, the video slows down as the officers charge at the band. Just as the band repeats the song's louder chorus, the screen suddenly explodes and a red liquid erupts from the red screen overwhelming the police officers but affecting the band to a lesser extent. At the end of the video, Dave Grohl is shown slamming his guitar on the floor as he falls to his knees.\n\nRECEPTION\nThis song was #47 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007.[3]The song was a 2008 Grammy Award nominee for Best Rock Song. It won the Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance the same year. This song was also #94 on MTV Asia's list of Top 100 Hits of 2007.\n\nThis album was the fourth consecutive Foo Fighters album to have a song reach the top of the U.S. Hot Modern Rock Tracks. \"The Pretender\" is one of Foo Fighters' most successful songs; only \"Learn to Fly\" and \"Best of You\" beat its position on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. \"The Pretender\" was the most densely played alternative rock song of 2007.

Although it sold the most singles, two songs by the band have gotten more airplay, \"The Pretender\", and \"All My Life\". \"Long Road to Ruin\" has gotten the same amount of airplay.\n\nThe album version was one of 5 Grammy nominations the Foo Fighters received in 2005, for Best Rock Song, but it eventually lost to \"City of Blinding Lights\" by U2.\n\nAn acoustic live version of this song is available on both the 2006 CD and DVD Skin and Bones. It is performed solo by vocalist/guitarist Dave Grohl.\n\n\"Best of You\" gave Foo Fighters their highest ever entry on the Australian rock radio station Triple J's Hottest 100 at #4.\n\nIts music video was directed by Mark Pellington, best known for his work on the video for \"Jeremy\" by Pearl Jam. He was inspired by the death of his wife a few months prior to the shoot, and was drawn to the song's notion of dealing with pain in life.\n\nThe video features the band playing on top of a tower. Along with the band's scenes are some random clips that show pain, depression, or anger:\n    * Clips with children playing alone or with each other, one scene shows one girl hugging another.\n    * A car crash\n    * A lion pouncing on its prey, which is a vulture\n    * A snake attacks a rodent\n    * A zebra kicks another zebra behind itself\n    * A snarling wolf\n    * Crash test dummies being crushed by a car crash test\n    * Men and women showing affection for each other.\n\nThere have been many remakes of the video on MySpace, with some featuring live performances, CGI/animation, and parodies of the original video's plot line. This song was featured on the MTV series Making the Video.\n\nThe band performed the song at Live Earth in London, where Grohl dedicated the song to \"you know who.\" This is widely believed to be aimed at the George W. Bush administration and their environmental policy. After the band's performance at Live Earth, the song again entered the UK charts at #38. It had previously peaked at #4, giving them their highest performing song there as well. \n\nCOVERS:\n*Prince covered the song during the halftime show at Super Bowl XLI in Miami, Florida, on February 4, 2007. Drummer Taylor Hawkins expressed surprise by the performance, due to Prince's prior criticism of the band's desire to release a cover version of his song, \"Darling Nikki\", in 2003.\n*Welsh band Stereophonics covered the song for BBC Radio 1 in December 2007\n\nMEDIA\n*The song was also mentioned in an episode of the NBC series 30 Rock.\n*At the 2008 UEFA Cup Final, the song was played as the two competitors, Glasgow Rangers and Zenit St Petersburg, entered the field at the City of Manchester Stadium, England and when Anatoliy Tymoschuk lifted the trophy. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Best+of+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released on two different singles in the UK in 1999. \"Learn to Fly\" is one of the band's most successful singles, including a #19 peak on the Billboard Hot 100 and a #1 peak on Modern Rock Tracks.\n\nMUSIC VIDEO\nThe music video for the song takes place on an airplane, parodying the movie Airplane!. Two airline mechanics (played by Tenacious D) hide what appears to be drugs in the coffee-maker (it is revealed in the band's official website that the package is actually labelled \"World Domination brand 'Erotic' Sleeping Powder\"), which ends up incapacitating everyone who drinks the coffee. The band, having avoided the coffee, finds themselves forced to land the plane. For the video, each band member (Dave Grohl, Nate Mendel and Taylor Hawkins) portrays himself as well as several other roles.\n\nAccompanying the opening and closing scenes of the film clip is a muzak version of \"Everlong\". The video was filmed in London, England in a cabin crew training airplane. The video won the 2001 Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video.\n\nCharacters Dave Grohl portrays\n    * Himself\n    * The Pilot\n    * A flamboyant flight attendant\n    * A teenage girl who is a big fan of the band\n    * One of the overweight ladies\n    * An FBI agent\n\nCharacters Nate Mendel portrays\n    * Himself\n    * One of the co-pilots of the plane\n    * A nerd-like man sitting between the two obese women portrayed by Grohl and Hawkins\n    * A flight attendant who accidentally mixes the drugs with the coffee\n    * A baby\n\nCharacters Taylor Hawkins portrays\n    * Himself\n    * A female flight attendant\n    * One of the co-pilots of the plane\n    * One of the overweight ladies\n\nMEDIA\n*The song is featured as a playable track in the music video game Rock Band.\n*The song was played in space as a wake-up call for Space Shuttle Mission STS-118 on 2007-08-18 (day 11 of the mission). It was the second Foo Fighters wake-up call played on that mission.[2]\n*The song was played in an episode of Scrubs (entitled \"My Unicorn\") as J.D was being chased by a toy airplane.\n*The song \"Make a Bet\" is one of the oldest known Foo Fighters songs. It was first demoed by Grohl and some friends in 1992, under the guise of Allister Lob. This version had no vocals. It was later reworked and re-recorded with vocals during the The Colour and the Shape sessions but went unreleased until the \"Learn to Fly\" single was released. Finally, another reworking of the song entitled \"Win Or Lose\" was recorded during the One By One sessions and was released on the \"All My Life\" single in 2002.\n*The song \"Learn To Fly\" was used as the background music for the Alta/Snowbird segment in Warren Miller's 1999 film \"Fifty.\"\n*Jack Black and Kyle Gass from Tenacious D make an appearance in the music video playing the maintenance crew who drug the plane and are arrested at the end. Grohl has done the drum work on both Tenacious D albums, and has played the demon in the \"Tribute\" music video, and The Devil in the feature-length film The Pick of Destiny. Tenacious D and Grohl have also collaborated as cast members in the film clip for I Want You So Hard (Boy's Bad News) by the Eagles of Death Metal.\n*The song is used in the closing scene of an episode of the CBBC program Best Of Friends.\n*Dave Grohl had reportedly said that it was his least favorite song off of the album, despite being a fan favorite. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Learn+to+Fly\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

According to Dave Grohl, the song is dedicated to ordinary, everyday heroes, as he himself never had musical or sports heroes growing up as a child. During Foo Fighters' appearance on VH1 Storytellers in 2009, Dave Grohl explained that the song was written while watching 1980s movies like Valley Girl (film). Grohl also stated that the song was written about Pete Stahl and Chip Donaldson, without even knowing it.\nThe song was featured in the 1999 movie Varsity Blues, during the climactic scene of the final football game. It was also featured in the 2001 film Not Another Teen Movie, in a scene parodying the aforementioned Varsity Blues football game. Part of the song is also heard in the 2010 buddy-cop comedy The Other Guys.\nIn a post-September 11 episode of CBS's Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn (September 21, 2001), Grohl and bassist Nate Mendel performed an acoustic rendition of the song.

The song won a Grammy Award for best hard rock performance, and spent ten straight weeks at #1 on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart, coincidentally succeeding Nirvana and their previously unreleased final recording, \"You Know You're Right\". Dave Grohl notes that the band had wanted a heavier sounding song to appear as a single, stating that the band were \"coming out with \"Learn to Fly\" and \"Next Year\" and other songs that had middle-of-the-road melodies.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/All+My+Life\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is in 4/4 time but includes 7/4 irregular time signature timing in the main riff. The chorus of the song is also grouped in bars of 3 rather than the regular bars of 4. The song is sometimes listed by its full original title, \"Times Like These (One-Way Motorway).\" The lyric \"I'm a new day rising\" is a reference to the album New Day Rising by H\u00fcsker D\u00fc, one of Dave Grohl's favorite groups.\n\nAfter the album version ended its run on the charts, a solo acoustic version of the song performed by Grohl was released and had some success on pop and adult contemporary radio. The entire band performed a version of the song with jazz pianist Chick Corea during the Grammy Awards in 2004.\n\nBoth of the band's official live DVD releases, 2003's Everywhere but Home and 2006's Skin and Bones, feature acoustic performances of the song.\n\nGlen Campbell recorded the song for his Meet Glen Campbell album in 2008.\n\nThe song was used by George W. Bush for his 2004 re-election campaign without the band's knowledge. When Grohl found out about it, it prompted him and the rest of the band to get more politically active, and they helped John Kerry's campaign as a result.\n\n'Times Like These' has also been released as a Rock Band and Rock Band 2 DLC track on Xbox Live and PSN on December 23, 2008. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Times+Like+These\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Click to..."}, "description": "\"Long Road to Ruin\" is the second single from the Foo Fighters' sixth studio album Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace (2007). The music video was released on November 1 2007, with the single released on December 3 2007. The video features an appearance by actress Rashida Jones, and was directed by Jesse Peretz, who had previously collaborated with the band for \"Big Me\", \"Learn to Fly\", \"The One\", and \"Low\".\n\n\"Long Road to Ruin\" began with a slow start, but still managed to top the Modern Rock Tracks chart for seven consecutive weeks and reach #2 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks. The song had been successful in the rock charts but achieved small success on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching #89. With \"Long Road to Ruin\" topping the Modern Rock Tracks earlier this year, it made Foo Fighters the first act to have a number 1 hit every year for four consecutive years.\n\nUnlike the US, in Europe the song has had major success peaking in the top 40 of the pop charts and number 1 on the UK Rock Chart. The success was aided due to a Radio 1 performance and an extensive tour in the UK.\n\nThe music video of the song is a comedic spoof of a stereotypical 1970s-era hospital soap opera (General Hospital in particular), and is essentially a \"show within a show\". As seen in the opening credit sequence, the Foo Fighters portray the actors who in turn portray the show's characters. Grohl plays \"Davy Grolton\", who stars as the main doctor, \"Hansom Davidoff\". Drummer Taylor Hawkins plays \"Ty Hawkstone\" (\"Les Groper\", Davidoff's womanizing colleague). Guitarist Chris Shiflett plays \"Christopher Mishomotohama\" (\"Little Jimmy\", a severely injured child). Bassist Nate Mendel plays \"Ned Bender\" (\"Saul Goode\", the show's shady antagonist). Actress Rashida Jones guest stars as \"Racinda Jules\" (\"Susan Belfontaine\", the doctor's love interest).\n\nIn order to avoid confusion with the soap opera (also entitled \"Long Road to Ruin\") and the \"real world\", the scenes in the soap opera have brown tones to make it more vintage, while the real world retains normal color. There are various accidents and rifts on-stage (a fight between the cast, Grolton inadvertently hitting Jules in the face.). Backstage, Grolton's cast mates read a magazine about him becoming a rock star, and later place his debut album on a dartboard and throw darts at it. Upset, Grolton goes outside, only to find screaming teenage girls who want his autograph. After wiping away tears, he accommodates and interacts with them.\n\nThe video then cuts to a concert in a mall where he fronts \"The Davy Grolton Band\" and performs the song. The band is also portrayed by the other Foo Fighter members, in attire appropriate of the era. The scene is inter-cut with flashbacks about Jules. While singing, he sees her amidst the audience filled with the ravenous girls, but she leaves after realizing he has spotted her. He ends the performance to give chase with the fans behind him, but when he finally finds her, she has driven off. Grolton becomes hysterical before continuing his pursuit.\n\nThe video is interspersed throughout with scenes of Grolton driving in a car, wistfully singing the song. The final scene has him intentionally driving off a cliff in a typical 1970s television or movie death scene, with the vehicle bursting into flames during the fall. In what is likely an intentional continuity error, Grolton is clearly in an open-top Jaguar E-Type, while the crash footage depicts what appears to be a 1990's Porsche. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Long+Road+to+Ruin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It already charted #60 in Canadian Hot 100 and in Mainstream Rock Tracks where it peaks at #5.

It was released on two main discs in 2000.  The song charted at #17 on the Modern Rock Tracks\n\nMUSIC VIDEO:\nThe video, directed by Phil Harder, shows the band in a remake of the Apollo 11 moon mission and incorporates heavy use of NASA stock footage. They experience zero-gravity in the space capsule (where they conduct experiments and perform the song with instruments), land on the moon, plant a Foo Fighters flag, and return to Earth where they are welcomed back as heroes during a ticker-tape parade. Many moments and images of the Apollo era are re-enacted, such as the band meeting President Richard Nixon, bassist Nate Mendel golfing on the moon (a nod to Alan Shepard during Apollo 14), and depictions of Vietnam war protests. The video ends with a portrait of the band in the style of a traditional astronaut crew photo.\n\nMEDIA:\nThe opening of \"Next Year\" was used as the theme song for the NBC television series Ed (2000-2004).\n\nThe show's creators, Rob Burnett and Jon Beckerman (formerly of the Late Show with David Letterman) used the song despite knowledge of production company Viacom's insistence that they own the rights to the show's theme song. \"Next Year\" was thus ultimately replaced by Clem Snide's \"Moment in the Sun\" during the second season. As a result of outcries from Burnett and Beckerman, however, Viacom relented and \"Next Year\" returned as the theme song in the third and fourth seasons.\n\nThe show was also a production of Letterman's Worldwide Pants Incorporated with Letterman serving as an executive producer. Burnett, Beckerman, and Letterman in particular are all known to be avid Foo Fighters fans.

Grohl formed the group as a one-man project after the dissolution of his previous band Nirvana in 1994. Prior to the release of Foo Fighters in 1995, Grohl drafted Nate Mendel (bass), William Goldsmith (drums) (both of Sunny Day Real Estate and The Fire Theft), and Pat Smear (guitar) (of The Germs) to complete the group. Goldsmith left during the recording of the group's second album The Colour and the Shape (1997), soon followed by Smear. They were replaced by Taylor Hawkins and Franz Stahl, respectively, although Stahl left prior to the recording of the group's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose (1999).\n\nChris Shiflett joined as the band's second guitarist after the completion of There Is Nothing Left to Lose. The band released its fourth album One by One in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc In Your Honor (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and harder-rocking material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace in 2007. Over the course of the band's career, three of its albums have won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Album, and all six have been nominated for Grammys. The band's seventh album Wasting Light was released in 2011 and peaked at #1 in several countries.\n\nFormation and debut album\nDave Grohl joined the band Nirvana as the group's drummer in 1990. In order to occupy himself during tours, he took a guitar with him and wrote songs. Grohl held back these songs from the band; he said in 1997, \"I was in awe of frontman Kurt Cobain's songs. And intimidated. I thought it was best that I keep my songs to myself.\" Instead, Grohl occasionally booked studio time to record demos, and even issued a cassette of some of those songs called Pocketwatch under the pseudonym \"Late!\" in 1992.\n\nCobain was found dead in his Seattle home on April 8, 1994, and Nirvana subsequently disbanded. Grohl received offers to work with various artists, and almost accepted a permanent position as the drummer in Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Ultimately Grohl declined and instead entered a studio in October 1994 to record twelve of the forty songs he had written. With the exception of a guitar part on \"X-Static\" by Greg Dulli of the Afghan Whigs, Grohl played every instrument and sang every vocal on the tracks. \"I was supposed to just join another band and be a drummer the rest of my life,\" Grohl later said. \"I thought that I would rather do what no-one expected me to do. I enjoy writing music and I enjoy trying to sing, and there's nothing anyone can really do to discourage me.\" Grohl completed an album's worth of material in five days and handed out cassette copies of the sessions to his friends for feedback.\n\nGrohl hoped to keep his anonymity and release the recordings in a limited run under the title \"Foo Fighters\", taken from the World War II term \"foo fighter\", used to refer to unidentified flying objects. According to Rope Songfacts, he was reading a book about military World War II sightings at the time and he wanted people to think it was a band. So he called it Foo Fighters as it was plural. However, the demo tape circulated in the music industry, creating interest among record labels. Grohl formed a band to support the album. Initially, Grohl talked to former Nirvana band mate Krist Novoselic about joining the group, but both decided against it. \"For Krist and I, it would have felt really natural and really great\", Grohl explained. \"But for everyone else, it would have been weird, and it would have left me in a really bad position. Then I really would have been under the microscope.\" Having heard about the disbanding of Seattle-based emo band Sunny Day Real Estate, Grohl drafted the group's bass player, Nate Mendel, and drummer, William Goldsmith. Grohl asked Pat Smear, who served touring guitarist for Nirvana after the release of its 1993 album In Utero, to join as the group's second guitarist. Grohl ultimately licensed the album to Capitol Records, releasing it on his new record label, Roswell Records.\n\nThe group played its debut show at a keg party in February 1995. Grohl refused to do interviews or tour large venues to promote the album. Foo Fighters undertook their first major tour in the spring of 1995, opening for Mike Watt. The band's first single \"This Is a Call\" was released in June 1995, and its debut album Foo Fighters was released the next month. \"I'll Stick Around\", \"For All The Cows\" and \"Big Me\" were released as subsequent singles. The band spent the following months on tour, including their first appearance at the Reading Festival in England in August.\n\nThe Colour and the Shape\nAfter touring through the spring of 1996, Foo Fighters entered a studio in Woodinville, Washington with producer Gil Norton to record its second album. While Grohl once again wrote all the songs, the rest of the band collaborated on the arrangements. With the sessions nearly complete, Grohl took the rough mixes with him to Los Angeles, intending to finish up his vocal and guitar parts. While there, Grohl realized that he wasn't happy with how the mixes were turning out, and the band \"basically re-recorded almost everything\". During the L.A. sessions, Grohl played drums on some of the songs. Goldsmith said Grohl did not tell him that he recorded new drum parts for the record and, feeling betrayed, left the band.\n\nIn need of a replacement for Goldsmith, Grohl contacted Alanis Morissette's touring drummer Taylor Hawkins to see if he could recommend anybody. Grohl was surprised when Hawkins volunteered his own services as drummer. Hawkins made his debut with the group in time for the release of its second album, The Colour and the Shape, in May 1997. The album spawned the singles \"Monkey Wrench\", \"My Hero\", and \"Everlong\".\n\nPat Smear announced to the rest of the group that he wanted to leave the band to pursue other interests. Four months later in September 1997 at the MTV Video Music Awards, Smear simultaneously publicly announced his departure from the band and introduced his replacement, Grohl's former Scream bandmate Franz Stahl. Stahl toured with the band for the next few months, and appeared on two tracks that the band recorded for movie soundtracks, a re-recording of \"Walking After You\" for The X-Files and \"A320\" for Godzilla.\n\nThere Is Nothing Left to Lose\nIn 1998, Foo Fighters traveled to Grohl's home state of Virginia to write music for its third album. However, Grohl and Stahl were unable to co-operate as songwriters; Grohl told Kerrang! in 1999, \"In those few weeks it just seemed like the three of us were moving in one direction and Franz wasn't\". Grohl was distraught about the decision to fire Stahl, as the two had been friends since childhood. The remaining trio of Grohl, Mendel, and Hawkins spent the next several months recording the band's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose, in Grohl's Virginia home studio. The album spawned several singles, including \"Learn to Fly\", the band's first single to reach the US Hot 100.\n\nBefore the release of the album, Capitol president Gary Gersh was forced out of the label. Given Grohl's history with Gersh, Foo Fighters' contract had included a \"key man clause\" that allowed them to leave the label upon Gersh's departure. They subsequently left Capitol and signed to RCA, who later acquired the rights to the band's Capitol albums.\nChris Shiflett joined Foo Fighters as a touring guitarist before becoming a full member\n\nAfter recording was completed, the band auditioned a number of potential guitarists, and eventually settled on Chris Shiflett, who previously performed with No Use for a Name and Me First and the Gimme Gimmes. Shiflett initially joined the band as touring guitarist, but achieved full-time status prior to the recording of the group's fourth album.\n\nThat same year, Foo Fighters established a relationship with rock band Queen, of whom the band (particularly Grohl and Hawkins) are fans. Guitarist Brian May added a guitar track to Foo Fighters' second cover of Pink Floyd's \"Have a Cigar\", which appeared on the soundtrack to the movie Mission Impossible 2. When Queen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2001, Grohl and Hawkins were invited to perform with the band on \"Tie Your Mother Down\", with Grohl filling in on vocals for Freddie Mercury. In 2002, guitarist May contributed guitar work to \"Tired of You\" and an outtake called \"Knucklehead\". The bands have performed together on several occasions since, including VH1 Rock Honors and Foo Fighters' headlining concert in Hyde Park.\n\nOne by One\nNear the end of 2001, the band reconvened to record their fourth album. After spending four months in a Los Angeles studio completing the album, Grohl spent some time helping Queens of the Stone Age complete their 2002 album Songs for the Deaf. Once the Queens of the Stone Age album was finished, Grohl, inspired by the sessions, decided to reconvene Foo Fighters to rework a few songs on their album. Instead, they re-recorded nearly all of the album (save \"Tired of You\") in a ten-day stretch at Grohl's studio in Virginia. The final album was released in October of 2002 under the title One by One. Singles from the album included \"All My Life\", \"Times Like These\", \"Low\", and \"Have It All\". The band later expressed displeasure with the album. Grohl told Rolling Stone in 2005, \"Four of the songs were good, and the other seven I never played again in my life. We rushed into it, and we rushed out of it.\"\n\nFor most of its history, the band chose to stay away from the political realm. However, in 2004 prior to donating 3 million dollars to the new Pittsburgh Penguins arena, upon learning that George W. Bush's presidential campaign was using \"Times Like These\" at rallies, Grohl decided to lend his public support to John Kerry's campaign. Grohl attended several Kerry rallies and occasionally performed solo acoustic sets. The entire band eventually joined Grohl for a performance in Arizona coinciding with one of the presidential debates.\n\nIn Your Honor and acoustic tour\nHaving spent a year and a half touring behind One By One, Grohl did not want to rush into recording another Foo Fighters record. Initially Grohl intended to write acoustic material by himself, but eventually the project involved the entire band. To record its fifth album, the band shifted to Los Angeles and built a recording studio, dubbed Studio 606 West. Grohl insisted that the album be divided into two discs\u2013one full of rock songs, the other featuring acoustic tracks. In Your Honor was released in June 2005. The album's singles included \"Best of You\", \"DOA\", \"Resolve\", \"No Way Back\", and \"Miracle\".\n\nOn June 17, 2006, Foo Fighters performed their largest non-festival headlining concert to date at London's Hyde Park. The band was supported by Juliette and the Licks, Angels & Airwaves, Queens of the Stone Age, and Mot\u00f6rhead. Mot\u00f6rhead's Lemmy joined the band on stage to sing \"Shake Your Blood\" from Dave Grohl's Probot album. Also, as a surprise performance, Brian May and Roger Taylor of Queen jammed with Foo Fighters, playing part of \"We Will Rock You\" as a lead into \"Tie Your Mother Down\".\n\nIn further support of In Your Honor, the band decided to organize a short acoustic tour for the summer of 2006. The tour included former member Pat Smear, who rejoined the band as an extra guitarist, Petra Haden on violin and backup vocals, Drew Hester on percussion, and Rami Jaffee of The Wallflowers on keyboards/piano. While much of the setlist focused on In Your Honor's acoustic half, the band also used the opportunity to play lesser-known songs such as \"Ain't It The Life\", \"Floaty\", and \"See You\". The band also performed \"Marigold\", a Pocketwatch-era song that was best-known as a Nirvana B-side.\n\nIn November 2006, the band released their first ever live CD, Skin and Bones, featuring fifteen performances captured over a three-night stand in Los Angeles. An accompanying DVD was released, and featured tracks not available on the CD.\n\nEchoes, Silence, Patience & Grace\nFor the follow-up to In Your Honor, the band decided to call in The Colour and the Shape producer Gil Norton. Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace was released in September 2007. The album's first single, \"The Pretender\", was issued to radio in early August. The second single, \"Long Road to Ruin\", was released in December 2007, supported by a music video directed by longtime collaborator Jesse Peretz (formerly of the Lemonheads).\n\nIn mid-to-late 2007 \"The Pretender\" topped the Modern Rock chart for a record 18 weeks, it also gave the band their third consecutive year at the top (a record), and made them the only artist besides Red Hot Chili Peppers to have 4 consecutive albums have songs reach the top (RHCPs have 5). When \"Long Road to Ruin\" reached the top it gave them their fourth consecutive year to have a song reach the top (breaking their own record). When the fourth single, \"Let It Die\", reached the top 20 it gave them 3 songs in the top 20, one of only four artists to do this. \"Let It Die\" is also the album's third Number One hit on the chart.\n\nNot long after completing the recording sessions for the album, the band participated in Live Earth at Wembley Stadium in London, England, performing the penultimate set of the night. Later that summer, the band headlined V Festival 2007, including a surprise acoustic set on the Channel 4 stage under the name 606. In October 2007, Foo Fighters started their world tour in support for Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace. The band performed shows throughout the United States, Europe, Australia, Canada and Asia. The band finished its world tour in September 2008 at the Virgin Festival at Toronto Island Park in Canada.\n\nEchoes, Silence, Patience & Grace was nominated for 5 Grammys in 2008. The Foo Fighters went home with Best Rock Album and Best Hard Rock Performance (for \"The Pretender\"). The album was also nominated for Album of the Year, while \"The Pretender\" was also nominated for Record of the Year and Best Rock Song.\n\nOn 17 September 2008 Dave Grohl announced on The Chris Moyles Show that the band would be taking a long break from music so that they could return with a new sense of purpose, and also informed fans not to expect any new music for a while. \"We've never really taken a long break, I think it's time,\" Grohl commented. \"After doing Wembley, we shouldn't come back there for 10 years because we've played to everybody. We're over in the UK every year, every summer, so I think it's time to take a break and come back over when people really miss us.\"\n\n Wasting Light \n\nAfter taking a break from music, Foo Fighters returned in 2011 with the album Wasting Light. The album was recorded in Dave Grohl's garage, as opposed to Studio 606. Grohl addressed by stating \"There's poetry in being the band that can sell out Wembley but also makes a record in a garage.\" Wasting Light features many guest musicians, including Krist Novoselic, who had played with Grohl in Nirvana. \n\nFoo Fighters released a 30 second teaser on January 17th 2011 of the song \"Bridge Burning\", and on February 1st 2011 the announcement of the release date of the album, April 12th 2011, was accompanied by a 30 second teaser of \"Miss the Misery\". On February 12th, the music video for \"White Limo\" was released. And on February 23rd \"Rope\" was released for online streaming. \n\nOn March 1st \"Rope\" was released as the first single from the album. It peaked at number 1 in the US on the Rock, Alternative, and Mainstream Rock charts.\n\nOn April 9th the band appeared on Saturday Night Live (host Helen Miren). They played the song \"Rope\" for their first performance, and debuted the song \"Walk\" for their second. \n\nWasting Light peaked at number 1 on the Albums chart in 12 countries, including the US and UK. It has achieved platinum status in Australia and New Zeland. \n\nMusical style\nWhen Grohl first started the band, its music was often compared to that of his previous group, Nirvana. Grohl acknowledged that Nirvana singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain was a major influence on his songwriting. Grohl said, \"Through Kurt, I saw the beauty of minimalism and the importance of music that's stripped down.\" Foo Fighters also utilize the Pixies' technique of shifting between quiet verses and loud chorus, which Grohl said was influenced by the members of Nirvana \"liking the Knack, Bay City Rollers, The Beatles, and Abba as much as we liked Flipper and Black Flag, I suppose\". Writing and recording songs for the first Foo Fighters album by himself, Grohl wrote the guitar riffs to be as rhythmic as possible. He approached the guitar similar to how he approached playing a drumkit, assigning different drum parts to different strings on the instrument. This allowed him to piece together songs easily; he said, \"I could hear the song in my head before it was finished.\" Once Grohl assembled a full band, his bandmates assisted in song arrangements.\n\nThe members of Foo Fighters meld melodic elements with harder sounds. Grohl noted in 1997, \"We all love music, whether it's the Beatles or Queen or punk rock. I think the lure of punk rock was the energy and immediacy; the need to thrash stuff around. But at the same time, we're all suckers for a beautiful melody, you know? So it is just natural.\"\n\nCampaigning and activism\nIn 2000, the band generated controversy through their public support of Alive & Well, an organization that denies the link between HIV and AIDS, questions the validity of HIV tests, and advises against taking medication to counter the disease. Foo Fighter bassist Nate Mendel learned of Alive & Well through What If Everything You Thought You Knew about AIDS Was Wrong?, a self-published book written by Christine Maggiore, the organization's founder. Mendel passed the book around to the rest of the band, who supported his advocacy.\n\nIn January 2000, the band played a benefit concert for the organization, which Mendel helped to organize. The band also contributed songs to The Other Side of AIDS, a controversial documentary film by Maggiore's husband Robin Scovill, which questions whether HIV is the cause of AIDS. The band's position caused alarm in the medical community, as Alive & Well's advice ran contrary to established medical wisdom about HIV and AIDS. In a 2000 interview, Mendel spoke of using Foo Fighters' popularity to help spread the group's message and of holding more benefits for the organization. However, no further benefits have taken place, and the band has since removed the organization from its list of supported causes.\n\n\nNon-VEVO youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi2KNss4Yx73NG0JARSFe0A <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It has since become highly-acclaimed as one of the band's most popular songs. Released as a single in March 1987, it became the group's first American #1 hit, spending three weeks at the top. It also reached #4 in the UK and #2 on the Dutch Top 40.\n\nAccording to Bono, the song was heavily influenced by Scott Walker's album Climate of Hunter. It was U2's first single to be widely issued on CD. The song is U2's second most frequently covered song.\n\nIn addition to topping the Billboard Hot 100, the song reached #1 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and was the second U2 song to enter any other Billboard chart (specifically, the Adult Contemporary chart) after \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\". In addition, the song spent eleven weeks in the top 75 of the UK Singles Chart. The song also re-entered the UK Singles Chart at number 43 based on download sales alone on the week ending May 31, 2009.\n\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone magazine placed the single at number 131 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\n\"With or Without You\" is written in the key of D major. There are large sections of the song where the harmony rests on the D chord; in the sections it does not, the band implies a D - A/C# - Bm7 - Gsus2 chord progression. This chord progression is implied by the roots notes played by bassist Adam Clayton and the guitar parts of The Edge. The Edge's sustained guitar part is achieved using a device dubbed \"Infinite Guitar\". The Edge explained, \"It has a similar effect to the E-Bow, but the disadvantage of the E-Bow is that it's either on or off, whereas this gives you all the mid-points between no sustain and infinite sustain, and different levels of 'emergence' of the note.\"\n\n\"With or Without You\" was first played live at the second show on the Joshua Tree Tour on 4 April 1987, and was a regular for the rest of that tour. It was played at most shows on 1989's Lovetown Tour. During these tours, two extensions to the song not present on the studio version were played: an extra verse with lyrics that typically read \"we'll shine like stars in the summer night/we'll shine like stars in the winter light/one heart, one hope, one love\" or modifications thereof, which appears on the Rattle and Hum movie; and a snippet of Joy Division's \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" which can be heard on the iTunes exclusive \"Live from Paris\" along with the lyrics \"we'll shine like stars...\" and is also part of the Bonus DVD released with the remastered box set version of The Joshua Tree. Since the PopMart Tour, it has been more common for Bono to repeat the \"Ohh\" at the climax of the song, with the \"shine like stars\" verse sung rarely.\n\n\"With or Without You\" was played at most Zoo TV Tour concerts and every concert on the PopMart Tour. It was dropped from the setlist during the third leg of the Elevation Tour, it was last played on the 13th of October 2001 at the Copps Coliseum in Hamilton. It was initially a rare inclusion during the Vertigo Tour - over the two months of the Vertigo Tour's first leg, it was only played four times. It became a regular concert inclusion during stadium concerts on the second leg in Europe and remained in the setlist for the third leg. It has been played on every night of the 360 tour thus far.\n\nUnlike most songs in U2's live catalogue, this song has been played with several different guitars, with Edge seeming to pick a new model for each tour. Over the Joshua Tree Tour, Lovetown Tour and early legs of the Zoo TV Tour, he used a Fender Stratocaster equipped with an Infinite Guitar system. For later legs of the Zoo TV Tour, he switched to the Gibson Les Paul Custom, and used an E-bow to generate the song's sustained notes. He started on the PopMart Tour his now trend of using Fernandes guitars to perform the song. On the PopMart Tour, Elevation Tour and Vertigo Tour, he has used (respectively) the Decade, Native Pro and Retrorocket Elite models. Each one is equipped with a special sustainer, which is why they are used for this song. The Fernandes models have frequently been the only guitars Edge purchases new, as opposed to the rest of his guitar collection, which are all vintage models. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/With+or+Without+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was a commercial success, helping launch the album to multi-platinum status, and is one of U2's biggest hits to date. It was their fourth #1 single in the UK and was #1 for a week in Australia. The song peaked at #21 in the US, the band's highest position since \"Discotheque\" in 1997. The song won three Grammy Awards in 2001.\n\nAccording to Bono, \"Beautiful Day\" is about \"a man who has lost everything, but finds joy in what he still has.\"\n\nThe song is an optimistic anthem that opens with a drum machine and a rhythm sequencer. The verses are relatively quiet before The Edge's guitar and the song's signature riff join in for the choruses. The Edge recorded this song on his Gibson Les Paul Standard and plays the song live with his Gibson Explorer, which helps add the distinctive shimmering, chiming sound that made the band unique when they first debuted in the early 1980s.\n\nIn an episode of the Sundance Channel's Iconoclast, R.E.M. vocalist Michael Stipe said \"I love that song. I wish I'd written it, and they know I wish I'd written it. It makes me dance, It makes me angry that I didn't write it.\" Beautiful Day also opens ITV's football show \"The Championship\", and previously ITV's \"Premiership\" referring to soccer making a beautiful day.\n\nBeautiful Day is the most known track on the All That You Can't Leave Behind album, and has been regarded as one of U2's most famous songs. The song hit No.1 on charts in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland and also boosted sales of All That You Can't Leave Behind. Beautiful Day is included on The Best of 1990-2000 and U218 Singles.\n\nThe song won three Grammys in 2001: \"Record of the Year\", \"Song of the Year\", and \"Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal\".\n\nThe song \"Beautiful Day\", which debuted on the Elevation tour, is one of only four U2 songs to have been played at every concert since their introduction (the other three being \"One\", \"Vertigo\", and \"City of Blinding Lights\").\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/Beautiful+Day\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song is noted for its militaristic drumbeat, simple but harsh guitar, and melodic harmonies. One of U2's most overtly political songs, its lyrics describe the horror felt by an observer of The Troubles in Northern Ireland.  The title and critically charged lyrics have been attributed to Bloody Sunday, which occurred on January 30th, 1972, when British paratroopers opened fire on unprovoked unarmed Catholic Northern Irish independence marchers. Formal government apologies were eventually issued to the families of the 14 killed and 13 injured.  http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/726532/Bloody-Sunday\n\nThe single was released in March 1983 in Germany and The Netherlands only; \"Two Hearts Beat As One\" was released instead in other territories. Along with \"New Year's Day\", the song helped U2 reach a wider listening audience. It was generally well-received by critics on the album's release.\n\nThe song has remained a staple of U2's live concerts. During its earliest performances, the song created controversy. Bono reasserted the song's anti-hate, anti-sectarian-violence message to his audience for many years. Today, it is considered one of U2's signature songs, being one of the band's most performed songs.

It became their second (and last as of 2008) #1 song on the Billboard Hot 100 after With or Without You, the first single from the album, and peaked at #6 in the UK Singles Chart.\nThe song originated from a demo the band recorded on which drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. played a unique rhythm pattern. Like much of The Joshua Tree, the song was inspired by the group's interest in American music. \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" exhibits influences from gospel music and its lyrics describe spiritual yearning. Lead vocalist Bono's vocals are in high register and guitarist The Edge plays a chiming arpeggio. Adding to the gospel qualities of the song are choir-like backing vocals provided by The Edge and producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois.\n\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" was critically acclaimed and received two nominations at the 30th Grammy Awards in 1988, for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. It has subsequently become one of the group's most well-known songs and has been performed on many of their concert tours. The track has appeared on several of their compilations and concert films. Many critics and publications have ranked \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" among the greatest tracks in music history. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/I+Still+Haven%27t+Found+What+I%27m+Looking+For\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released as the album's third single in August 1987 . Bono was inspired to write the lyrics by the notion that it is possible to identify a person's religion and income based on the street on which they lived, particularly in Belfast. Amidst difficulties recording the song, producer Brian Eno attempted to erase the song from the recording tapes. The song's signature is a repeating guitar arpeggio utilizing a delay effect that is played at the beginning and end of the song.\n\nThe song peaked at #14 in Canada, #10 in The Netherlands and #4 in the United Kingdom. The song has become one of the band's most popular songs, and it has remained a staple of the band's live act since the song debuted in 1987 on the Joshua Tree Tour. The song was notably performed on a Los Angeles rooftop for the filming of its music video, which won a Grammy Award for \"Best Performance Music Video\". Rolling Stone ranked the song at #28 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/Where+the+Streets+Have+No+Name\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song is driven by Adam Clayton's distinctive bassline and The Edge's keyboard. It was the band's first hit single, breaking the top ten in the UK, peaking at #10 on the singles chart, and charting on the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time in their career. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine placed the single at #427 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nHistory\n\nThe lyric had its origins in a love song from Bono to his wife, but then was reshaped and inspired by the Polish Solidarity movement.\n\nThe video was their first to see heavy rotation on MTV. It was filmed in Sweden in December 1982 and directed by Meiert Avis. The band only appeared in the performance scenes of the video as it was filmed in the dead of the Swedish winter. U2 guitarist Edge revealed in the official U2 biography that the four people riding on horseback in the video that appeared to be the four U2 members were in fact four Swedish teenage girls disguised as the members of U2 riding on horseback with masks over their faces. This was done as the band were frozen from shooting the video in sub-freezing temperatures the day before. Their biography states that Bono refused to wear any headgear despite the cold weather and had a lot of trouble mouthing the lyrics. The video also features footage of Soviet troops advancing in winter during the second world war.\n\n\"New Year's Day\" is U2's third most frequently performed live song, with The Edge switching back and forth between piano and guitar during the song. It has been a standard on every U2 tour since its debut on 1 December 1982 at the first show of the War Tour's Pre-Tour. During the 1980s, The Edge used a Fender Stratocaster to perform this song, along with a keyboard. During the 1990s and 2000s, he has alternated between a Gibson Les Paul Custom and Les Paul Standard. Coincidentally, the Les Paul the Edge used to write this song was sold for charity. Up until the Elevation Tour, Adam normally used a chorus effect on his bass guitar for this song live.\n\nIn 1983, Bono said of the song, \"It would be stupid to start drawing up battle lines, but I think the fact that 'New Year's Day' made the Top Ten indicated a disillusionment among record buyers. I don't think 'New Year's Day' was a pop single, certainly not in the way that Mickie Most might define a pop single as something that lasts three minutes and three weeks in the chart. I don't think we could have written that kind of song.\"\n\n\"New Year's Day\" has appeared on numerous U2 concert video releases, beginning with 1983's Under a Blood Red Sky.\n\nThe B-side of \"New Year's Day\", \"Treasure (Whatever Happened to Pete the Chop?)\", was never performed live. However, an early version known simply as \"Pete the Chop\" was played at some concerts in 1980 and can claim the title of being the last commercially unreleased pre-Boy song known to have been performed live. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/New+Year%27s+Day\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was filmed by Stephane Sednaoui in Morocco.\n\nWhen played live on the Zoo TV Tour, this song featured a belly dancer on stage. The version played was extended, including a longer introduction with a piano part from The Edge. Also, a slide solo is featured after what was the end of the studio version of the song. Both the added intro and outro features added lyrics from Bono, much of which is sung in the falsetto. One of the dancers, Morleigh Steinberg, later married The Edge. It has been played on every tour since it debuted, appearing on every live video release since except for Elevation 2001: Live from Boston (although it was performed at the filmed concert). Edge has always used a Rickenbacker 330-12 for this song.\n\nThe song reached #9 on the Hot 100 (the previous single, \"The Fly\", had only managed to reach #61) making it one of the band's highest-charting singles in the U.S.; only three other U2 singles (\"With or Without You\", \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\", and \"Desire\") have reached higher positions. \"Mysterious Ways\" also topped both the Modern Rock Tracks chart and the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

In 2002, \"Elevation\" won \"Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal\".\n\nDuring live shows during the Vertigo Tour, it was played without drums and bass for the first verse and chorus before the rest of the band joins in. It has been played at every U2 concert since it debuted, and it is the only song for which The Edge uses his Gibson SG.\n\nThe version of the song released as a single was entitled the \"Tomb Raider Mix\" (mixed by Paul Leary of the Butthole Surfers), differing significantly from the album version, in that it features guitars with a more 'hard rock' sound than the reggae-inspired feel of the album version. The drums in the single version are also harder, with a more traditional rock'n'roll beat. The name comes from its role in the soundtrack to the movie, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider.

It is the closing song from the movie Rattle and Hum.\n\"All I Want Is You\" was released in the UK as a single on 13 June 1989. The B-Sides featured covers of the Righteous Brothers', \"Unchained Melody\", and a cover of Love Affair's \"Everlasting Love\". It reached #4 in the UK charts and #2 in Australia, #12 on the Dutch Top 40, but only reached #83 in the North American charts. It appeared on the soundtrack for the 1994 film Reality Bites. The popularity of the song in the film led to a re-release in 1994 where it reached #38 in the US Top 40 Mainstream charts. The single was rereleased in the Netherlands with \"Everlasting Love\" now being the a-side. Everlasting Love reached number 10 in the Dutch Charts, in January 1990. In 2004, it was ranked #9 in Entertainment Weekly's list of \"The 50 Greatest Love Songs\".\n\n Music video:\nDirector Meiert Avis shot the promotional video in the town of Ostia, outside Rome on 18 April 1989. Written by Barry Devlin, the video takes an unusual cinematic approach to the song, with U2 band members making only brief cameo appearances. The video tells the story of a dwarf (played by Paolo Risi) who falls in love with a trapeze artist (played by Paola Rinaldi), one of whom apparently dies towards the end. While there is disagreement amongst fans about exactly who has died, The Edge was quoted as saying it is the trapeze artist who dies.[2] This video pays homage to Fellini, who, synchronistically, was shooting his last movie, \"La Voce Della Luna\" only a few miles away from the U2 set, and also to Tod Browning's 1932 film Freaks.[3] <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/All+I+Want+Is+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released as the album's fourth single on 7 June 1992.\n\"Even Better Than the Real Thing\" originated from a chorus guitar riff that The Edge composed in Los Angeles during the Rattle and Hum sessions. A demo of the song, called \"The Real Thing\", was recorded at STS Studios during the same session in which \"Desire\" was recorded. The band remarked that the song's guitar riff reminded them of The Rolling Stones, but that it sounded \"deeply traditional\". Consequently, it was shelved until the Achtung Baby recording sessions, when the band took the multitrack recording of the demo to Hansa Studios in Berlin in late 1990. The band made little progress on the demo there, as the Berlin sessions were plagued by conflict and difficulty in completing songs.\n\nThe song peaked at #12 becoming one of the few U2 singles that failed to reach the top 10 in the UK Singles Chart. It made #8 on the Dutch Top 40. A few months after its initial release DJ Paul Oakenfold remix charted better than the original, reaching No. 8. In the United States, the single was a hit on rock radio.[citation needed] It reached #32 on the Billboard Hot 100, #1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and #5 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. It also reached #27 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart and #35 on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart.\n\nThe song's music video won an MTV Video Music Award in 1992 for Best Special Effects for its unique 360-degree camera rollover rig, designed and built by Simon Tayler of Artem in London specifically for the video.[citation needed] <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/Even+Better+Than+the+Real+Thing\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song's lyrics describe a fictional conversation between Jesus Christ and Judas Iscariot.[1] The first verse discusses The Last Supper; the second is about Judas identifying Jesus with a kiss on the cheek in the Garden of Gethsemane; and the final is about Judas' suicide after being overwhelmed with guilt and sadness. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/Until+the+End+of+the+World\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Edge noted that \"The basic chord progression had a power that got everyone inspired. I think we all knew that it was inherently joyful, which is rare.\" A group of Moroccan percussionists played along with the band, and the result quickly became a band favourite during the sessions.\n\nBono noted that the lyrics were influenced by both Cole Porter and Bach, and that the song is about \"two lovers holding on to each other and trying to turn their life into worship.\"Lanois described the song's origins: \"We wanted to have something euphoric and Bono came up with that little melody. And he loved that melody, and stuck with it. Almost like a fanfare. And then I was involved in the lyrical process on that, because we wanted to talk about sacrifice that one makes for one's medium or one's art.

The song is one of the band's most overtly politically toned songs, with live performances often being heavily critical of war and guns. Today it receives regular airplay on rock radio stations.\n\nThe song was originally written about the United States' military intervention during the 1980s in the El Salvador Civil War. Bono told The Edge to \"put El Salvador through an amplifier\". The song is a combination of The Edge's guitar slides, Adam Clayton's laid back bassline, Larry Mullen Jr.'s cold drumming and Bono's aggressive and growly vocals during the verses, and a spoken word section during the bridge. Clayton played the song in a different key from the rest of the band: Clayton's bass riffs are in E flat minor while The Edge is playing D flat. Bono was thinking of American President Ronald Reagan as he sang \"This guy comes up to me / His face red like a rose on a thorn bush / Like all the colors of a royal flush / And he's peeling off those dollar bills / Slapping them down.\"\n\nAlthough it was never released as a single, \"Bullet the Blue Sky\" has been played at nearly every one of the band's live concerts since its first performance at the opening night of the Joshua Tree Tour on April 2, 1987. Its live performances have traditionally been paired with \"Running to Stand Still\"; this took place on the Joshua Tree Tour, Lovetown Tour, Zoo TV Tour, and the first 46 concerts of the Vertigo Tour. On the PopMart Tour, \"Bullet\" instead led into \"Please\"; Elevation Tour performances were followed by \"With or Without You\" or a cover of \"What's Going On\", and on the Vertigo Tour, \"Miss Sarajevo\" replaced \"Running to Stand Still\" for the remaining 85 concerts. It has yet to be played on the 360 tour.\n\nDuring the Joshua Tree Tour, Bono would frequently grab a large spotlight and shine into peoples' faces in the audience, performances during which he also made numerous political references to figures such as Ronald Reagan and Jerry Falwell. U2's following album, Rattle and Hum, featured one such performance of this song, with a pre-recorded intro of Jimi Hendrix's version of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". \"Bullet\" then took on new meanings throughout the subsequent years. On the Zoo TV Tour, it was about Nazism; on the Elevation Tour, it became an indictment against handgun violence, illustrated by references to John Lennon's assassination and an ironic intro video clip featuring Charlton Heston, who was at that time the leader of the National Rifle Association. On the Vertigo Tour, it was about religious violence and the final lyrics were replaced by a snippet of \"The Hands That Built America\"\n\nThe Edge has always used his black Fender Stratocaster to play this song (with the exception of the PopMart Tour, during which he used a Gibson Les Paul). Since the Zoo TV Tour in the early 1990s, Edge has played a faster, more intricate blues-inspired solo after the second chorus instead of the distorted solo found on the album version near the end of the song.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/Bullet+the+Blue+Sky\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It reached number two on the UK singles chart, number sixteen on the Billboard Hot 100, and number one on the Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts. The song was a worldwide hit, being nominated for an MTV Movie Award.\nIt started life as a track during the Zooropa sessions and was played to BP Fallon who wrote about it in his book \"U2 Faraway So Close\". The song's title comes from a play on the classic song \"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me.\" The song was played on every show of the PopMart Tour as part of the encore, and was not played again until the 2010 leg of the U2 360\u00b0 Tour, opening the second encore.\nThe animated music video to the song (interspersed with clips from the film) featured the band performing in Gotham City, with Bono battling between two of his alter-egos from the Zoo TV Tour: \"The Fly\" and \"MacPhisto\". This was intended to parallel the conflict between Bruce Wayne's ordinary playboy persona and his crime-fighting Batman persona. The band also chases the Batwing, using a yellow supercar and their guitars as flamethrowers.\n\nAt one brief point of the video, a neon sign can be seen that reads \"Mister Pussey's\". An edited version of the video from Universal Music Group uses the words \"Mister Swampy's\" for the same sign. In another scene, the band is walking down the street when Bono is run over by a car (driven by Elvis) while reading C.S. Lewis' The Screwtape Letters. The video ends with an orchestra of Batmen playing the outro on strings. It was directed by Kevin Godley and Maurice Linnane.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/Hold+Me,+Thrill+Me,+Kiss+Me,+Kill+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is a soft, slow, piano-based song about a heroin-addicted woman from the Ballymun Seven Towers area of Dublin, shown in the lyric \"I see seven towers/But I only see one way out.\" The woman's addiction is reflected in lines such as \"She runs through the streets/With her eyes painted red\" and \"She will suffer the needle chill.\" Bono's lyrics evoke helplessness and frustration: \"You've got to cry without weeping, talk without speaking, scream without raising your voice.\"\n\nThroughout its live history, \"Running to Stand Still\" has nearly always followed \"Bullet the Blue Sky\", matching the order they appear on the album, as well. It was first played live on the Joshua Tree Tour, with The Edge playing keyboards and Bono playing guitar, usually acoustic. It was played this way until the Zoo TV Tour, when it was significantly altered. In these shows, The Edge played guitar on his Fender Stratocaster while Bono sang the song on the B-stage with a headset microphone, acting like a heroin addict. It was not played on the PopMart Tour or Elevation Tour, but it returned to U2 concerts in the 2005 Vertigo Tour, with the original combination of Edge on keyboards and Bono on guitar. During most of its performance on the Vertigo Tour, it was followed by a reading of some of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; after July 2005, it was replaced in that role by \"Miss Sarajevo.\" Concert performances of \"Running to Stand Still\" are found on the Live from Paris bonus DVD from the re-release of The Joshua Tree, as well as the motion picture Rattle and Hum, and the concert films Zoo TV: Live from Sydney and Vertigo 2005: Live from Chicago. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/Running+to+Stand+Still\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

(HD)"}, "description": "\"The Fly\" is a song by rock band U2. It is the seventh track from their 1991 album Achtung Baby and was released on 12 October 1991 as the album's first single. \"The Fly\" introduced a more abrasive sounding U2, as the song featured hip-hop and industrial beats, distorted vocals, and an elaborate guitar solo. Lead vocalist Bono described the single as \"the sound of four men chopping down the Joshua Tree,\"[1] due to its departure from the traditional sound that had characterised the band in the 1980s.\n\nBono described the song's subject as that of a phone call from someone in Hell who enjoys being there and telling the person on the other end of the line what he has learned.[2] The song and its video were also a showcase for \"The Fly\", a persona that Bono took on for the Zoo TV Tour, in which he played the part of a stereotypical leather-clad rock star known for wearing large wrap-around sunglasses and strutting around the stage. The song became the band's second number-one single in the UK and was successful among alternative rock radio audiences.\nThe promotional video was the first appearance of The Fly character and displayed the band's \"new look\". The song was promoted with a music video directed by Ritchie Smythe and Jon Klein. Smythe's contribution was a basic performance video, relying heavily on unfocused, fast, wandering takes.

The group consists of Bono (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), the Edge (lead guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and Larry Mullen Jr. (drums and percussion). Initially rooted in post-punk, U2's musical style evolved throughout their career, yet has maintained an anthemic sound built on Bono's expressive vocals and the Edge's effects-based guitar textures. Their lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal and sociopolitical themes. Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several ambitious and elaborate tours over their career.\n\nThe band formed at Mount Temple Comprehensive School in 1976 when the members were teenagers with limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with Island Records and released their debut album, Boy (1980). Subsequent work such as their first UK number-one album, War (1983), and the singles \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" and \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\" helped establish U2's reputation as a politically and socially conscious group. By the mid-1980s, they had become renowned globally for their live act, highlighted by their performance at Live Aid in 1985. The group's fifth album, The Joshua Tree (1987), made them international superstars and was their greatest critical and commercial success. Topping music charts around the world, it produced their only number-one singles in the US, \"With or Without You\" and \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\".\n\nFacing creative stagnation and a backlash following their documentary/double album, Rattle and Hum (1988), U2 reinvented themselves in the 1990s through a new musical direction and public image. Beginning with their acclaimed seventh album, Achtung Baby (1991), and the multimedia-intensive Zoo TV Tour, the band integrated influences from alternative rock, electronic dance music, and industrial music into their sound, and embraced a more ironic, flippant image. This experimentation continued through their ninth album, Pop (1997), and the PopMart Tour, which were mixed successes. U2 regained critical and commercial favour with the records All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000) and How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004), which established a more conventional, mainstream sound for the group. Their U2 360\u00b0 Tour of 2009\u20132011 is the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour in history. The group's thirteenth album, Songs of Innocence (2014), was released at no cost through the iTunes Store, but received criticism for its automatic placement in users' music libraries.\n\nU2 have released 14 studio albums and are one of the world's best-selling music artists in history, having sold more than 170 million records worldwide. They have won 22 Grammy Awards, more than any other band, and in 2005, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. Rolling Stone ranked U2 at number 22 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". Throughout their career, as a band and as individuals, they have campaigned for human rights and philanthropic causes, including Amnesty International, Jubilee 2000, the ONE/DATA campaigns, Product Red, War Child, and Music Rising.\n\nFoundation: The band originally formed in 1976 when Larry Mullen posted a bulletin in his school asking for musicians to form a rock band. The band then consisted of the four current members plus three additional guitarists, including The Edge\u2019s brother Dick Evans (later a member of Virgin Prunes), Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin. According to legend, Bono originally auditioned as a guitarist but couldn\u2019t play. He auditioned as lead vocals, but really couldn\u2019t sing. He was, however, incredibly enthusiastic about the band, extremely charismatic, a great writer, and was strangely able to reach the audience when the band played, something he is known for still today. Bono will reach out into the crowd and dance or mess with someone in the crowd at every concert. He was kept as a member. The extra guitarists would soon leave the band and the group would go through the names \u201cFeedback \u201d and \u201cThe Hype\u201d before finally settling on U2.\n\nThe 70s & 80s: 1978 was a jumping point year for the band, finally finding their sound / voice. U2 won a talent contest in 1978: \u00a3500 and funds to make a record. Paul McGuinness became the band\u2019s manager and U2 released an EP called Three and the single Another Day, the following year. U2 went on to release their first album, Boy and then more critically acclaimed albums incl.: October, War, Under A Blood Red Sky, and The Unforgettable Fire (featuring the song PlayMLK dedicated to Martin Luther King Jr). Seen by many as a political band with more charisma than others, they were called \u201ca different kind\u201d of band. After a short break U2 returned with The Joshua Tree & the USA music inspired Rattle And Hum (also a movie of the same name, based on the tour).\n\nThe 90s: Promising \u201dto dream it all up again\u201d, they added industrial and dance styles to their music. Trying to drop a goody two shoes image, they went to Berlin (Germany), supposedly to develop new self-expressions. From there they started to make fun of themselves and had a good time of it in albums like Achtung Baby (meaning \u201dwatch out, baby\u201d, artwork feat. make-up artist Nassim Khalifa) & Zooropa. Bono took on many stage personae such as \u201cThe Fly\u201d, \u201cMirrorball Man\u201d and \u201cMr. MacPhisto\u201d for the gigantic ZOO TV Tour. Later they continued to make fun of Pop culture and all its extremes with the album Pop and consequent PopMart tour which was announced to be launched at a Kmart store and included a giant golden arch across the stage.\n\nThe 00s: At the end of the 90\u2019s into 00\u2019s U2 became less image and more reality. With the death of Bono\u2019s good friend Michael Hutchence, the lead singer of INXS, Bono wrote more songs from the heart surrounding ideas like life and death, children, hope, and the real world past all the pop culture and TV. Some say they\u2019ve returned to a more band-centric sound with albums like All That You Can\u2019t Leave Behind which features a song, Kite, dedicated to Bono\u2019s father who passed away shortly after the album\u2019s conception and 2004\u2019s How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb.\n\nThe 10s: U2 went on the  U2 360\u00b0 Tour in 2009 and 2010. This tour set records for the highest-grossing concert tour. The group is currently working on an upcoming album produced by Danger Mouse.\n\nThe Name: There are many theories as to the origin of the name U2. For example, U2 was an intelligence airplane that was in use by the United States during the Cold War. Other obvious candidates include \u201cYou too\u201d and \u201cYou two\u201d, etc. Nonetheless the official line on the name\u2019s origins remains unknown. The band has been quoted as saying that they did think of the U2 spy plane, but remain hushed about other reasons\u2026 U2 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/U2\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Their musical sound draws from a wide range of influences (most notably '60s and '70s psychedelic rock) and they like to see themselves as \"a steady flowing psychedelic groove rock band that emphasizes dream-like melody.\"  \n\nThe band signed a worldwide deal with label Modular Recordings in mid 2008, releasing their self titled EP in late 2008 and the single 'Sundown Syndrome' in 2009. Their debut album, \"Innerspeaker\", was released in 2010 to widespread critical acclaim. Their sophomore, \"Lonerism\", was released on October 5th, 2012, again to wide acclaim.

The song was the only U.S. number one hit for the group, and remains one of their best known songs. In the lyrics, a woman warns a man that he can be driven mad by loneliness in the wake of a broken love affair.\n\nThe members of Fleetwood Mac were experiencing emotional upheavals while recording Rumours. Drummer Mick Fleetwood was going through a divorce. Bass player John McVie was separating from his wife, keyboard player Christine McVie. Guitarist Lindsey Buckingham and Nicks were ending their eight-year relationship. \"We had to go through this elaborate exercise of denial,\" explains Buckingham to Blender Magazine, \"keeping our personal feelings in one corner of the room while trying to be professional in the other.\" These circumstances inspired the writing of \"Dreams.\"\n\nNicks wrote the song at the Record Plant studio in Sausalito, California, in early 1976. \"One day when I wasn't required in the main studio,\" remembers singer Stevie Nicks to Blender, \"I took a Fender Rhodes piano and went into another studio that was said to belong to Sly, of Sly & the Family Stone. It was a black-and-red room, with a sunken pit in the middle where there was a piano, and a big black-velvet bed with Victorian drapes.\"\n\n\"I sat down on the bed with my keyboard in front of me,\" continues Nicks. \"I found a drum pattern, switched my little cassette player on and wrote 'Dreams' in about 10 minutes. Right away I liked the fact that I was doing something with a dance beat, because that made it a little unusual for me.\"\n\nWhen Nicks played the song to the rest of the group, they decided to record it the following day. Only a basic track was recorded at Sausalito. Recording assistant Cris Morris remembers that \"all (they) kept was the drum track and live vocal from Stevie \u2014 the guitars and bass were added later in Los Angeles.\"\n\nChristine McVie described the song as having \"just three chords and one note in the left hand\" and \"boring\" when Nicks played a rough version on the piano. McVie changed her mind, after Lindsey \"fashioned three sections out of identical chords, making each section sound completely different. He created the impression that there\u2019s a thread running through the whole thing.\"\n\n\"Dreams\" reached the number one spot in the United States on June 18, 1977, and held it for one week. It went to #24 in the United Kingdom. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fleetwood+Mac/_/Dreams\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It just seemed to be a pleasant revelation to have that 'yesterday's gone,'\" Christine remembers in The Fleetwood Mac Story: Rumours and Lies, \"It might have, I guess, been directed more toward John, but I'm just definitely not a pessimist.\"\n\nIt was used by U.S. presidential candidate Bill Clinton as the theme for his first campaign, most notably at the 1992 Democratic National Convention. Upon winning the election, President Clinton persuaded the then-disbanded group to reform to perform it for his inaugural ball in 1993. At the 2000 convention, he ended his speech by saying, \"Keep putting people first. Keep building those bridges. And don't stop thinking about tomorrow!\" Immediately after this sentence, the song began playing over the loudspeakers.\n\nA live performance of the song was used as a music video. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fleetwood+Mac/_/Don%27t+Stop\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band has used the song as a signature, citing the lyric, \"Never break the chain.\"\n\nAccording to interviews on the writing of Rumours, the final section of \"The Chain\" \u2014 beginning with a bass progression \u2014 was created by John McVie and Mick Fleetwood. It seemed like an ending, not a beginning. Stevie Nicks had written the lyrics separately and thought they would be a good match; she and Christine McVie did some reworking to create the first section of the tune. To complete the song, Lindsey Buckingham recycled the intro from an earlier Buckingham/Nicks song - \"Lola My Love\", originally released on their eponymous 1973 album. Thanks to its use as a TV theme (for the BBC's Formula One coverage), the ending bass line is one of the most recognizable in the world, and although not released as a single, it does get air play.\n\nThe song itself has a basic rock structure, although it has two distinct portions: the main verse and chorus, and the outro. The song would be classified as rock, but shows the influence of hard rock, folk, and country.\n\nThe start of the studio version of this song has, in a very quiet whisper, the word \"fuck\". This can only be heard on tracks released on CD. Because of the limited dynamic range, it is not audible on the original vinyl LP, cassette or 8-track releases. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fleetwood+Mac/_/The+Chain\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

However, when Nicks' friend Robin Anderson died of leukemia, the song took on a new inspiration and Nicks held it over for Fleetwood Mac. \"Gypsy\" was the second single release and second biggest hit from the Mirage album following \"Hold Me.\" \"Gypsy\" reached #12 on the Billboard Hot 100. The video for this song, which is directed by Russell Mulcahy, was the very first \"World Premiere Video\" on MTV in 1982, and was the highest-budget music video ever produced at the time.\nOn March 25, 2009 during a show in Montreal on Fleetwood Mac's Unleashed Tour, Stevie Nicks gave a short history of the inspiration behind Gypsy. She explained it was written sometime in 1978-79, when the band had become \"very famous, very fast\", and it was a song that brought her back to an earlier time, to an apartment in San Francisco where she had taken the matress off her bed and put it on the floor. To contextualise, she voiced the lyrics: \"So I'm back, to the velvet underground. Back to the floor, that I love. To a room with some lace and paper flowers.

The song reached #8 on the U.S. charts, #6 in the U.K. and #3 in Australia and Canada. It was based in part on a rehearsal riff the band used for sound-checks.\n\nThe drum-driven single was recorded live at Dodger Stadium (without an audience) in Los Angeles, California in collaboration with the University of Southern California Trojan Marching Band. The performance was also filmed for the song's music video. John McVie was in Tahiti during the Dodger Stadium recording, but he is represented in the video by a cardboard cutout carried around by Mick Fleetwood and later positioned in the stands with the other band members.\n\nThe band's part would both set a record for the highest number of musicians performing on a single and earn the marching musicians a platinum disc. Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood presented it to the Trojan band on October 4, 1980 during a game at Dodger Stadium, this time in front of a huge crowd.\n\nThe song is played at USC Trojan football games.\n\nThis song is also played at Arkansas Razorback football games because of their current mascot named Tusk.\n\nOften used as bumper music by late night radio talk show host Art Bell when he hosted Coast to Coast AM in the 1990s.\n\nA section of the track is played at the start of each show on The Mighty Boosh Live 2008 tour. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fleetwood+Mac/_/Tusk\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The piece was composed by Peter Green.\n\nThe composition suggests a relaxing sea setting, with cymbals imitating the sound of waves and a dreamy solo from Green's guitar. It contains only two chords, Emaj7 and F#m, and could be seen as an early ambient work. It is often assumed that Green used his Les Paul but he said it was his Fender Stratocaster, as there is subtle use of the vibrato bar. The Les Paul that Green used in Fleetwood Mac has a nasal tone like that achieved in the in-between positions of a Stratocaster, and heard in the song.\n\nGreen had been working on the piece for some time before the addition to the band of 18 year old guitarist Danny Kirwan. Slide guitarist Jeremy Spencer was not generally inclined to work with Green, who had felt unable to realise the overall effect that he wanted. With Kirwan's input, Green completed the piece and it was recorded just two months after Kirwan joined, without Spencer present. Kirwan's instrumental \"Jigsaw Puzzle Blues\" was chosen for the B-side in most territories. Albatross has been re-released many times as a single in various countries, with many different B-sides.\n\nIt has been suggested that the piece is associated with the metaphorical use of the word albatross to mean a wearisome burden. The use of the word \"Albatross\" to mean an encumbrance around somebody's neck is an allusion to Coleridge's poem \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" (1798). It is unclear whether Fleetwood Mac intended the title to reference this meaning or if it refers to the bird; but the title of the album it appears on, The Pious Bird of Good Omen, alludes to and quotes from the Coleridge poem.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fleetwood+Mac/_/Albatross\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song reached #7 on the U.S. charts, #37 in the U.K., #11 in Australia and #2 in Canada. The extended version of the song runs for 6:27 on the Tusk album.\n\nCommenting on the track in interview, Stevie Nicks says that the track is about her best friend Sara Recor Fleetwood, the wife of Mick Fleetwood and the effect she had on relationships within the band during 1978.\n\nNicks herself had an affair with Mick Fleetwood in early 1978 while he was married to Jenny Boyd. Then her best friend, model Sara Recor (at the time married to music manager Jim Recor), fell for Fleetwood and began an affair with him whilst Nicks and Fleetwood were still together. The pair ultimately moved in together, and were subsequently married. Nicks felt very betrayed, but Recor and Fleetwood were undeniably in love. Sara Fleetwood has stated that Nicks and Fleetwood were no longer together when they began their affair, at least that is what Mick told Sara. \"Sara\" was actually written with Sara Recor sitting by Nicks at the piano. Sara claims that Nicks was never upset with her, only with Fleetwood.\n\n\"Sara\" originally had many more verses and ran for 16 minutes in demo form, according to Nicks, and referenced all Fleetwood Mac band members. The song was a commentary on all the tangled relationships and love affairs that were occurring in 1977-1978, but the final recorded version omitted most of this and focused on the triangle between Nicks, Fleetwood and Recor.\n\nNicks wrote the track on a piano, and it was very hard for Mick Fleetwood to put a drum track together for it. He used brushes to make it work.\n\nNicks has stated in interviews that the line \"When you build your house/I'll come by\" was about Don Henley, who was actually building a house at the time, and also that the lyric \"and he was just like a great dark wing\" was a reference to Mick Fleetwood.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fleetwood+Mac/_/Sara\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Recorded with stereo gear on background photo."}, "description": "\"Black Magic Woman\" is a song written by Peter Green that first appeared as a Fleetwood Mac single in various countries in 1968, subsequently appearing on the 1969 Fleetwood Mac compilation albums English Rose (US) and The Pious Bird of Good Omen (UK). It became a classic hit by Santana and sung by Gregg Rolie in 1970, reaching #4 in the U.S. and Canadian charts, after appearing on their Abraxas album, becoming more closely associated with Santana than Fleetwood Mac. In 2005 the song was covered by ex-Thin Lizzy guitarist Snowy White on his album The Way It Is. In 1996 the song was also covered by Gary Hoey on his album Bug Alley .\n\nAlthough not nearly as popular as Santana's arrangement two years later, \"Black Magic Woman\" nevertheless became a fairly popular blues-rock hit peaking at #37 in the UK Singles Chart. It was featured in Fleetwood Mac live set-lists even after Green had left the band, when it was often sung by Danny Kirwan, and during concerts in the early 1970s it would form the basis for long mid-concert jams. The song would often be preceded by a band member reminding the audience that it was a Fleetwood Mac song before it became such a big hit for Santana.\n\nSet in the key of D minor, the verse follows a twelve bar chord progression alternating between D minor7, A minor7, and G minor7, and the instrumentation consists of vocals, two guitars, bass guitar and drums. It is homophonic, the voice and lead guitar taking the lead roles, and set in common time (4/4), with the rhythm \"pushing\" on the upbeat, then breaking into a shuffle beat root - chord jam after the final verse.\n\nD minor 7 | D minor 7 | A minor 7 | A minor 7 | D minor 7 | D minor 7 | G minor 7 | G minor 7 | Dm 7 - C 7 | Bb 7 - A 7 | D minor 7 | D minor 7\n\nIt can also be noted that the origional recording by Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac featured guitars that were slightly below standard pitch, probably due to them being tuned to a piano or another guitar in the recording studio (very much reminiscent of The Rolling Stones). For most performances, it is played in standard, although to create a performance faithful to the origional recording, the low E string is advised to be tuned down to D.\n\nIt also believed that the haunting D triad from the 17 fret is played out on one guitar, and a slide guitar playing the same chord is faded in over the top. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fleetwood+Mac/_/Black+Magic+Woman\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

From the band's inception through the end of 1974, no incarnation of Fleetwood Mac lasted longer than two years, but all featured core members Mick Fleetwood and John McVie. Their two most successful periods have been during the late 60s British blues boom, when they were led by guitarist/singer-songwriter Peter Green, and from 1975 to 1987, when they went a pop-oriented direction with musicians Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham, and Stevie Nicks.\n\nThe band enjoyed more modest success in the intervening period between 1971 and 1974, with a line-up that included Bob Welch, and also during the 90s, which saw more personnel changes before the return of Nicks and Buckingham in 1997. More recently, the departure of Christine McVie from Fleetwood Mac in 1998 shifted around the group's plans for many years. McVie returned to the fold in 2014 and a coming tour featuring the reunited line-up is in the works.\n\nThe only member present in the band from the very beginning is its namesake drummer Mick Fleetwood. Bassist John McVie, despite his giving part of his name to the band, did not play on their first single nor at their first concerts. Keyboardist Christine McVie has, to date, appeared on all but two albums, either as a member or as a session musician. She also supplied the artwork for the album 'Kiln House'.\n\nThe band was started in London in 1967 by guitarist Peter Green, who recruited the rhythm section of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers: drummer Mick Fleetwood and bass guitarist John McVie. Green himself had replaced a departing member, Eric Clapton, as the lead guitarist of the \"Bluesbreakers;\" Green and McVie had appeared on John Mayall's 1967 A Hard Road album. The band employed another bassist, Bob Brunning, until John McVie was persuaded to join the band. (The band's first album Fleetwood Mac contains one song with Brunning on bass.) Slide-guitarist and Elmore James devotee, Jeremy Spencer, rounded out the lineup.\n\nAfter its second album, Mr. Wonderful, a third guitarist, 18-year-old Danny Kirwan, was added to the lineup. At this point the band began shifting into a more melodic, introspective, and experimental/progressive mode. Most performances were built around the twin leads of Green and Kirwan, and Kirwan's songwriting was featured in nearly equal proportion to Green's. After releasing two successful singles, the instrumental \"Albatross\" (which remains the band's only #1 hit in the UK), and the ballad \"Man of the World\" [#2 UK], it produced what is often considered the best album of the band's Peter Green era, Then Play On. Spencer was, for the most part, absent from these recording sessions. The epic 2-part \"Oh Well\" single followed [#2 UK], and was included in later pressings of the U.S. LP album (and in all CDs). The band was then rocked by Peter Green's decision to leave. Debate rages on the reasons for this, but it is agreed that Green wished to play a more experimental and improvisational style. Drugs, particularly LSD, also played a large part, as Green recorded sporadically before falling into a twenty-year period of mental illness. After a short gap, Christine McVie (a.k.a. under her maiden name Christine Perfect) joined the band on keyboards, and the band moved from the blues to a more melodic pop style.\n\nThe early 1970s of Fleetwood Mac were turbulent for the band, which gained and lost members at a troubling rate. Jeremy Spencer disappeared during an American tour, and was found to have joined the controversial Children of God cult. American guitarist Bob Welch joined up, at the suggestion of good friend Judy Wong, lending a jazz-rock flavor to Kirwan's more melodic songs. Kirwan's and Welch's tenures overlapped by two albums, but eventually, Kirwan's own erratic behavior on tour led to his dismissal in late 1972. Welch's contributions included \"Future Games\" (from 1971's Future Games), \"Sentimental Lady\" (from 1972's Bare Trees), and \"Hypnotized\" (from 1973's Mystery To Me).\n\nBob Weston (guitar) and Savoy Brown's Dave Walker (vocals) were also briefly hired during this phase of the band. Walker was fired after just one album, but the firing of Weston, for an alleged affair with Mick Fleetwood's wife, during a late 1973 tour led to that tour's abrupt cancellation. This led its manager, Clifford Davis, to send another dummy band out on the road billed as \"Fleetwood Mac,\" but featuring no original members of the band, resulting in a year-long legal battle. The fake Fleetwood Mac scored one hit a couple of years later (\"Why Did You Do It?\") under their new name Stretch\n\nIn late 1974, Welch indicated that he intended to leave the band, and Fleetwood and John McVie needed to fill the possible vacancy. While Fleetwood was scouting Van Nuys, California's Sound City Studios, house engineer Keith Olsen played a track titled \"Frozen Love,\" which he had mixed there for an obscure American duo, Buckingham Nicks. Fleetwood liked what he heard, and he was introduced to the guitarist, Lindsey Buckingham, who just happened to be in the building. When Welch resigned from the band, Fleetwood asked Buckingham to join. Buckingham agreed, on the condition that his musical partner and girlfriend, Stevie Nicks, also become part of the band.\n\nIn 1975, under new management by Gabriele Arras, the new lineup released the eponymous Fleetwood Mac (otherwise known as The White Album). This proved to be a breakthrough for the band and it became a huge hit. The band was catapulted into stardom. Among the hit singles from this album were Christine McVie's \"Over My Head\" and \"Say You Love Me,\" and Stevie Nicks's \"Rhiannon (Will You Ever Win).\"\n\nBut in 1976, with the success of the band also came the end of John and Christine McVie's marriage, as well as Buckingham's and Nicks's longtime romantic relationship. Pressure was put on Fleetwood Mac to release a successful follow-on album, which, when combined with its new-found wealth, led to creative and personal tensions, fuelled by large amounts of drug and alcohol consumption, especially cocaine.\n\nThe album the band members created was Rumours in 1977, in which the band lays bare the emotional turmoil experienced at that time. It became the best- selling album of the year, and it sold over 19 million copies worldwide by 1998. The RIAA certified Rumours as a diamond album.\n\nThis lineup of the band continued to record for over a decade. Their 1979 album Tusk was a double album, more experimental in tone, still spawning three hit singles but selling nowhere near the quantity of Rumours.  After solo albums by Nicks and Buckingham, 1982's Mirage was a return to more commercial pop, but still didn't reproduce the success of Rumours.  The band went on hiatus, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham continuing solo careers and Christine McVie issuing a solo album as well.\n\nIn 1987, the band reconvened for Tango In The Night, some of which was originally destined for another Buckingham solo disc. The disc sold well and had several hit singles, but Buckingham refused to tour with the band and they parted ways acrimoniously. Buckingham was replaced with Rick Vito and Billy Burnette for the Tango In The Night tour, and this new lineup recorded the 1990 album Behind The Mask, which did not enjoy much commercial success. In 1991, Nicks and Vito announced they were leaving the band. Bekka Bramlett joined, and this lineup eventually recorded the unsuccessful album Time in 1995.\n\nIn 1997, the \"classic\" Rumours line-up reunited for an MTV reunion special called The Dance. The live album sold over 5 million copies in the United States and spawned a 40-city tour. Following The Dance, Christine McVie retired from the band permanently, and the remaining four (Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, John McVie, and Mick Fleetwood) produced a new album released in 2003 called Say You Will. The new album included 18 new songs written by Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. They then went on an 18-month worldwide tour over the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe.\n\nIn interviews given in November 2006 to support his solo album, Under The Skin, Buckingham stated that there were plans for the band to reunite once more for a 2008 tour but recording plans had been put on hold for the foreseeable future. In a September 2007 interview Stevie Nicks gave to the UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph, she noted that she is unwilling to carry on with the band unless Christine McVie returns. However in a recent interview, Mick Fleetwood said \"...be very happy and hopeful that we will be working again. I can tell you everyone's going to be extremely excited about what's happening with Fleetwood Mac.\"\n\nOn June 9, 2008, The New York Times reported that Irving Azoff is in the process of negotiating a deal with Wal-Mart for Fleetwood Mac's new album. The article states \"Mr. Azoff said that he was already talking to Wal-Mart about an exclusive deal for Fleetwood Mac\u2019s next release. 'Classic rock really works there,' Mr. Azoff said.\"\n\nAccording to Stevie Nicks, \"the group will start working on material and recording probably in October, and finish an album.\"\n\nHowever, instead of returning to the studio, the band instead went back out on the road in 2009 for a greatest hits tour called \"Fleetwood Mac Unleashed,\" the first time the band have gone out on tour without an album to support. The tour saw the band play throughout the United States as well as returning, for the first time in years, to play dates in Canada, Europe, and the UK.\n\nOn January 11, 2014, Mick Fleetwood announced that Christine McVie would be rejoining Fleetwood Mac, and the news was confirmed on January 13.\n\nwww.fleetwoodmac.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fleetwood+Mac\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

First on the agenda is a song called \"Finesse\". \"There's just some things fucking the groove up,\" he says, \"Anytime you see us, on tour, on TV, I want to be moving... I was very conscious on this album of the bounce.\"\nMars opens his laptop and pulls up the latest version- the 20th or so, he guesses. He threw out one where he sang about gold chains and cognac over a silky beat (too corny), and another for sounding too much \"like a Seventies cop show - like I should be on roller skates.\"\nThis version he's finally happy with; he just needs to fix the bridge. There's something bugging him about the harmonies, or maybe the chord progression. \"I don't know what's not hitting home. There's just something weird that I ain't fucking with yet.\" He jabs at his Korg keyboard in frustration. \"I just have to open it up.\"  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bruno+Mars/_/Finesse\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He is most well known for his hit Just The Way You Are, which went #1 in 9 countries in 2010. He is also known for singing/co-writing the hooks for the #1 hit Nothin' On You by B.o.B, and Billionaire by Travie McCoy; he also co-wrote the international hits Right Round by Flo Rida and Wavin' Flag by K'naan.\n\nAfter the success of the songs he featured on, Mars released his debut EP, It\u2019s Better If You Don\u2019t Understand, in May 2010. \n\nHe then released his debut album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, on October 5th, which features special guest appearances from B.o.B, Cee-Lo Green, and Damian Marley.  The lead single, Just the Way You Are, was released on July 19, 2010.  The second single off the album, Grenade, was released on September 2010 as a promotional single but was eventually shifted to official second single. The It Will Rain Songfacts reports that in 2011 he recorded \"It Will Rain,\" the lead single from the soundtrack to the movie The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 1. It was released exclusively on iTunes September 27, 2011.\n\nBruno Mars was born and raised in the Waikiki neighborhood of Honolulu, Hawaii by parents Pete and Bernadette \"Bernie\" Hernandez, of Puerto Rican and Filipino descent. Hernandez was one of six children and came from a musical family giving him a diverse mix of reggae, rock, hip hop, and R&B. From a young age, he was impersonating and performing songs by artists such as Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, The Isley Brothers, and The Temptations. In 1990, Hernandez was featured in MidWeek as \"Little Elvis\", going on to have a cameo in Honeymoon in Vegas in 1992. \"I watch the best. I'm a big fan of Elvis. I'm a big fan of 1950s Elvis when he would go on stage and scare people because he was a force and girls would go nuts! You can say the same thing for Prince or The Police. It's just guys who know that people are here to see a show, so I watch those guys and I love studying them because I'm a fan,\" he stated.\n\nIn 2010 he said, \"Growing up in Hawaii made me the man I am. I used to do a lot of shows in Hawaii with my father's band. Everybody in my family sings, everyone plays instruments. My uncle's an incredible guitar player, my dad's an incredible percussionist, my brother's a great drummer, he actually plays in our band. I've just been surrounded by it.\" He attended President Theodore Roosevelt High School, graduating in 2003 at the age of seventeen, and shortly after moved to Los Angeles, California to pursue a musical career.\n\nBefore becoming a successful solo artist, Hernandez was an acknowledged music producer, writing songs for Alexandra Burke, Travie McCoy, Adam Levine, Brandy, and Sean Kingston, as well as Flo Rida's international hit \"Right Round\". He also co-wrote the Sugababes' hit song \"Get Sexy\" and provided backing vocals on their album Sweet 7. His first musical appearance as a singer was in Far East Movement's second studio album Animal, featured on the track \"3D\". He reached prominence as a solo artist after being featured on and co-writing B.o.B's \"Nothin' on You\" and Travie McCoy's \"Billionaire\"; both songs peaked within the top ten of many charts worldwide. He said of them, \"I think those songs weren't meant to be full-sung songs. If I'd sung all of \"Nothin' on You\", it might've sounded like some '90s R&B.\" Following this success, Mars released his debut extended play (EP), titled It's Better If You Don't Understand, on May 11, 2010. The EP peaked at the ninety-ninth position on the Billboard 200 and produced one single: \"The Other Side\", featuring rappers Cee Lo Green and B.o.B. He performed a medley of \"Nothin' on You\" and \"Airplanes\" with B.o.B and Hayley Williams at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, 2010.\n\nHe opened for Maroon 5 on the fall leg of the Hands All Over Tour which began on October 6, 2010. Mars also co-headlined with Travie McCoy on a European tour that started on October 18, 2010.\n\nOn September 19, 2010, Mars was arrested in Las Vegas for possession of cocaine. He claims \"he has never used drugs before\" and his decision was \"foolish\".\n\nHe has been nominated for seven 2011 Grammy Awards. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bruno+Mars\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released on January 12, 2004, by Jive Records as the second single from the album. Co-written and produced by Bloodshy & Avant, the song was initially offered to Kylie Minogue, but she rejected it. Spears has named \"Toxic\" as her favorite song from her career, and originally had to convince her record label to release it as a single. \"Toxic\" is a dance-pop song with influences of electropop and bhangra music, that features varied instrumentation, such as drums, synthesizers and surf guitar. It is accompanied by high-pitched strings and breathy vocals. Its lyrics refer to being addicted to a lover. The song was well received by critics, who deemed it as the strongest track of In the Zone, while praising its hook and chorus.\n\n\"Toxic\" attained worldwide success, reaching the top-five in fifteen countries, while topping the charts in Australia, Canada, Hungary, Norway and the United Kingdom. In the United States, it became her first single to peak inside the top ten in almost four years. The accompanying music video for the song was directed by Joseph Kahn and features references to Blade Runner, The Seven Year Itch and the films of John Woo. It portrays Spears as a secret agent in the search of a vial of green liquid. After she steals it, she enters an apartment and poisons her unfaithful boyfriend. The video also includes interspersed scenes of Spears naked with diamonds over her body. After Janet Jackson's Superbowl incident, the video was considered too racy for MTV and was moved to late-night programming.\n\nSpears has performed \"Toxic\" in a number of live appearances, including the 2004 NRJ Music Awards and in three of her concert tours. It was the opening number of The Onyx Hotel Tour (2004), where she sang atop of a bus wearing a black catsuit; Spears also performed remixed versions of the song at The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009) and the Femme Fatale Tour (2011). \"Toxic\" has been covered by artists such as Mark Ronson, Yael Na\u00efm and A Static Lullaby, and in television series Glee. The song has also appeared in feature films such as Knocked Up, You Again and television series Doctor Who.\n\n\"Toxic\" won Spears her first Grammy at the 2005 ceremony in the category of Best Dance Recording, while gaining her credibility amongst critics. The song has been included in lists by Pitchfork, NME and Rolling Stone as one of the best songs of the decade. It has been noted for redefining the sound of dance-pop music. \"Toxic\" is also considered one of the defining songs for Spears. The music video is also known for showing Spears for the first time as a confident adult woman, comfortable with her own sexuality.\n\n\"Toxic\" was written by Cathy Dennis, Henrik Jonback and by Christian Karlsson and Pontus Winnberg from Bloodshy & Avant, while produced by the latter two.[1] The song was originally offered to Kylie Minogue for her 2003 studio album Body Language, but she rejected it. Minogue later commented, \"I wasn't at all angry when it worked for her. It's like the fish that got away. You just have to accept it.\"[2] \"Toxic\" was recorded at Murlyn Studios in Stockholm, Sweden and Record Plant in Hollywood, California. The song was later mixed by Niklas Flyckt at Khabang Studios in Stockholm.[1] In December 2003, it was announced that after trying to choose between \"(I Got That) Boom Boom\" and \"Outrageous\" to be second single from In the Zone, Spears had selected \"Toxic\" instead.[3] She described it as \"an upbeat song. It's really different, that's why I like it so much.\"[4] In May 2010, Spears revealed through her Twitter account that \"Toxic\" was her favorite song from her catalogue.[5]\n\n\"Toxic\" is a dance-pop song with elements of electropop and bhangra music.[6][7] It features varied instrumentation, such as drums, synthesizers, strings and surf guitar, that according to Caryn Ganz of Spin, \"warps and struts like it\u2019s been fed into the Matrix.\" The music was also compared to the soundtrack of the James Bond film series.[8] \"Toxic\"'s hook samples a portion of \"Tere Mere Beech Mein\", from the soundtrack of the 1981 Hindi film Ek Duje Ke Liye.[9] Spence D. of IGN described the song as a mix of \"swirling, high-pitched faux strings, and Brit's breathy vocal pulse\".[10] According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, \"Toxic\" is composed in the key of E\u266d major, with a tempo of 144 beats per minute. Spears's vocal range spans from the high-tone of G3 to the low-tone of F5.[11] Lyrically, \"Toxic\" talks about being addicted to a lover.[12] Spears refers to her addiction in the lyrics \"Too high / Can't come down / It's in my head spinning round and round.\" \"Toxic\" ends with an outro in which Spears sings the lines, \"Intoxicate me now / With your lovin' now / I think I'm ready now.\"[13] Nick Southall of Stylus Magazine said the lyrics made Spears sound afraid of sex.[14]\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Britney+Spears/_/Toxic\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The single was released in October of 1998 and quickly climbed to the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1999, where it stayed for two weeks.  Internationally, the single reached number one in every country that it charted, including the United Kingdom,  France, Australia, and Spain.  \n\nAccording to the ...Baby One More Time Songfacts, when Spears went on her first world tour, this was a centerpiece of the show, with two cannons at the front of the stage blasting confetti all over fans in the first few rows. The tour was a showcase for Spears' dancing, which critics appreciated a lot more than her singing.\n\n...Baby One More Time was accompanied by a music video, in which Britney wore several different outfits and performed various choreography to the song.  The video takes place in a high school, where Britney and her classmates are waiting for the end of the day.  Once the bell rings, the song starts and the dancing begins.  Total Request Live (TRL) declared ...Baby One More the single most iconic video of the TRL-era during its final episode, making ...Baby One More Time the final video played on the program.  \n\nCurrently, ...Baby One More Time is Britney's first of five number one hits during her career(the others being Womanizer, 3, Hold It Against Me and the remix of S&M).

It is the second single (except in France where it hasn't been released) from Spears' fifth studio album .\n\nThe song was successful reaching number one in South Africa, Ireland and Brazil. It was also successful in clubs, reaching number one in various Dance Club Play charts, including in the United States and in Australia. It was also one of her most successful singles in the UK, peaking at a high number two, and staying in the top seventy-five for twenty-nine consecutive weeks. \n\nAlthough Spears was not credited as writer of the song, her A&R rep, Teresa LaBarbera Whites, stated that she was involved in the songs and how they turned out. In this song, Britney responds to the obsessive media attention she receives by listing the violations for which the American Pop singer has been cited. In 2007, Spears had some very public meltdowns and provided lots of content for gossip magazines and entertainment television shows. She has a very defiant attitude in this song, explaining that she's still successful despite the constant harassment and the challenges of raising children. Despite her personal struggles, this song and the Blackout album did very well.  In a radio interview with Ryan Seacrest, Spears said of the song: \"wherever you go there's a lot of people who ask questions and sometimes you don't know their intentions and stuff like that. So, it's kind of a cute way of putting it out there you know like, 'You want a piece of me', you know in a cool, cute and clever way. It's a cute song... I like it.\" \n\nSwedish pop singer Robyn originally recorded a demo of this song after Klas \u00c5hlund wrote it, then when Britney recorded the song, Robyn's original vocals were kept as background. The track was produced by Bloodshy & Avant, who produced Spears' Grammy Award-winning single \"Toxic\".\n\nThe catchy upbeat, electro 'Piece Of Me' hit No.2 in the UK charts in Jan 2008, giving Britney her 20th UK hit single. The song, produced by the 'Toxic' team of Bloodshy and Avant, is about the media circus that constantly surrounds her and was voted one of 'Rolling Stone' magazine's best songs of the year for 2007. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Britney+Spears/_/Piece+of+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was recorded for her fifth album, Blackout. The song was written during her second pregnancy and features racy lyrics backed with breathy vocals and uptempo beats.\n\nOn recording the album with Britney, Danja talks about \"Gimme More.\"  \"It's a lot of negativity on her sometimes and you can't forget who she is, and that's kind of what I wanted to state at the end of the song [\"Gimme More\"], this is who, she is a legend, regardless you're gonna love her. We've been in and out of the studio for, like a year. I don't know it was real, real calm I think for everybody at that point, and we was able to get in and really focus on the recording. She wanna dance, she wanna dance, she wanna dance, she wanna dance, she wanna dance. She wanna be in the club, she wanna dance, that's all she wanted to say, she just wanted up-tempo, high-energy music and that's what we did. We did about five of 'em, so, we did a bunch of ideas but we got about four or five strong ones and I'm excited about 'em, the label's excited about 'em, they're excited, and ready to unleash it.\"\n\n\"Gimme More\" was a commercial success with radio stations and digital stores during its pre-singles release. Announced as the lead single from the album, \"Gimme More\" was first released in Australia on October 6, 2007. It performed well, reaching the top ten on many international charts. \"Gimme More\" topped Billboard's Canadian chart and reached number three in the US Billboard Hot 100, making it Spears' highest-peaking single in the United States since her 1999 number-one debut \"...Baby One More Time\". It also peaked at number three in Australia and the United Kingdom.

Written by Nate \"Danja\" Hills, Marcella \"Ms. Lago\" Araica, Keri Hilson and James Washington, it was produced by Danja for Spears' fifth studio album, Blackout. The track was released as the third and final single from the album in the first quarter of 2008. \n\nSome critics have suggested that this would have been a more suitable album lead-off track than \"Gimme More ,\" since in this song, Spears re-introduces herself at the top and apologizes for being gone for so long.  This track has a second meaning where Spears is apologizing for being away so long from her love interest. The song's co-writer Keri Hilson told MTV Canada News: \"It's about two people, a girl and a guy, and the girl is saying, 'You're a little cold. Let me warm things up and break the ice.' \" She added that she was amazed at Spears' work ethic: \"When we were arranging the vocals in the studio at her house, she was about eight months pregnant, and she was standing up in the vocal booth, just banging it out. Three weeks later, she had the baby.\"\n\nThe music video, Spears' first animated one, features the singer as an animated superhero in a futuristic world. It was made in South Korea in Japanese anime style. The song has topped several Dance Club Play charts, including Billboard in the United States and in Australia.\n\n'Break The Ice' was the third single release from Britney's fifth studio album 'Blackout' and hit the UK charts in April 2008. It followed two monster singles 'Gimme More' & 'Piece Of Me' and was her 21st UK hit single. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Britney+Spears/_/Break+the+Ice\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released as the first single from her seventh studio album, titled \"Femme Fatale\". \"Hold It Against Me\" was written by Max Martin, Dr. Luke, Bonnie McKee and Billboard, while being produced by Luke, Martin and Billboard. Musically, \"Hold It Against Me\" features industrial beats, a dubstep-influenced breakdown and a final chorus with elements of rave. The lyrics portray the singer seducing someone on the dancefloor, while the chorus revolves around pick-up lines. \n  \n\"Hold It Against Me\" has received positive reviews from most critics. Such as, Rick Florino of Artistdirect gave the song four and half stars, calling it \"one of Britney's catchiest club bangers yet\" and saying \"[it] proudly stands alongside Britney classics like 'Womanizer,' 'Gimme More,' and 'Toxic,' but there's a refined ethereal elegance to it that sees Britney stepping into new territory and pushing the boundaries of dance pop once more.\"\n  \nAfter its release, \"Hold It Against Me\" set the record for most radio plays in one day in the United States, registering 619 plays on Mediabase and 595 plays on Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems (BDS). It also broke Mediabase's one-week play's record, with 3,866 spins. The following week, \"Hold It Against Me\" debuted at number sixteen on Billboard's Pop Songs chart with 4,071 plays, the highest detections total by a new entry in the chart's history. It was also tied with Madonna's \"Frozen\" (1998) for the second highest debut. Billboard reported that \"Hold It Against Me\" was likely to debut at the top of the Billboard Hot 100, due to the strong airplay and sales, which were expected to exceed 400,000 copies. On the issue dated January 29, 2011, \"Hold It Against Me\" debuted at number one on the Hot 100, making Spears the second artist in history to debut multiple songs at the top of the chart, only behind Mariah Carey. The single is also the eighteenth song to debut at number one, and Spears' fourth chart-topper. \"Hold It Against Me\" also debuted atop of the Hot Digital Songs chart, with 411,000 copies sold. The sum marks the highest debut sales by a female artist, surpassing the record previously held by Taylor Swift's \"Today Was a Fairytale\" (2010). It is also Spears' biggest one-week digital sales total, as well as the fourth biggest first-week sales tally in digital history.\n\nBritney's career technically now spans over three decades (debut single '...Baby One More Time' was released back in 1999!), and she's just racked up her twenty-sixth UK top twenty success with 'Hold It Against Me'.

It was written and produced by Max Martin and Shellback, with additional writing by Savan Kotecha. Spears first posted a snippet of the track in February 2011, prior to the album's release. Following a poll on her official website in which fans could choose the third single of the album, \"I Wanna Go\" was announced as a single on May 13, 2011.\n\n\"I Wanna Go\" is a dance and Hi-NRG song that features a heavy bassline and drum fills reminiscent of New Order. The pre-chorus has a whistled hook that received comparisons to the music of Bob Sinclar and Frankie Knuckles. Spears' vocals are processed, and she squeals and stutters throughout the song. The lyrics of \"I Wanna Go\" feature Spears singing about losing inhibitions. The song received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Some praised it for being effective and highlighted its hook, while others dismissed the processed vocals. The song was treated with different remixes, including a Bollywood mix with guest vocals by Sonu Nigam, and another one by DJ Frank E and Alex Dreamz.\n\nAfter the release of Femme Fatale, \"I Wanna Go\" charted due to digital sales in the lower regions of the US Billboard Hot 100 and the Canadian Hot 100, and also topped the South Korean International chart. Following its release as a single, the song reached the top ten in several music markets, including Canada, France, Finland and the United States. However, it became one of her lowest peaking singles in countries such as Australia and New Zealand, and was the first single of her career that failed to chart in the United Kingdom. In the United States, \"I Wanna Go\" made Femme Fatale the first album by Spears to have three top ten singles.\n\nAn accompanying music video for the song, directed by Chris Marrs Piliero, premiered on June 22, 2011. It depicts Spears daydreaming at a press conference about a series of events, including being chased by paparazzi cyborgs and being rescued by actor Guillermo D\u00edaz. Piliero explained the video as \"a ridiculous, exaggerated rumor about her life and career.\" The video references films such as Half Baked, Crossroads, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and Michael Jackson's Thriller. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised its fun spirit. Spears has performed \"I Wanna Go\" at the Femme Fatale Tour (2011). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Britney+Spears/_/I+Wanna+Go\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released on March 27, 2000, by JIVE Records as the lead single from the album. The song was written and produced by Max Martin and Rami Yacoub. \"Oops!... I Did It Again\" is a song that lyrically speaks of a female who views love as a game, and she decides to use that to her advantage by playing with her lover's emotions. Its bridge features a dialogue which references the blockbuster film Titanic (1997).\n\nUpon its release, \"Oops!... I Did It Again\" received positive reviews from music critics, who noted similarities to her debut single \"...Baby One More Time\". It was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance during the 2001 ceremony. Commercially, the track peaked at number nine on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. It went to the top of more than 15 countries, and remains one of the best-selling singles of all time, with over 4 million copies sold.\n\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Nigel Dick. It depicts Spears on Mars, where she addresses an astronaut who has fallen in love with her. She is dressed in a red catsuit. It went on to receive three nominations at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. Spears has performed the track during her Oops!...

It was written and produced by Bloodshy & Avant and The Clutch in November 2006 as a record that did not relate to any of her personal problems at the time. The recording sessions took place the day after Spears filed for divorce from Kevin Federline, and members of The Clutch claimed to be surprised by her work ethic. \"Radar\" was originally planned to be released as the third single from Blackout, but \"Break the Ice\" was released instead. The song was then planned as the fourth single; in July 2008, a CD single was released in some countries, but a wider release was cancelled. \"Radar\" was later included as a bonus track on her sixth studio album Circus, and was released in June 2009 as the fourth single from that album.\n\nMusically, \"Radar\" is an electropop and synthpop song, that runs through a midtempo dance groove. Spears' vocals are auto tuned and accompanied by sonar pulses and a heavy usage of distorted synthesizers. The song is influenced by the works of Rihanna. The lyrics refer to an attraction between the protagonist and a man, while she wonders if he knows what she is feeling. \"Radar\" received mixed reviews from critics; some called it one of the highlights of Blackout, while others felt that it was over-produced and also criticized her vocals for being processed. In July 2008, \"Radar\" charted in the top forty of Ireland and New Zealand, and inside the top-ten in Sweden. After it was released as a single from Circus, the track performed poorly on the charts and did not manage to enter the top forty in most countries. However, it became her 21st hit on the US Billboard's Pop Songs chart, the most for any artist of the decade.\n\nThe single's accompanying music video was directed by Dave Meyers, and pays tribute to the music video of Madonna's \"Take a Bow\" (1994). In the video, Spears is an aristocratic woman involved in a love triangle with two men who are polo players. The video received mixed reviews from critics, who complimented the fashion but called the idea unoriginal. \"Radar\" was performed by Spears at The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009), with the accompanying dance routine featuring her pole dancing. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Britney+Spears/_/Radar\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In the United States, the song was expected to reach number one[citation needed], but peaked at number 23 in the Hot 100, and at number nine in the Pop Songs chart. \"Lucky\" received several certifications around the world, from Silver to Platinum.

Spears recorded her vocals for the song in November 1999 at Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. Audio mixing and programming was done by Martin and Rami. Esbj\u00f6rn \u00d6hrwall played the guitar, while background vocals were provided by Spears, Martin and Nana Hedin. \"Lucky\" was released on August 8, 2000 by Jive Records as the second single from the album.

With just\u00a0half a semester left of business school, breakout artist\u00a0DJ Vanic\u00a0did exactly that when he decided to pursue a full-time career in music. Without knowing exactly what it would lead to, the Vancouver based producer took a chance and boy did it pay off.&quot;Family and personal issues came up in my life that\u00a0made me re-evaluate my goals and direction,&quot; Vanic told\u00a0Forbes.com. &quot;I decided that I might as well spend my youth trying for something really cool and different, something I was passionate about. And music was the obvious choice, it&#39;s been one of the biggest parts of my life since I was 3 years old.&quot;\u00a0In as little as two years,\u00a0Vanic quickly made his mark. He took the festival circuit by storm and already managed to play the coveted\u00a0Coachella\u00a0music festival last year.\u00a0You&#39;re probably one of the millions of people who had his remix of Zella Day&#39;s hit single &quot;Hypnotic&quot; on repeat, which he dropped a few months ahead of his debut in the desert. Since then,\u00a0he&#39;s released originals of his own, including his latest track featuring Clara Mae &quot;Staring At the Sun,&quot;\u00a0which exudes the same high-energy as his live sets.\u00a0&quot;Clara sent over the vocal and I fell in love with it,&quot; he shared. &quot;The whole process took probably over a year though, because we kept changing the drop style and re-writing verses. As with any song I work on, it&#39;s the vocal itself that usually inspires me \u2014 whatever the singer makes me feel, I try to replicate that in the music.&quot;\u00a0\u00a0Though it appears his success happened overnight, that certainly wasn&#39;t the case. Vanic opened up\u00a0about how he&#39;s nowhere near where he wants to be skill wise and the importance of continuing to hustle.\u00a0&quot;I&#39;ve never claimed to be an amazing DJ,&quot; he humbly said. &quot;It&#39;s hard to keep creating music that is true to my own sound, but still unique and not repetitive. Though it&#39;s a challenge, I love the struggle behind it, otherwise I wouldn&#39;t be doing it.&quot;\u00a0A stepping stone that propelled his career was the moment\u00a0he signed onto Disruptor Records, the label headed by\u00a0The Chainsmokers&#39; manager, Adam Alpert. Vanic&#39;s own manager\u00a0Sebastian Barwinski (The Standard Group)\u00a0encouraged him to take that next step\u00a0and has backed Vanic\u00a0ever since he decided to make the move. &quot;\u00a0I have a really amazing team of people who help ensure everything in my life and business as Vanic falls into place,&quot; he revealed. &quot;Adam and Disruptor were the right fit. Everything they do seems to be spot on, and they&#39;re really good people to work with.&quot;\u00a0Up next, you can expect\u00a0way more new music from EDM&#39;s rising star. &quot;I have a couple remixes and a few more originals all being wrapped up,&quot; Vanic confirmed. &quot;I&#39;m hoping to release all of them throughout the summer and fall. Then I&#39;ll spend the rest of the time playing, traveling, DJ-ing, and hitting up festivals. After that we will be getting into another full headline tour across North America.&quot;\u00a0Vanic recently\u00a0played Houston&#39;s\u00a0Free Press Summer Fest\u00a0last\u00a0weekend and is scheduled to perform at\u00a0this weekend&#39;s Bonnaroo along with\u00a0Made in America later this year, where he&#39;ll be reunited with The Chainsmokers who are headlining the Philadelphia based event. However, I\u00a0have a feeling there&#39;s plenty more where that came from, this is hands down just the beginning.- FORBES\u00a0\u00a0", "title": "Vanic - Black Masquerade", "url": "http://anchorage.eventful.com/events/vanic-black-masquerade-/E0-001-110594666-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Williwaw", "date": "2018-03-02 21:00:00"}, {"city": "San Francisco", "description": " Never miss a Britney Spears dance class!\u00a0 We&#39;re going to be adding more Britney Spears to the PopStar Booty Camp repertoire, and we want to make sure you&#39;re informed.\u00a0 Here&#39;s the thing - be sure to input your email address PeRfECtlY or you won&#39;t receive notification emails.\u00a0 Eventbrite doesn&#39;t scan for errors, so it&#39;s up to you to make sure you input your addy correctly.

She debuted in 1998 with her single ...Baby One More Time. She is one of the most influential and popular post-2000 icons of music. Spears is one of the few young musicians to appear on lists of best selling music acts of all-time. She also holds several world records.\n\nShe has officially released nine studio albums to date:\"...Baby One More Time\" (1999), \"Oops!...I Did It Again\" (2000), \"Britney\" (2001), \"In the Zone\" (2003), \"Blackout\" (2007), \"Circus\" (2008), \"Femme Fatale\" (2011), \"Britney Jean\"(2013), \"Glory\" (2016).\n\nAlong with 2 official compilation albums, 2 official remixes albums and 1 official extended play: \"Greatest Hits: My Prerogative\" (2004), \"B In The Mix: The Remixes\" (2005), \"Britney & Kevin: Chaotic\" (2005), \"The Singles Collection\" (2009) and  \"B in the Mix: The Remixes Vol. 2\" (2011).\n\nAs a child, Spears performed as a cast member of The New Mickey Mouse Club from 1993 to 1994, along with Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera.\n\nIn September 2004, she married Kevin Federline. The couple had two sons, Sean (born September 2005) and Jayden (born September 2006). Spears filed for divorce in November 2006.\n\nBritney's debut album' ...Baby One More Time' was a huge commercial success. It debuted at number one in the U.S. with 120,500 copies sold in its first week on the Billboard 200, where it remained for 6 non-consecutive weeks, and it also debuted at number one in Canada, and reached the top ten in many other countries. The record has been certified 14\u00d7 Platinum in the United States. It is the highest selling album by a teenager both in the US and worldwide. The album also spent fifty-one weeks in the top ten of the U.S. Billboard 200 and sixty weeks in the top twenty. With this, it became the second best-selling album of 1999, selling 8,358,619 in the United States, only behind Backstreet Boys' 'Millennium'. It stayed on the Billboard 200 for two years until it was moved to the Pop Catalog chart.  According to the RIAA, it is the 27th best-selling album in American music history, and 4th best-selling album by a female artist. This album, its lyrics, and its music videos maintained the typical virgin image of the late 1990s teen pop revival for Spears.\n\nFollowing the success of her debut album, Spears released the album 'Oops!... I Did It Again' in May 2000. It debuted at number one in the U.S. by selling 1,319,193 units during its first week of sales, breaking the SoundScan record for the highest album sales in its debut week by any solo artist. The RIAA awarded the album with a diamond certification with 10 million copies sold in the U.S.\n\nSpears released her third studio album 'Britney' in November 2001. Although not as successful as her previous albums, she assumed some creative control by co-writing five of the album's tracks. It surpassed Michael Jackson's album 'Invincible' when it had a successful debut at number one in the U.S. by selling 745,744 units during its first week.  The album's success made her the only female artist in music history to have her first three albums debut at number one.\n\nBritney also became a Pepsi spokesperson in 2001, earning a $7-8 million endorsement deal. For the \"We Will Rock You\" Pepsi campaign, featuring Pink, Beyonce and Enrique Iglesias, Britney received $9.27 million. \n\n2002 found Britney in her first movie role, the somewhat biographical Crossroads.  \n\nSpears released her fourth studio album 'In the Zone' in November 2003, jettisoning the Max Martin-produced synthpop of her earlier releases. The album took in lesser-known producers such as RedZone and big names including Moby and R. Kelly. Spears co-wrote eight of the album's thirteen songs and co-produced several pieces of her material for the first time. 'In the Zone' reached number one in the U.S. charts during its debut week, selling over 609,000 copies. This made Spears the first female in the Nielsen SoundScan era to have her first four studio albums to debut at number one.  All three singles, Me Against The Music, Toxic and Everytime, reached #1 on the Australian ARIA charts.  'Toxic' became one of Britney's signature songs and the video is considered by most to be her best.\n\nIn July 2004, Spears became engaged to back-up dancer Kevin Federline.  She and Federline were married on September 18 that same year.  She also released a fragrance in September 2004, entitled Curious, and another, Fantasy, the following year. In early 2006, she released the limited edition fragrance In Control Curious.  She released two more fragrances in 2007 and 2009 : Believe and Hidden Fantasy.\n\nNovember 2004 saw the release of her first greatest hits collection, 'Greatest Hits: My Prerogative', which features all of Spears's singles up to 'Outrageous' with the exception of \"From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart\". It also featured three previously unreleased songs, a cover version of American R&B singer Bobby Brown's 1988 hit \"My Prerogative\", \"Do Somethin'\", produced by Bloodshy and Avant, whom she had worked with on In The Zone, and \"I've Just Begun (Havin' My Fun)\", which was a song recorded for Spears's fourth album, In The Zone, but did not make the final cut. By the end of that year, Spears had become one of the best-selling artists in the world.\n\nSpears and her now husband Kevin, starred in their own reality television show, Britney and Kevin: Chaotic in the first half of 2005. In the final episode of the show, Spears debuted the single Someday (I Will Understand) but the song and video were not released in the US. 'Britney & Kevin: Chaotic...' the bonus CD, includes Mona Lisa and Over To You Now. \n\nIn November 2005, Spears released her first remix album, B In The Mix: The Remixes. The songs ranged from  \"...Baby One More Time\" to \"Toxic\". Her newest single \"Someday (I Will Understand)\" was also remixed.  Another single, \"And Then We Kiss\", was only released in Asia, where it charted in many countries. The song peaked at number 15 on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart despite it not being officially released in the U.S.  It also peaked at #13 on Australia's Hot 30 Countdown despite not being officially released.\n\nIn 2005, she won her first Grammy award for 'Best Dance Recording' for her song \"Toxic\".  On September 14, 2005, Spears gave birth to her first child, a boy, named Sean Preston.  \n\nShe appeared as a guest on Will and Grace in 2006. During an appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman in May 2006, she announced that she was expecting once again.  On September 12, 2006 Spears gave birth to her second child, a son named Jayden James. \n \nOn November 6, 2006 Spears filed for divorce from husband Kevin Federline. The divorce was finalized on July 30, 2007.  During 2007,  Britney continually lost more and more custody of her children, until her mental breakdown, which resulted in her taking Jayden hostage in a bathroom for over three hours, in Jan 08 stripped her of any visitations whatsoever for over a month.  Visitations after the month were heavily monitored.\n\nOn October 30, 2007 Spears released her 5th studio album entitled \"Blackout\" with its first single \"Gimme More\" being performed at the MTV Video Music Awards.  \"Gimme More was Britney's most successful single on the Billboard Hot 100 by peak position since \"...Baby One More Time\". The next two singles from \"Blackout\" were 'Piece of Me' and 'Break The Ice'.   Britney did minimal promotion for the album and it's singles.   For Gimme More, she filmed a music video and performed at the 2007 VMAs.  For Piece of Me, she filmed a music video.  For Break The Ice, an animated video was made.\n\nOn September 7, 2008, Spears opened the MTV Video Music Awards for the third time. Although having not performed, a skit with Jonah Hill was pre-taped, as well as an introduction speech to the official opening of the show. Spears won Best Female Video, Best Pop Video and Video Of The Year for \"Piece of Me\".\n\nOn September 15, Jive released a statement announcing the title of her sixth studio album, Circus, as well as the first single, Womanizer. The single was released to radio stations on September 26, and the release date for the album was December 2, Spears' 27th birthday.  The album was released in Australia on the 29th of November and in various European countries on the 27th.  Britney heavily promoted the album with various performances around the world, a documentary on her life since recovering from her breakdown and an upcoming world tour.\n\nMTV signed a deal with Spears and Jive records to release a documentary titled 'For the Record', which aired on November 30, 2008, two days before the release of Circus.  The documentary was shot over three months and featured Britney discussing her personal life as well as her career. \n\nCircus debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 selling 505,000 copies in its first week. This became Spears' fifth number one album, making her the only act in Nielsen SoundScan history to have four albums debuted with 500,000 copies or more.  It is also Spears' second album, the first being ...'Baby One More Time', to have charted two top-ten singles as \"Circus\", the follow up single to the number-one hit \"Womanizer\", debuted at number three on the Hot 100, making it her highest debut on the chart as well as her seventh top ten hit.\n\nWomanizer was her first #1 track on the \"Billboard Hot 100\" since ...Baby One More Time and made a new digital download record beating Touch My Body.  It also held the record for biggest jump, going from #96 to #1.  Kelly Clarkson has since beaten that record.\n\nIn March, Spears launched her seventh tour to promote her Circus album.  The Circus Starring: Britney Spears began its run on March 3, 2009 in Spears's home state of Louisiana.  Opening night, as well as every following show in North America, sold out.  The tour spans through North America (two legs), Europe, and Australia (first time touring ever).  Britney is accompanied by her children on the tour, and they are in her custody for over 50% of the time for the duration of the tour while ex-husband Kevin trails her.  \n\nIn April 2009, Spears declared her support for same-sex marriage to the media, following the controversial incident on Miss USA where contestant Carrie Prejean, representing California, expressed her disapproval of same-sex unions. The message left by Spears on her Twitter page read \u201cLove is love! People should be able to do whatever makes them happy!\u201d  After years of absence, Forbes magazine listed Spears as the 13th most powerful celebrity and the second most top-earning young musician as she made $35 million from June 2008 to June 2009. \n\nIn July 2009, Spears confirmed through her Twitter that she has begun recording new material, stating that she was going into the studio with producer Max Martin.  Also producer and remixer Russ Castella posted a message on Twitter stating that he is working on a track titled \"Dirty Girl\" for Spears.  Castella also announced that the track he is working on would be released later in 2009.  \n\nIn September 2009, Britney won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video for Womanizer.\n\nIn October of 2009, Spears released the song \"3\" to iTunes. It stayed at #1 on their charts for thirteen days and debuted at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart. It was the first song to do so in three years and the first song by a non-American Idol singer to have a song debut at  #1 in eleven years.\n\nIn November 2009, Spears completed the Circus Starring: Britney Spears tour. Whilst there was controversy caused by her lip-synching to her shows, other reviews and ticket sales still were strong.\n\nIn March 2011, Spears released her seventh studio album Femme Fatale. Max Martin and Dr. Luke executive produced the album and the album's first single \"Hold It Against Me\". The single debuted at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100. This gave Spears her fourth number-one single on the chart, and made her only the second artist in history to have two consecutive singles debut at number-one, after Mariah Carey. The album peaked at number one in the United States (selling 276,000 copies), Canada, and Australia, and peaked inside the top ten on nearly every other chart. The album's peak in the United States ties Britney with  Mariah Carey and  Janet Jackson  for the third-most number ones among women. Femme Fatale has sold over 590,000 copies in the United States and has been certified platinum by the RIAA. The album received positive critical reviews after its release, receiving a score of 67 on Metacritic, her highest critical score since Oops!... I Did It Again, with many critics naming the album one of Spears's best. In April 2011, Spears appeared in a remix to the song \"S&M\" by Rihanna after Rihanna asked her fans via Twitter who they wanted her to collaborate with. The song reached number one in the US in mid-April 2011, giving Britney her fifth number one on the chart. In early May, Spears' second single from Femme Fatale, \"Till The World Ends\", reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and had ninety-eight million audience impressions on the Billboard chart, granting Spears the highest weekly audience of her 13-year chart career. Femme Fatale's third single \"I Wanna Go\" reached the top forty on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 2011. Among females in the last thirteen years, Spears now has the third-most top forty hits, with twenty-one. In August, the single managed to reach the top-ten on the Billboard Hot 100, which is the first time for Spears to have three songs from one album in the top-ten. On the week ending September 24, 2011, \"I Wanna Go\" moved 2-1 on the mainstream top 40, becoming her sixth number-one on that chart (making her tied for third all-time) and her first number-one and third top-ten pop song for Femme Fatale. Spears now has the longest span of number ones on the mainstream top 40, with a length of twelve years, seven months, and four days.\n\nOn March 2011, Spears announced that she would tour throughout the United States during summer 2011. The Femme Fatale Tour opened June 16 at the Power Balance Pavilion in Sacramento, California to positive reviews. Many critics noted that Spears sang more of the concert live in response to lip-synching accusations during The Circus Starring Britney Spears, and that the dancing is some of her best in years. The first ten US dates of the tour grossed $6.2 million, landing the fifty-fifth spot on Pollstar's Top 100 North American Tours list for the half-way point of the year. The tour travelled to Europe and South and Central America later in 2011. On August 12, Spears announced that her performances at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto will be taped to air on the EPIX television channel and for a DVD release, resulting in the doubling of traffic to EPIX social sites and 'Britney Spears' becoming a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. Her first televised concert since the Onyx Hotel Tour in 2004, the show, Britney Spears: Femme Fatale, was shot in 2D and 3D on August 13 and 14 and will premiere on Epix in November. It has since been released to DVD and Blu-Ray.

(C) 2010 Hollywood Records, Inc."}, "description": "\"Who Owns My Heart\" is the 2nd European single from Miley Cyrus' 3rd LP, Can't Be Tamed. Miley wrote the song with Antonina Armato, Tim James, Devrim Karaoglu and Paul NZA.\n\nThe music video was filmed on August 7, 2010 in Detroit, Michigan. It was directed by Robert Hales, who also helmed the clip for \"Can't Be Tamed.\" The racy clip shows Cyrus writhing semi-naked on a bed before getting dolled up in her room and grooving in the backseat of a car clad in tiny shorts. The singer came under fire from concerned parental groups - not the first time Cyrus has provoked a reaction as she attempts to break away from her clean image as a star. Tim Winter, president of the Parents Television Council, insisted to TMZ.com that the footage sends the wrong message to Cyrus' young fans. He said: \"It is unfortunate that she would participate in such a    ualized video like this one.\nIt sends messages to her fan base that are diametrically opposed to everything she has done up to this point. Miley built her fame and fortune entirely on the backs of young     s, and it saddens us that she seems so eager to distance herself from that fan base so rapidly.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Miley+Cyrus/_/Who+Owns+My+Heart\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Miley originally desired a new sound for the record, a more rock music inclined one, before settling on techno music inclined songs influenced by the Pop singers Lady Gaga and Britney Spears. She told Billboard magazine: \"I listen to zero Pop music, which is really weird for someone who makes Pop music. My 13-year-old self would have beaten up my 17-year-old self because she would be like, 'You're a sellout!' But that's not what it is. It's not dance music that's just about, 'Ooh, I'm in the club and everyone's looking at me.' It means something. I'm not just sitting here trying to sell glitz and ... because no one lives that life. A lot of Pop songs are super shallow, but this music isn't.\"\u000bAs an example, Miley cited this track, which is about someone who finds the courage to leave an abusive relationship.\n\nThroughout her music career Miley has written songs with lyrics that empower young women. She told MTV News that the tracks on Can't Be Tamed are no different. \"I think 'Tamed' does it the best, and 'Liberty Walk,'\" she said. \"It's just about freeing yourself from anything you think is holding you back. And I think that's really important, especially for     s, because so many people are told, 'No, you can't do something,' or, 'You need to be this because Mom and Dad say that, teachers say this.'\"\n\nFor this song, Miley said she tried to combine a very serious topic with a lighter sound. \"I wrote it for women that feel like they're stuck in abusive relationships, but it's a dance song,\" she said. \"So you think that must be kind of a sad ballad, but it's a party song. It's about breaking free.\"\n\nMiley comes close to rapping on this song. However, she told MTV news this MC is not a MC: \"I call it more of a spoken, rhythmic [singing style],\" she explained. \"I'm not a rap type. Maybe a little bit. It's speaking to the music, but if I say that I'm a rapper, I'm going to be like, 'I'm not a rapper.' I've got no flow in that way.

The first concert Miley ever attended was by Poison, which introduced her to Rock and Roll. Cyrus explained in a blog that she decided to cover the track after hearing a bunch of people around her singing along to it. She decided that she wanted to give a whole new generation of music lovers the chance to hear the song. \"It's a song that everyone knows and loves,\" she said. \"I feel like the way the music industry is today really shelters kids and they aren't exposed to songs as honest and real as this one.\"\n\nCyrus got together with the lead singer and songwriter of Poison, Bret Michaels, to consult him. He guided her through the song, played guitar on the hook and sung back-up harmonies while John Shanks contributed behind the production desk. Michaels noted to MTV News that Cyrus \"nailed the song. She really knew what she was doing.\" He added, \"She got in there and picked the guitar up. It was one of those nights that just worked. It was fun. It's gotta be her taking 'Every Rose' and making it all hers.\"\n\nMiley recalled: \"Bret and I had a great time in the studio together just hanging out and making music.

Cyrus collaborated with Mike Will Made It, MoZella, P-Nasty, and Rock City during the songwriting process, while production was handled by Mike Will Made It and P-Nasty. \"Someone Else\" is influenced by electronic dance music (EDM), and additionally incorporates elements of synthpop; its lyrics reference Cyrus' evolving public image during production of the parent record.\n\nContemporary music critics were divided in their opinions of \"Someone Else\", feeling that its generic production overshadowed its lyrical meaning and Cyrus' vocal performance. Despite not having been released as a single, it peaked at number 93 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. Cyrus has also performed the track during her ongoing Bangerz Tour, where she was notably suspended mid-air on a large hot dog. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Miley+Cyrus/_/Someone+Else\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

She gained fame for her role as Miley Stewart/Hannah Montana on the Disney Channel sitcom Hannah Montana, which began in 2006 and ended in 2010. Cyrus recorded music for the soundtracks Hannah Montana (2006) and Hannah Montana 2/Meet Miley Cyrus (2007), released by Walt Disney Records, which helped establish her as a teen idol. In 2007, Cyrus signed to Hollywood Records for a solo career. She went on the Best of Both Worlds Tour the same year; the tour was eventually turned into a high-grossing concert film entitled Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert (2008).\nIn April 2008, Cyrus released her first solo album, Breakout (2008), which experienced international success and she was included in Time magazine's 2008 Top 100. She began her foray into films by providing the voice of \"Penny\" in the animated film Bolt (2008) and by reprising the role of Miley in Hannah Montana: The Movie (2009). Bolt's theme song, \"I Thought I Lost You\", earned her a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. Hannah Montana: The Movie' soundtrack introduced her to new audiences within country and adult contemporary markets.\nShe began to cultivate an adult image in 2009 with the release of The Time of Our Lives (2009), an extended play which presented a more mainstream pop sound, and by filming The Last Song (2010), a coming-of-age drama film. The former included Cyrus's best-selling single, \"Party in the U.S.A.\" (2009). Cyrus ranked number twenty-nine on Forbes' 2009 Celebrity 100. An upcoming studio album titled Can't Be Tamed will be released in 2010 and presents a new dance-pop sound. The music video and lyrics of the album's lead single, \"Can't Be Tamed\", portrays a more sexualized image for the entertainer. Cyrus has stated that she intends to focus on acting rather than singing in the future.\n\nIn 2013, Cyrus released her first album on RCA Records, \"Bangerz\", and in 2017 she released \"Younger Now\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Miley+Cyrus\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Chainsmokers hinted at Warren\u2019s involvement through a tweet, and Warren also posted a video on Instagram saying it\u2019s her vocals in the description. A follow up interview with Billboard confirmed Warren as the mysterious female vocalist.\n\nThe song was first previewed in late December 2016 live appearances at SnowGlobe and the LACC. The Chainsmokers officially teased and verified the song through Facebook in early January 2017. The song was released on January 13, 2017. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Chainsmokers/_/Paris\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Apart from Social Darwinism, the thing that separates these two men from the rest is their unsettling and uncanny ability to discover and create trends. They find the parts of things that people actually give a shit about, whatever they may be, and focus on creating and improving those parts. With live sets and productions that their own mothers describe as, &quot;sounds nice, but a little loud,&quot; these two always put on a show that was not ever described as sexy and life-changing, but should be. Apart from their unique personalities and boyish good looks, they have many similarities. They each graduated from prestigious North-Eastern Universities, they like hot chicks in yoga pants, enjoy a good burger, and have been rejected from many of the venues they now play at.The Chainsmokers have become the hottest young American EDM DJ duo. Their live shows are becoming the most sought after in EDM. Their wild antics, hilarious personalities, and addicting productions have fans interacting with them non stop and running to see them live every chance they get. Their signature sound has its foundations in Indie, Progressive and Pop Music. On the production front, their original tracks have all reached the Beatport top charts and their remixes always hit #1 on the HypeM charts. They&#39;ve gotten immense support by friends such as Nicky Romero, Steve Aoki, Pete Tong, Afrojack, Tiesto, W&W, and more.

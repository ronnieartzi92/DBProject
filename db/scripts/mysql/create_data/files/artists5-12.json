Mundart meets deep Black Music und manch eine vermochte da die Nase zu r\u00fcmpfen: Soul, in Dialekt und dazu noch Ostschweiz, the fuck no! Der Musikgeschmack, leider allzu oft R\u00fcckzugsort eines reaktion\u00e4ren Moments, auch bei freien Geistern. Doch dann kam die Welle aus den Staaten, retro Soul \u00e0 la DAPTONE Rec. \u0096 Sharon Jones (R.I.P), Charles Bradley (R.I.P), Menahan Street Band, die Dap Kings und so weiter und so fort. Pl\u00f6tzlich war da wieder dieses Feuer, pl\u00f6tzlich wurde wieder \u00fcber 60ies Sound gesprochen und der Soul war back in town und auf den Plattentellern! Die Soulnight im R\u00f6ssli ist mittlerweile ein St\u00fcck Stadtgeschichte. Aber um Min King wurde es lange ruhig, viel zu ruhig. Trotz der unglaublichen Stimme von Frontmann Philipp Albrecht. Jetzt aber sind sie zur\u00fcck, mit einem der stilsichersten und konsequentesten CH-Alben des letzten Jahres. Gut Ding will allem Anschein nach noch immer viel Weile haben. \u00abImmer Wieder\u00bb macht keine Kompromisse und setzt auf das wahre Erbe von Soul. True-Talk in sch\u00f6nster Storytelling-Manier, roh, melancholisch und ohne das leiseste Zugest\u00e4ndnis an den Mainstream. H\u00f6chste Zeit also f\u00fcr ihren zweiten Streich auch bei uns im Stall. MIN KING und R\u00f6ssli, die kleine Soulnight am Mittwoch eben. Wir freuen uns sehr!

The early nucleus of the group was composed of the band&#39;s founder Martin Perna and later included several other members (Gabriel Roth, Michael Wagner, Del Stribling aka Binky Griptite, Victor Axelrod, Fernando Bugaloo Velez, Anda Szilagyi) from the Soul Providers / Dap Kings band, performing their first show in May 1998 at St. Nick&#39;s Pub in Harlem NY.A few months into the group&#39;s existence, Perna and Roth, on a walk through their southside Williamsburg neighborhood, met Amayo, who at the time owned a boutique / kung fu studio / arts space where he sold his own fashion designs, held shows. They invited Amayo, who grew up in Lagos, Nigeria and was fluent in the music of Fela, to see a show in the neighborhood. A few weeks later, they called again to ask him to fill in for a percussionist for a show at the Cooler (NYC) and he joined the band shortly thereafter. Within months he began composing and performing lyrics and assuming the role of the group&#39;s lead vocalist / frontman.The nascent group spent its early months rehearsing and composing at Desco 41st street studios and later the first Daptone Studios at Amayo&#39;s Afro Spot. Eschewing all commercial venues for the first year, they performed exclusively in alternative spaces in lofts, community markets, parks, art spaces like Sara Roosevelt Park, Taller Latinoamericano, Brecht Forum, and the Angel Orensanz Center.In August 1999, Greenwich Village record store owner Ayo Osinibi introduced them to the owner of the Tribeca club NoMoore, where they earned a weekly residence that ran for 18 months until the club was abruptly closed by the city. At No Moore, the group&#39;s nucleus and repertoire expanded, as they routinely played three 75-90 minute sets every Friday.In 2001, following their debut record (reissued independently, then licensed to Ninja Tune) they began touring internationally, from Glastonbury, Montreux to Newport Jazz and other renowned rock, jazz and world music festivals.Around 2003, following their third album &quot;Who Is This America,&quot; the Dap Kings and Antibalas both became very busy, each group developed its separate full-time lineup although the groups would remain close, later reuniting with Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings and Charles Bradley for the 2014 DaptoneSuper Soul Revue across summer festivals and theaters in Europe and culminating in a three night run at New York&#39;s Apollo Theater.The group toured heavily between 2002 and 2007 with the releases of their third album, &quot;Who Is This America&quot;, and fourth, &quot;Security&quot;.From 2007-2012 many members and former members of the Antibalas participated in the Tony-Award winning Broadway musical FELA!, including the show&#39;s musical director Aaron Johnson, lead saxophonist Stuart Bogie, and assistant MD trumpeter Jordan McLean.In 2011, the group returned to the Daptone House of Soul to record their most recent album, &quot;Antibalas&quot; produced by emeritus member Gabriel Roth.

Their debut album, Make the Road by Walking was released on Dunham Records, Brenneck\u2019s new imprint of Daptone Records, a joint venture devoted to bringing the Menahan Street sound from Brenneck\u2019s bedroom out into the world. The album is marked by eerily quirky arrangements, featuring vibes, horns, piano, organ, percussion and even a strange bling sound that Brenneck creates by tuning and plucking the strings of his guitar on the wrong side of the bridge. However, it is not the textures themselves that make the new sound of Menahan Street so exciting, but rather the way the sounds are incorporated into the heavy rhythms and bold melodies of the compositions.\n\nThe title of the album was inspired both by the eponymous community center below Brenneck\u2019s apartment and the natural rhythm that has continued to move this project forward. Shortly after its release as Dunham\u2019s debut 45rpm single, the song \"Make the Road by Walking\" was sampled by fellow Brooklynite Jay-Z for his smash hit from American Gangster, \"Roc Boys (and the Winner Is)\", (later declared by Rolling Stone to be the No. 1 single of 2007).\n\nMake the Road by Walking is a soulful exploration by a talented young group of musicians into the possibilities of instrumental music; an original, personal, and uncompromised creation that embodies the sound of a select group of musicians in one distinct place, at one particular moment in time. \u201cThis album is kind of a window into our world on Menahan Street,\u201d says Brenneck. \u201cIn a way, we\u2019re simply the street\u2019s unofficial house band.\u201d\n\nThe acclaimed Brooklyn-based multi-instrumentalists in Menahan Street Band are set to release their sophomore album titled The Crossing on October 30 2012, via Daptone Records imprint Dunham Records. The album\u2019s title track premiered on RollingStone.com and MSB are set to perform their new songs on the road this fall, as they head out with Charles Bradley for a west coast run. See current tour dates below.\n\nIn addition to their role as the official house band for Brooklyn-based Dunham Records, Menahan Street Band has received critical praise for their oft-sampled 2008 debut album Make The Road By Walking (sampled by Jay-Z, 50 Cent, Kid Cudi, Curren$y, and more) and for backing breakout soul singer Charles Bradley on his 2011 debut album No Time For Dreaming (co-written and produced by MSB co-founder and multi-instrumentalist Thomas Brenneck).\n\n\u201cVibe is a quintessential element in what I\u2019m going for,\u201d says Brenneck of creating the album. \u201cVibe, mood and emotion.\u201d Those three elements are all over The Crossing, from the opening drum roll of the ominous title track, through the final burst of wah-wah guitar on the closing \u201cIvory and Blue.\u201d The Crossing takes you on a cinematic instrumental journey through a nocturnal landscape of moods and emotions, propelled by funky, hip-hop-influenced grooves and dream-like horn and keyboard melodies.\n\nDespite Menahan Street Band\u2019s deep connections to the Brooklyn soul scene, The Crossing isn\u2019t soul music per se\u2026 it\u2019s more like \u201cdark night of the soul\u201d music. \u201cI recorded a lot of it from midnight until the sun came up, all the weird synthesizers and slide guitar,\u201d Brenneck notes. \u201cA lot of it was really moody, just me going slightly out of my head in the middle of the night. And that was the mood I wanted to evoke when people listen to it, to put them in deep thought \u2014 your mind should wander into some weird places when you\u2019re listening to this.\u201d\n\nRecorded over a period of nearly two years, The Crossing is an 11-track sonic testament to the fruitful creative relationship that exists between band: Brenneck, drummer and band co-founder Homer Steinweiss, bassist Nick Movshon, trumpeter Dave Guy and tenor saxophonist Leon Michels. The five members have been playing together in one project or another since the early 2000s, when they were all members of The Dap-Kings. Antibalas keyboardist Victor Axelrod, a former Dap-King himself, played organ on two of the album\u2019s tracks, while The Budos Band\u2019s Mike Deller contributed piano.\n\n\u201cOriginally MSB was just about us wanting to make some music for ourselves that was outside of the tight-knit formula of the music we were playing in the Dap-Kings and Antibalas, and wanting to embrace the fact that we grew up on hip-hop and classic rock,\u201d adds Brenneck. \u201cThere\u2019s a discipline that goes into playing Fela\u2019s music, and that goes into playing James Brown music; we love that to death, and we studied it hard in order to be able to play it with any sort of authenticity. But I love Neil Young, The Beatles, and Jimi Hendrix, and we all love Wu-Tang Clan and the early RZA productions as much as we all love Stax and Motown. With MSB, we can really let all these influences show.\u201d\n\nThe Crossing\u2019s more mature and expansive sound is also the result of the place where it was recorded. Dunham Sound Studios is the all-analog recording studio Brenneck built four years ago in Brooklyn with Steinweiss which was funded by a royalty check they received after Jay-Z sampled the title track of Make The Road By Walking for his 2007 hit, \u201cRoc Boys (And the Winner Is\u2026)\u201d. Other artists that have performed/recorded at Dunham Sound and with Menahan Street Band include Mark Ronson, Rufus Wainwright, Cee-lo Green, Theophilus London and Diane Birch, among many others. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Menahan+Street+Band\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Though Entombed began their career as an early pioneer of Scandinavian death metal, by the early 1990s their sound had broadened to include hard rock and other influences. This new style would eventually be described as Death 'n' Roll, of which Entombed remains arguably the best-known example.\n\nEntombed's debut album was Left Hand Path, a cult favorite that established the band as a popular death metal band. The follow-up, Clandestine, was just as popular. These first two albums were unique in that they featured what was sometimes referred to as an \"chain saw\" guitar sound. It was created using the Boss Heavy Metal distortion pedal and a Peavey amplifier.\n\nAfter the Gods of Grind tour, Entombed began changing their sound into a mix of hard rock and death metal frequently called Death and Roll. Although this may have turned off many fans, it established their mainstream and critical reputation. Wolverine Blues and Hollowman are widely considered classics of early 1990s death metal, but were followed by problems with various record companies.\n\nIn 1999, Entombed released Uprising, which was an anti-commercial return to the band's roots.

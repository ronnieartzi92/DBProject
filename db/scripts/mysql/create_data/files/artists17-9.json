Speaking with Songfacts about this song in a 2011 interview, McCain said that though the track was not intended as a love song he is happy its become such a popular wedding song. He said: \"The fact that people use 'I'll Be' for their weddings, and weddings don't have an expiration. Every year there are weddings. I'm not associated with the '90s, I'm associated with weddings. So it never ends. It's timeless.\"\n\nThe song was released as the first and only single from his second album Misguided Roses. McCain recorded an acoustic version of the song for his follow-up album, Messenger.\n\nIt was covered by Dean Geyer on his debut CD Rush.\n\n\"I'll Be\" ended up being a success for McCain in the United States, peaking at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100. While it was only his second single to chart, it became his first and only Top 10 hit and his biggest hit to date.\n\n\"I'll Be\" was featured on A Cinderella Story: Original Soundtrack, music from the 2004 movie starring Hilary Duff and Chad Michael Murray and Family Man starring Nicolas Cage. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Edwin+McCain/_/I%27ll+Be\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His hit songs, authentic spirit and surprisingly affable sense of humor keep fans coming back time and time again for nights that feel more like parties with old friends than rock concerts. After recording two of the biggest love songs in the history of pop music, McCain now performs upwards of 100 shows annually throughout the US as a solo artist, with his full band or his acoustic trio. Recently, hes added orchestras to his repertoire, performing with symphonies in select markets where he brings his powerful songs to majestic new heights. Those enduring love songs (and wedding must-haves) Ill Be and I Could Not Ask For Morearent just for the romantic at heart; American Idol and The Voice contestants turn to Edwins ballads every single year to help them win over judges and fans alike (just ask last seasons AI winner, Nick Fradiani). Even Justin Bieber has been known to belt out Ill Beduring his own concerts. Earlier this year, McCain suddenly found himself with a whole new crop of fans when his Flipping Ships television show debuted on Animal Planet. Flipping Ships took him from the chart tops to the boat shop - his very own Boats Have Souls (www.BoatsHaveSouls.com), a restoration outfit dedicated to bringing life back to vessels and customizing them to perfectly fit their new owners. We started the business to put good boats into good families hands by restoring them in ways that might otherwise be financially out of reach, Edwin explains. Viewers were fascinated by the blood, sweat and the occasional tear that he poured into his renovations while rehabbed boats found new life and new owners, including a few non-profit organizations in his homestate of South Carolina. Just like his songs, Edwins boats all have a story to tell; about the people who built them, Edwins team who defies all odds to reconstruct them, and the families who take them home. But his heart remains on the road. Once the Flipping Ships season ended, Edwin picked up his guitar once again and returned to the stage. Whenever he can, he likes to drop by favorite club haunts, a comfortable return to his early days that delights both his fans and himself. The 15-year-old me would have crawled through a river of fire to be the 41-year-old singer/songwriter that I am today, and I remember that.

Even Justin Bieber has been known to belt out Ill Be during his own concerts.Earlier this year, McCain suddenly found himself with a whole new crop of fans when his Flipping Ships television show debuted on Animal Planet. Flipping Ships took him from the chart tops to the boat shop his very own Boats Have Souls (www.BoatsHaveSouls.com), a restoration outfit dedicated to bringing life back to vessels and customizing them to perfectly fit their new owners. We started the business to put good boats into good families hands by restoring them in ways that might otherwise be financially out of reach, Edwin explains. Viewers were fascinated by the blood, sweat and the occasional tear that he poured into his renovations while rehabbed boats found new life and new owners, including a few non-profit organizations in his homestate of South Carolina. Just like his songs, Edwins boats all have a story to tell; about the people who built them, Edwins team who defies all odds to reconstruct them, and the families who take them home.But his heart remains on the road. Once the Flipping Ships season ended, Edwin picked up his guitar once again and returned to the stage. Whenever he can, he likes to drop by favorite club haunts, a comfortable return to his early days that delights both his fans and himself.

While his albums are released under his name, he does have a permanent band, referred to as the Edwin McCain Band. Members of the band as of 2007 include Larry Chaney, lead guitar; Pete Riley, rhythm guitar and background vocals; Craig Shields, saxophone and keyboards; Manny Yames, bass guitar; and Peter Alexander, drums.\n\nAfter signing a contract with the Atlantic Records label Lava Records in 1994, his first major-label album, Honor Among Thieves, was issued in 1995. His second album, Misguided Roses, spawned I'll Be, a major single in 1998. Two more albums (Messenger and Far from Over) followed, but at the end of 2001, he split from Lava. In 2003 he released a collection of acoustic versions of songs both old and new called The Austin Sessions via ATC Records, a Nashville-based independent record label (at which McCain was the first artist signed following its creation in 2001). Mid-2004 saw the arrival of his first studio album in three years, entitled Scream & Whisper, which was released on another indie label, DRT Entertainment.\n\nHe has released two DVDs to date. The first was through ATC records in late 2002, called Mile Marker: Songs and Stories from the Acoustic Highway, and it consisted of interviews, live performances, and other material. The other was in late 2004, Tinsel & Tap Shoes. It was his first live concert DVD, recorded at The House of Blues in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.\n\nA new CD was released in April, 2006 titled, Lost in America. Edwin recently signed a contract with Vanguard Records. This album (#8) is said to be a true \"rock 'n roll\" collection.\n\nProfile photo by ASHLittle. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Edwin+McCain\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Ages under 16 require parental permission with the event waiver signed by one of the parents. \u00a0 What are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event? On the North side of Sunnyside Ave across the street from the Zoo is a section of parking that belongs to This Is The Place Heritage Park, which they lease to the Zoo as over flow parking.\u00a0 The Zoo has given us permission to park in that section.\u00a0 At the end of the ride you can rack your bike before enjoying the ZOO, or walk your bike with you into the ZOO to the refreshment area reserved for TITRPUBA, and they will be watched while you sojourne through the ZOO. Then after, you can walk them back to your cars with you. \u00a0 What can I bring into the event? Besides the bicycle equipment you will use, you should limit your additional gear to one large sachel or two smaller bags, and your camping gear of a tent you&#39;re familiar with, a sleeping bag and air mattress.\u00a0 Something warm in case of cold weather at night, and a water repellant parka in case of a rain would be good to bring. One large bag or two smaller bags plus your camping gear.\u00a0 All of these items will be shuttled ahead of you each day to the next campground where you will be able to set them up when you arrive at the end of the ride that day.\u00a0 If you rented your camping gear from the Boy Scouts, The Scouts will set up your tent with the mattress and sleeping bag layed out inside of it.\u00a0 You can either rent your camping gear from the Boy Scouts at $250 for a tent, mattress and sleeping bag for the entire event, or bring your own camping gear, which we will shuttle ahead of you to each camping venue.\u00a0 Along with your camping gear, one big sachel or two smaller bags will be appropriate for the six days. \u00a0 How can I contact the organizer with any questions? There will be a new email addresses at info@titrpuba.com.\u00a0 If the answer you get is not sufficient or if you absolutely need to contact the organizer for an answer, email to capi@titrpuba.com, but be patient for a reply. \u00a0 What&#39;s the refund policy? Because this inaugral year is being heavily discounted, there will be no refunds because others who may have purchased your ticket may have already moved on to register for another event.\u00a0 However, you are free to sell your ticket to another interested person, but please notify the event of that transaction by email to Capi so that we have accurate data on those who are particpating in the TITRPUBA.\u00a0 Beyond that, Capi will consider emergency situations, but he will be very busy with preparations so if you do not hear back within a week, please send a second email. \u00a0 ", "img": null, "title": "TITRPUBA.com (\"This Is The Right Place\" Utah Bicycle Adventure)", "url": "http://saltlakecity.eventful.com/events/titrpubacom-thisistherightplace-utah-bicycl-/E0-001-106910735-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "This Is The Place Heritage Park", "city": "Salt Lake City"}, {"date": "2018-01-21 09:00:00", "description": " Many of us who have set up their own business or are dreaming of becoming our own boss, do so in part to improve our quality of life.

His music explores every avenue of Techno, from hard hitting main room jams, to experimental workouts, drawing from myriad of influences past and present. Pushing his sound and beyond with his DJing, he was invited to make his live show debut at Berghain in 2015.<br><br> 2018 will be approaching Chris\u2019s 20th year in Techno so who better than to take us on a journey through the history of the genre?

Few had a greater impact than Chiune Sugihara, who as the Japanese imperial Consul-General to Lithuania, saved Jews by issuing temporary transit visas for them to escape Europe. Chiune Sugihara and his wife, Yukiko, when confronted with evil, obeyed the kindness of their hearts and the conscience of their souls, and took action that saved the lives of over 6000 Jews. These survivors became known as \u201cSugihara Survivors\u201d. Chiune Sugihara performed these acts of compassion in defiance of orders from the Japanese Foreign Ministry in Tokyo that denied him permission to issue these life-saving visas. Chiune Sugihara selflessly sacrificed his diplomatic career and risked his life, and the lives of his family, in order to save others. In 1985, more than 50 years later, he and his wife, Yukiko, were recognized as Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem in Israel for his actions. He is the only Japanese national to be so honored. \u00a0 Am Yisrael Chai is honored to present: Leo Melamed, one of the Sugihara Survivors and Chihiro Sugihara, grandson of Chiune Sugihara. \u00a0 Leo Melamed was born in Bialystok, Poland on March 20, 1932. On September 1st, 1939, Germany declared war on Poland. Leo and his family narrowly escaped death as they managed to flee on the last train out of Bialystok and headed for Vilnius, Lithuania. The situation in Lithuania deteriorated rapidly. Leo Melamed and his family were fortunate to receive one of Chiune Sugihara\u2019s visas. Leo and his parents traveled the treacherous Trans-Siberian Railroad to Japan, and then in 1941 immigrated to the US where they settled in Chicago. Leo attended Law School, and is now a lawyer, writer, lecturer, and financial market innovator. Leo is recognized as the founder of the financial futures market, and is Chairman Emeritus of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group. Chihiro Sugihara, grandson of Chiune Sugihara and Chairperson of the Visas for Life non-profit organization, has dedicated his life to the legacy of his grandfather, and will share his insights about his grandfather.

fried.\"\n\nWell, Dan got happy and he started raving.\nHe pulled out a razor, but he wasn't shaving.\nAnd all the cats knew to jump and hop,\n'Cause he was born and raised in a butcher shop.\n\nHe hollered, \"Rave on, children, I'm with ya!\nRave on, cats,\" he cried.\n\"It's almost dawn, the cops are gone.\nLet's all get Dixie fried.\"\n\nThe cops heard Dan when he started to shout.\nThey all ran in to see what it was about.\nAnd I heard him holler as they led him away.\nHe turned his head, and this is what he had to say.\n\nHe hollered, \"Rave on children, I'm with ya!\nRave on, cats,\" he cried.\n\"It's almost dawn, the cops are gone.\nLet's all get Dixie fried.\"\n\nNow, Dan was the bravest man that we ever saw.\nHe let us all know he wasn't scared of the law.\nAnd through The black crossed bar he tossed a note.\nAnd it said \"It ain't my fault, hon, that I'm in here.\"\n\nBut He hollered, \"Rave on, children, I'm with you!\nRave on, cats,\" he cried.\n\n\"It's almost dawn, the cops ain't gone,\nAnd I've been Dixie fried.\"", "youtube": {"duration": 122, "date_published": "2014-03-10 20:21:01", "video_id": "vtVF6fmN2KE", "description": "R&R-)-(---"}, "description":

His best known song was \"Blue Suede Shoes\" in 1956 which was the first single to top three charts listed by Billboard Magazine - popular, country and western, and rhythm and blues. Perkins had a long association with musical collaborator Johnny Cash, and was a an influence on numerous artists including The Beatles, and the Rolling Stones. \nA highly regarded and influential American pioneer of rockabilly music, a mix of rhythm and blues and country music, recorded most notably at Sun Records in Memphis, beginning in 1954. An outstanding performer, his touch on rock and roll music is still heard to this day.\nAccording to country musician  Charlie Daniels, \"Carl Perkins' songs personified the Rockabilly Era, and Carl Perkins' sound personifies the Rockabilly Sound more so than anybody involved in it, because he never changed.\"  Perkins's songs have been recorded by artists as influential as Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Johnny Cash, which further cemented his place in the history of popular music.\n\nCarl Lee Perkins was the son of poor sharecroppers near Tiptonville, Tennessee. He grew up hearing Southern gospel music sung by whites in church and by black field workers when he started working in the cotton fields at age six. In the spring and fall, the school day would be followed by several hours of work in the fields. During the summer workdays were 12 - 14 hours, \"from can to can't\". Carl and his brother Jay together would earn 50 cents per day. With all family members working, and credit, there was enough money for beans and potatoes, some tobacco for Carl's father Buck, and every so often the luxury of a five cent bag of hard candy.\n\nOn Saturday nights he would listen to the radio along with his father and hear music from the Grand Ole Opry. Roy Acuff's broadcast performances on the Opry inspired Perkins to ask his parents for a guitar.  Because they couldn't afford a real guitar, Carl's father fashioned one from a cigar box and a broomstick. When a neighbor in tough straits offered to sell his dented and scratched Gene Autry signature model guitar with worn out strings, Buck purchased it for a couple of dollars. For the next year Carl taught himself parts of Roy Acuff's \"Great Speckled Bird\" and \"The Wabash Cannonball\", which he had heard on the Opry. Perkins also cites the sped up, driving. straight time playing and detached but determined, wispy but challenging vocals of Bill Monroe as an early influence.\n\nCarl began learning more about playing his guitar from a fellow field worker named John Westbrook who befriended him. \"Uncle John\", as Carl called him, was an African American in his sixties who played blues and gospel on his battered acoustic guitar. Most famously, \"Uncle John\" advised Carl when playing the guitar to \"Get down close to it. You can feel it travel down the strangs, come through your head and down to your soul where you live. You can feel it. Let it vib-a-rate.\" Because Carl couldn't afford new strings when they broke, he retied them. The knots would cut into his fingers when he tried to slide to another note, so he began bending the notes, stumbling onto a type of blue note.\"\n\nCarl was recruited to be a member of the Lake County Fourth Grade Marching Band, and because of the Perkins' limited finances, was given a new white shirt, cotton pants, white band cap and red cape by Miss Lee McCutcheon, who was in charge of the band.\n\nIn January of 1947, Buck Perkins moved his family from Lake County to Madison County. A replacement radio which ran on electricity rather than battery, and the nearness of Memphis made it possible for Carl to hear a wider variety of music.\n\nAt age fourteen, using the I IV V chord progression common to country songs of the day, he wrote a song that would be known as \"Let Me Take You To the Movie, Magg\" around Jackson. (The same song would convince Sam Phillips to sign Perkins to his Sun Records label.)\n\n\nBeginnings as a Performer:\nPerkins and his brother Jay had their first paying job (in tips) as entertainment at the \"CottonBoll\" on Highway 45 some twelve miles south of Jackson, TN starting on Wednesday nights in late 1946. Carl was only fourteen years old. One of the songs they played was an uptempo, country blues shuffle version of Bill Monroe's \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\". Free drinks were one of the perks of playing in a honky tonk, and Carl drank four beers that first night. Within a month Carl and Jay began playing Friday and Saturday nights at the Sand Ditch near the western boundary of Jackson. Both places were the scene of frequent fights, and both of the Perkins Brothers gained a reputation as fighters. \n\nIn the next couple of years the Perkins Brothers began playing other tonks, including El Rancho, The Roadside Inn, and the Hilltop, around Bemis and Jackson as they became a big draw. Carl talked his brother Clayton into playing the bass fiddle to fill in the sound of the band.[13] Carl began appearing regularly on Jackson radio station WTJS in the late forties as a sometime member of the Tennessee Ramblers. He also appeared on another show, Hayloft Frolic, where he performed two single songs; sometime including \"talking Blues\" as done by Robert Lunn on the Grand Ole Opry. Carl, and then his brothers began appearing on The Early Morning Farm and Home Hour. Overwhelmingly positive listener response led to a fifteen minute segment sponsored by Mother's Best Flour. By the end of the 40s, the Perkins Brothers were in a league of their own as the best known band in the Jackson area.\n\nCarl had day jobs during most of these early years, working first at picking cotton, then at Day's Dairy in Malesus, then a mattress factory, and in then a battery plant. He then began as a pan greaser at the Colonial Baking Company and worked there from 1951 through 1952.\n\nIn January of 1953 Carl married a woman he had known for a number of years, Valda Crider. When his job at the bakery was reduced to part time, Valda, who had her own job at the time, encouraged Carl to begin working the tonks full time. Carl began playing six night a week. Late in the same year he added W.S. \"Fluke\" Holland, who had no previous experience as a musician, but a good sense of rhythm, to the band as a drummer.\n\nIn July of 1954, Perkins and his wife, Valda, heard a new release of \"[Blue Moon of Kentucky\" by Elvis Presley, Scotty, and Bill on the radio.[18] Valda exclaimed, \"Listen! They play like y'all! It sounds like you!\" After recording the take of the song that was released, Presley exclaimed, \"That sounds like Carl Perkins!\". As \"Blue Moon of Kentucky faded out, Carl said, \"There's a man in Memphis who understands what we're doing. I need to go see him.\"\n\n\nSun Records era:\n\nPerkins successfully auditioned for Sam Phillips at Sun Records early in October of 1954. \"Movie Magg\" and \"Turn Around\" were released on the Phillips owned Flip label (151) March 19, 1955 hit. with \"Turn Around\" becoming a regional.  With \"Turn Around\" getting airplay across the South and Southwest, Perkins was booked to appear along with Elvis Presley at theaters in Mariana and West Memphis, Arkansas. Commenting on the audience reaction to both Presley and himself Perkins said, \"When I'd jump around they'd scream some, but they were gettin' ready for him. It was like TNT, man, it just exploded. All of a sudden the world was wrapped up in rock.\"\n\nJohnny Cash and the Tennessee Two were the next musicians to be added to the performances by Sun musicians. Over the summer of '55 there were trips to Little Rock, Forrest City, Corinth, and Tupelo. Again performing at El Rancho, the Perkins brothers were involved in an automobile accident. A friend, who had been driving, was pinned by the steering wheel. Perkins managed to drag him from the car, which had caught on fire. Clayton had been thrown from the car, but was not seriously injured.\"\n\nAnother Perkins' tune \"Gone Gone Gone\", released in October 1955 by Sun, was also a regional hit. It was backed by the more traditional \"Let The Juke Box Keep On Playing\", complete with fiddle, \"Western Boogie\" bass line, steel guitar, and weepy vocal.\n\nThat same fall of 1955, Perkins wrote the song \"Blue Suede Shoes\" after seeing a dancer at a honky-tonk get mad at his date for scruffing up his blue suede shoes. Several weeks later, on December 19, 1955, Perkins and his band recorded the song during a session at the Sun studios in Memphis. Phillips suggested changes to the lyrics (\"Go Cat Go\") and the band changed the end of the song to a boogie vamp. During the long session, as liquor flowed, the sound became tougher, harder and looser, and Perkins played with passion. Phillips knew he had found the right song to bring out the blues strain in Perkins' music and produce a pop hit. Elvis Presley left Sun for a larger opportunity with RCA in November, and on December 19, 1955, Phillips, who had begun recording Perkins in late 1954, told Perkins, \"Carl Perkins, you're my rockabilly cat now\". \n\nReleased on January 1, 1956, \"Blue Suede Shoes\" was a massive chart success. In the United States, it went to #1 on Billboard magazine's country music charts (the only #1 hit he would have) and to #2 on Billboard's Best Sellers pop music chart. Finally, on March 17, Perkins became the first country artist to reach the #3 spot on the rhythm & blues charts. In the United Kingdom, it became a Top Ten hit. It was the first record by a Sun label artist to sell a million copies. \n\n\nThe Accident:\n\nAfter playing a show in Norfolk, VA on March 21, 1956, the Perkins Brothers Band headed for New York City and their appearance on the nationally broadcast Perry Como Show. Shortly before sunrise near Dover, Delaware Stuart Pinkham (aka Dick Stuart, and Poor Richard) assumed the duties as driver. After running head on into the back of a pickup truck, their car ended up in a ditch of water about a foot deep, and Carl was lying face down in the water. Drummer W.C. Holland rolled Carl over, saving him from drowning. Carl had suffered 3 fractured vertebrae in his neck, a severe concussion, a broken collar bone, and lacerations all over his body in the crash. Carl remained unconscious for an entire day. The driver of the pickup, Thomas Phillips, a forty year old farmer, died when he was thrown into the steering wheel of his pickup. Carl's brother Jay had a fractured neck along with severe internal injuries.\n\nOn March 23 Bill Black, Scotty Moore and D.J. Fontana visited Carl on their way to New York to appear with Elvis the next day. Bill Black told Carl, \"Hey, man, Elvis sends his love\", and lit a cigarette for him, in spite of the fact that the patient in the next bed was in an oxygen tent. A week later, Carl was given a telegram, which had actually arrvied on the 23rd, from Elvis wishing him a speedy recovery.\n\nSam Philips had planned to surprise Perkins with a gold record during the Perry Como show. \"Shoes\" had already sold more than 500,000 copies by March 22. Now, while Carl recuperated from the accident, \"Blue Suede Shoes\" rose to number one on most pop, R&B, and country regional charts. It also held the number two positon on the Billboard Hot 100 and country charts. Elvis Presley's \"Heartbreak Hotel\" held the number one position on the pop and country charts, while \"Shoes\" did better than \"Heartbreak\" on the R&B charts. By Mid-April, more than one million copies of \"Shoes\" had been sold.\n\nOn April 3, while still out of commission, but back in Jackson, Perkins would see his friend Elvis Presley perform \"Blue Suede Shoes\" on his first Milton Berle Show appearance. Presley performed the song on national television 3 times that year, and made references to it twice during an appearance on The Steve Allen Show. Although his version became more famous than Perkins', it only reached #20 on Billboard's pop chart.\n\n\nReturn to Recording and Touring:\n\nPerkins returned to live performances on April 21 of the same year beginning with an appearance in Beaumont, Texas with the \"Big D Jamboree\" tour.\n\nBefore resuming life on the road, Sam Phillips arranged a recording session at Sun with Ed Cisco filling in for the still recuperating Jay. By mid-April \"Dixie Fried\", \"Put Your Cat Clothes On\", \"Right String, Wrong Yo-Yo\", \"You Can't Make Love to Somebody\", \"Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby\", and \"That Don't Move Me\" had been recorded.\n\nPerkins was paid $1,000 to play just two songs a night on the extended tour of \"Top Stars of '56\" beginning in early summer. A couple of the other performers on this tour were Chuck Berry, and Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers. When Perkins and the group took the stage in Columbia, SC, Carl was appalled to see a teenager with a bleeding chin pressed against the stage by the crowd. During the first guitar break of \"Honey Don't\" they were waved off stage and into a vacant dressing room behind a double line of police officers. Carl is quoted as saying, \"It was dangerous. Lot of kids got hurt. There was a lot of rioting going on, just crazy, man! The music drove 'em insane.\" Appalled by what he had seen and experienced, Carl left the tour. \n\nSun issued more Perkins' songs in 1956: Boppin'The Blues/All Mama's Children (Sun 243), Dixie Fried/I'm Sorry, I'm Not Sorry (Sun 249). Matchbox/All Mama's Children (Sun 261) came out in February of 1957.  Matchbox is considered to be a rockabilly classic, and George Thorogood and the Destroyers covered \"Dixie Fried\" on their 1985 album Maverick.\n\nThe day Matchbox was recorded, Elvis Presley visited the studio. Along with Johnny Cash (who left early), Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Presley spent more than an hour singing gospel, country and rhythm-and-blues songs while a tape rolled. The casual session was called The Million Dollar Quartet by a local newspaper the next day, and was eventually released on a disk in 1990.\n\nThe 1957 film Jamboree includes a Perkins performance of Glad All Over that runs 1:55. Glad All Over, written by Schroeder, Tepper, and Bennett, was released by Sun in January of 1958. Perkins also made at least two appearances on the Town Hall Party in Compton, CA in 1957. singing both Blues Suede Shoes and Matchbox. Those performances were included in the \"Western Ranch Dance Party\" series filmed and distributed by Screen Gems.\n\n\nLife after Sun:\n\nIn 1958, Perkins moved to Columbia Records where he recorded songs such as: Jive at Five, Anyway the Wind Blows, Hambone, Pointed Toe Shoes and Sister Twister.\n\nThe Golden Nugget Casino in Las Vegas was the site of many performances in 1962 along with appearances in 9 mid Western states and a tour of Germany. Appearances at The Golden Nugget continued through 1963.\n\nIn May of 1964 Perkins toured England along with Chuck Berry, and Eric Burdon and The Animals backed the two stars from the States On the last night of the tour, he attended a party that turned out to be for him, and ended up sitting on the floor sharing stories, playing guitar, and singing songs while surrounded by The Beatles: John, Paul, George, and Ringo; who were at the time the hottest group in the world. Ringo asked Carl if he could record \"Honey Don't.\" \"Man,\" answered Carl, \"go ahead, have at it.\" The Beatles, would cover \"Matchbox\", \"Honey Don't\", and also \"Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby\" recorded by Perkins but written by, and originally recorded by, Rex Griffin. Glad All Over, also performed by Perkins, but not written by him, and not to be confused with The Dave Clark Five song of the same name, was also covered. Another tour to Germany followed in the fall.\n\nAlthough he had been trying to rehabilitate himself by only drinking beer (but lots of it), in 1968, while on tour with the Johnny Cash troupe, Perkins began a four day drunk in Tulsa, OK starting with a bottle of Early Times. Nevertheless, with the urging of Cash, he opened a show in San Diego by playing four songs after seeing \"four or five of me in the mirror\", and while being able to see \"nothin' but a blur\". After drinking yet another pint of Early Times, he passed out on the tour bus. By morning he started hallucinating \"big spiders, and dinosaurs, huge, and they were gonna step on me.\" The bus was now parked on a beach at the ocean. He was tempted by yet another pint of whiskey that he had hidden on the bus. He took the bottle with him onto the beach and fell on his knees and said, \"Lord... I'm gonna throw this bottle. I'm gonna show You that I believe in You.\" I sailed it into the Pacific... I got up, I knew I had done the right thing.\" Perkins and Cash, who had his own problems with drugs, then gave each other support to stay away from their drug of choice.\n\nIn 1968, Johnny Cash took the Perkins-written \"Daddy Sang Bass\" (based upon the American standard \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\") to #1 on the country music charts. \"Daddy Sang Bass\" was also a Country Music Association nominee for Song of the Year. Perkins spent a decade in Cash's singer touring revue and appeared on The Johnny Cash Show. Perkins played \"MatchBox\" along with Cash and with Eric Clapton and band mates (Derek and the Dominoes). Cash also featured Perkins in rehearsal jamming with Jos\u00e9 Feliciano and Merle Travis.\n\nA Kraft Music Hall episode hosted by Johnny Cash had Perkins singing his song \"Restless\"[17] on April 16, 1969.[18] Country music fans may recognize The Statler Brothers' song \"Flowers on the Wall\", which was also featured on this show. In February of 1969 Perkins joined with Bob Dylan to write the song \"Champaign, Illinois\". Dylan was recording in Nashville from February 12 through February 21 for an album that would be titled Nashville Skyline, and met Perkins when he appeared on The Johnny Cash Show on June 7.[19] Dylan had written one verse of a song, but was stuck. After Perkins worked out a loping rhythm and improvised a verse ending lyric, Dylan said, \"Your song. Take it. Finish it.\"[41] The co authored song was included in Perkins' 1969 album \"On Top\". \n\nPerkins was also united in 1969 by Columbia's Murray Krugman with a long-hair rockabilly group based in New York's Hudson Valley, the New Rhythm and Blues Quartet. Carl and NRBQ recorded \"Boppin' the Blues\" which featured the New York band backing Perkins on some songs like his staples \"Turn Around\" and \"Boppin' the Blues\" and included songs recorded separately by Carl and NRBQ. \n\nOne of his TV appearances with Cash was on the popular country series Hee Haw in an episode aired February 16, 1974.\n\nIn 1981 Perkins recorded the song 'Get It' with Paul McCartney, providing vocals and playing guitar with the former Beatle. This recording was included on the chart topping album Tug Of War released in 1982.[20] This track also appeared as the B-side of the title track single in a slightly edited form. One source states that Perkins \"wrote the song with Paul McCartney\".\n\nThe rockabilly revival of the 1980s helped bring Perkins back into the limelight. In 1985, he re-recorded \"Blue Suede Shoes\" with two members of the Stray Cats, as part of the soundtrack for the movie, Porky's Revenge. That same year, George Harrison, Eric Clapton, and Ringo Starr appeared with him on a television special taped in London, England, called Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session. Perkins and his friends ended the session by singing his signature song, 30 years after its writing, which brought Perkins to tears.\n\nIn 1985, Perkins was inducted to the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and in 1987, wider recognition of his contribution to music came with his induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In addition, \"Blue Suede Shoes\" was chosen as one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll, and as a Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipient. His pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.\n\nPerkins' only notable film performance as an actor was in John Landis' 1985 film Into the Night, a cameo-laden film that includes a scene where characters played by Carl and David Bowie die at each other's hand.\n\nIn 1986, he returned to the Sun Studios in Memphis, joining Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and Roy Orbison on the album Class of '55. The record was a tribute to their early years at Sun and, specifically, the Million Dollar Quartet jam session involving Perkins, Presley, Cash, and Lewis on December 4, 1956.\n\nIn 1989, he co-wrote and played guitar on The Judd's #1 country hit, \"Let Me Tell You About Love\".\n\n\nLater years:\n\nIn 1989 Perkins signed a record deal for an album with the title Friends, Family, and Legends, featuring performances by Chet Atkins, Travis Tritt, Steve Wariner, Joan Jett, Charlie Daniels, along with Paul Shaffer and Will Lee. In 1992 Perkins developed throat cancer during the production of this CD. Perkins returned to Sun Studio in Memphis to record with Scotty Moore, Presley's first guitar player. The CD was called 706 ReUNION, released on Belle Meade Records, and featured D.J. Fontana, Marcus Van Storey and The Jordanaires. In 1993, Perkins appeared with the Kentucky Headhunters in a music video remake, shot in Glasgow, Kentucky, of his song Dixie Fried. Perkins' last album, Go Cat Go!, was released in 1996, and featured new collaborations with many of the above artists, as well as George Harrison, Paul Simon, John Fogerty, Tom Petty, and Bono. It was released by the independent label Dinosaur Records, and distributed by BMG.\n\nHis last major concert appearance was the \"Music for Montserrat\" all-star charity concert at Royal Albert Hall on September 15, 1997.\n\n\nDeath and legacy:\n\nFour months later at Jackson-Madison County Hospital, Jackson, Tennessee, Carl Perkins died at the age of 65 from throat cancer after suffering several strokes. Among those in attendance at the funeral at Lambuth University in 1998 were ex-Beatle George Harrison, Jerry Lee Lewis, Wynonna Judd, Garth Brooks, Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. He is interred at Ridgecrest Cemetery in Jackson, Tennessee.\n\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him #69 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\n\nCarl Perkins' wife, Valda deVere Perkins, died November 15, 2005 in Jackson, Tennessee.\n\nDrive-By Truckers, on their album The Dirty South, recorded a song \"Carl Perkins' Cadillac\" that gives a poignant history of the artist and his relationships.\n\nPerkins is the subject of an acclaimed biography, Go, Cat, Go, by noted New York-based music writer David McGee.\n\nPlans for a biographical film about Perkins have been announced by Santa Monica-based production company Fastlane Entertainment. \n\nCarl Perkins (pianist)\n\nCarl Perkins (born August 16, 1928, Indianapolis, Indiana, died March 17, 1958, Los Angeles, California) was an American jazz pianist.\nPerkins was born in Indianapolis but worked mainly in Los Angeles. He is best known for his performances with the Curtis Counce Quintet, which also featured Harold Land, Jack Sheldon and drummer Frank Butler. He also performed with the Clifford Brown\u2013Max Roach group in 1954, and recorded with Frank Morgan in 1955. Perkins composed the standard \"Grooveline.\"\nHis playing was influenced by his polio-affected left arm, which he held sideways over the keyboard.\nHe died of a drug overdose at age 29, having recorded one solo album, Introducing Carl Perkins, in 1955 and 1956. Authors Paul Tanner, Maurice Gerow, and David Megill cite Perkins as one of the best \"funky,\" or hard bop, piano players, but his early death prevented him from leaving a legacy.\n\t\nWith Chet Baker and Art Pepper\nPlayboys (Pacific Jazz, 1956)\nWith Dizzy Gillespie\nJazz Recital (Norgran, 1955)\nWith Dexter Gordon\nDexter Blows Hot and Cool (Boplicity, 1955)\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Carl+Perkins\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

comes down on you\nCries ring out as a chime for awakening\nTaking the time to listen up, maybe don't turn away\nMaybe showing interest could show them light of day\nLight of day, yeah\n\nWell, it's a

Companies seeking to survive in this era of digital transformation have realized that in today\u2019s data-driven economy, privacy has become the proxy for trust. If they allow their customers\u2019 privacy to be breached, then trust in the business relationship is lost.\n\nIn order to strengthen and enhance trust relationships with business partners and customers, companies are beginning to view data privacy compliance as a strategic differentiator. Previously, management\u2019s goal was \u201czero defects\u201d. With the advent of customer experience, the goal became \u201czero defections\u201d. Today, the goal is \u201czero breaches\u201d.\n\nIn this learning session, participants will receive a copy of the workbook, \u201cA Data Driven Operations Management approach to Data Privacy Compliance\u201d and will be guided through key activities which are critical for complying with Republic Act 10173, the Data Privacy Act of 2012.\nThis learning session will be facilitated by Dondi Mapa, former Deputy Privacy Commissioner of the National Privacy Commission (NPC).

Note: All proceeds will go towards hiring the cinema and our next film Pensioners United. Austerity Fight is a 90 min documentary by Liverpool based filmmakers, Phil Maxwell & Hazuan Hashim The austerity policies of the Tories have targeted young and old. The NHS is chronically under funded and is being privatised. Students are leaving college with huge debts. Children, pensioners and the disabled are living in poverty and millions live precarious lives on \u2018zero hour contracts\u2019. Austerity Fight challenges the notion that we have to live in a world where public services are cut, worker\u2019s rights removed and poverty is a daily reality for millions. Austerity Fight champions equality, practical alternatives to Austerity and a vision of a world based on co-operation rather than the greed of a global super elite. This is the second screening in Liverpool since the film was premiered at London&#39;s East End Film Festival 2017, when it received the following critical acclaim: \u201cSuch an astonishing achievement. A rousing, current, passionate document of ordinary people fighting back. This important film needs widespread screening\u201d. Rachel Lichtenstein (Author). \u201cA wonderful film pulling off such an alternative voice to what we see on the mainstream media. Linking the devastating cuts going on in all services\u201d. Amanda Richardson (Award winning documentary maker - BAFTA/Grierson) \u201cExposes what Austerity means in so many spheres, and documents the movements fighting back through the voices of ordinary people of all generations. Beautifully filmed, it is a must see not just for you, but for the unions, community groups, workplaces you are part of. A great film.

Today, the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policies that were popular at the end of the last century are widely viewed as unfair, heavy-handed, even discriminatory. Yet as the tide of opinion has turned against the heavy use of school suspensions, many policies have tended once again to tie the hands of teachers and principals, this time with the explicit goal of reducing the use of \u201cexclusionary discipline,\u201d especially for disadvantaged groups. To what extent are such policies actually altering school practice\u2014and are those alterations doing good or harm? Are new approaches such as \u201crestorative justice\u201d having the intended effect? What are the pros and cons of limiting\u2014even banning\u2014suspensions for certain forms of misconduct? Are schools following the new mandates? Are racial disparities in discipline decreasing? Is it possible to reduce suspensions without causing more school and classroom disruption?\u00a0 Join us for a two-panel event on January 25 that will examine how to handle student misbehavior. The first panel will feature Matthew P. Steinberg, author of The Academic and Behavioral Consequences of Discipline Policy Reform, and Abigail Gray, author of Discipline in Context: Suspension, Climate, and PBIS in the School District of Philadelphia. A debate will follow between Cami Anderson, former superintendent in Newark and founder of the Discipline Revolution Project, and Michael J. Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute.

Authority Zero was started in 1994. The band has punk rock and reggae influences, with Bad Religion, Pennywise, and Sublime as heavy influences for the band. There is also an obvious Spanish/Portuguese influence in the band's music. \n\nThe band's latest album, entitled The Tipping Point was released on April 2nd 2013. The band toured with Rehab on the \"Lack of Luxury\" 2007 tour. This album is the final one featuring Jeremy Wood on bass, leaving in November 2006 due to personal differences within the band.\n\nLead singer Jason DeVore has also released material as a solo artist.\n\nAuthority Zero was started in 1994 when Bill Marcks met Jason DeVore at Westwood High School. Marcks didn't actually meet DeVore until the summer of 1995, until then Authority Zero consisted of two guitarists (Marcks & Jerry Douglas) and a drummer J.W. Gordon, all from Westwood. This trio put a few songs together without lyrics or basslines. When that summer rolled around, Douglas was expecting the yearly visit of his friend Jason DeVore, from Wyoming. Douglas introduced his long time friend and Marcks jokingly asked if he wanted to be their singer, soon later it was no joke.\n\nMarcks was impressed with DeVore's ability to \"write catchy songs in fifteen minutes with really sticky hooks\". The two quickly enlisted Jeremy Wood on bass. His experience with lead guitar and musical theory separated his bass playing from others'. Not just a \"follow along,\" his baselines were independent and yet fluid with the music. (Wood actually taught Marcks & Douglas how to play guitar). However, because of Gordon's commitment to the Air Force, his position as drummer soon had to be replaced. Fellow classmate, skateboarder, and drummer Daniel Garcia fit this empty stool like a missing puzzle piece. He brought a new charge and tempo that evolved Authority Zero's music into a faster, more complex, punk rock style. Eventually, however, differences and family obligations led to Garcia's exit from the group.\n\nMarcks, Douglas, DeVore, and Wood finally came upon Los Angeles native Jim Wilcox formerly of Welter/The New Militia who's tragic events ended the group, and he fittingly completed the Authority Zero's lineup. Later Douglas also left the group and joined the Air Force.\n\nAfter releasing a local EP that sold very well, Authority Zero released their debut album A Passage In Time in 2002 on Lava Records. The album featured a blend of genres including punk rock and reggae, with obvious Spanish and Portuguese influences. A Passage In Time included the hits \"One More Minute\" and \"Over Seasons\".\n\nThe success of A Passage In Time propelled the band into new popularity. Authority Zero appeared on many tours, such as Warped Tour, the No Use for a Name/The Starting Line tour, and Sum 41's \"Sum on Your Face\". The band has also toured with the likes of Everclear, Guttermouth and H2O.\n\nIn 2004, Authority Zero released Andiam\u00f3, again on Lava Records. \"Andiam\u00f3\" means literally \"We go\" in Italian, but can also be read as \"And I am Zero\", the title of their live DVD released following Andiam\u00f3. The album again featured a blend of genres and Spanish/Portuguese influences. Andiam\u00f3 is somewhat politically charged, evident in the songs \"Revolution\", \"A Thousand Years of War\", and the cover of the song \"Mexican Radio\", originally written by Wall of Voodoo (the version that appears on Andiam\u00f3 has lyric changes in order to make a statement against the 2003 invasion of Iraq). In the summer of 2006, Authority Zero released a live acoustic compilation album titled Rhythm and Booze on Suburban Noize Records.\n\nThe band's next album, entitled 12:34 was released on January 30, 2007. The track \"Courage\" was released as a single. The band recently toured with Rehab on the \"Lack of Luxury\" 2007 tour. This album is the final one featuring Jeremy Wood on bass, who left Authority Zero in November 2006 due to personal differences within the band.\n\nOn December 30th, 2008 Bill Marcks posted a blog on his MySpace stating he left the band to spend more time with his family and to focus 100 percent on his new band, Sanziggo.\n\nJason DeVore has also been working on a side project called The Bollox, an Irish punk band he started with longtime friends.\n\nIt has also been confirmed that Authority Zero is working on a new studio album to be released February of 2010.\n\nDean \"DJ\" Farmer resigned as the bass player on July 20, 2009 citing personal, business, and creative differences.\n\nJeremy Wood has rejoined Authority Zero as the bass player.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Authority+Zero\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

1995. Bassist Caithlin De Marrais, guitarist Kaia Fischer, and drummer William Kuehn formed the band in the late summer of 1995 and named the band after the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke. They're known for their poetic lyrics and resounding metaphors. The lineup never changed during their eleven-year career.\n\nIn its earlier days, the band had duel vocals performed by De Marrais and Fischer; later, De Marrais would become the lead vocalist in the majority of their songs. The band's many tours and intimate live shows at venues such as Brooklyn's Northsix (now Music Hall of Williamsburg), Washington, D.C.'s The Black Cat, Bowery Ballroom in NYC, and Chapel Hill's Cat's Cradle helped to grow its fan base and fuel album sales.\n\nOn November 6, 2006, the band announced, through Pitchfork Media, that the December 16th show at New York City's Bowery Ballroom would be their last. They played one more show on December 17th at Northsix, which De Marrais referred to as \"home\" because it also served as the band's rehearsal space.\n\nThe band reformed in 2014 with a reunion show at Bowery Ballroom on December 31. Additional shows were added for February 14 and April 18, 2015 at Lincoln Hall in Chicago and Union Transfer in Philadelphia, respectively.

Tony Touch A.K.A Tony Toca continues to be a force to be reckoned with. Tony Touch, an icon in Hip Hop and in the Urban Hispanic genre plus seasoned player in the game, is a true innovator and has revolutionized the DJ game over and over. From his legendary mix tapes, to his skills on the 1\u2019s and 2\u2019s, he has become one of Hip Hop\u2019s most recognized DJ\u2019s. This C.E.O/Artist/Producer is now currently working on his 7th commercial release titled \u201cThe Piece Maker 3\u2026Return of the 50 MC\u2019s\u201d and is expected to make history once again. Tony Touch began as a B-Boy during the rap music renaissance era of the early 80\u2019s. Heavily influenced by pioneers like the Rock Steady Crew, Grandmaster Flash, Red Alert, \u201dLittle\u201d Louie Vega, and Jam Master Jay, he quickly shifted his interests towards the turntables. Toca is known for his legendary mix tapes like the original 50 MC\u2019s parts 1, 2 and 3. Included in this series are some of the hottest artists in the game such as KRS ONE, Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane, Wyclef, M.O.P., Big L, Mos Def and many more all coming together for one collective piece. This along with the countless other mix tapes, Tony became recognized in the streets and industry as the real \u2018Mix Tape King.\u2019 Tony Toca evolved his mix tapes to record releases. In 2000, Tony released \u201cThe Piece Maker\u201d on Tommy Boy records. This album sold over 400,000 units worldwide and featured legendary artists like Big Pun, Cypress Hill, Wu Tang Clan, Busta Rhymes, Eminem, Gang Starr, and much more. The video for the single \u201cI Wonder Why\u201d featuring Total featured cameos from John Leguizamo, Rock Steady and more. Since then, Tony Touch has released the \u201cPiece Maker 2\u201d which also had an all-star line up with features such as P. Diddy, Fat Joe, Sean Paul, Snoop Dog and even the legendary Ruben Blades. Toca is also known to represent the Latino community to the fullest. It is the result of growing up with Salsa at home and Hip-Hop influence in his lifestyle. In 2005 Tony inked a deal with EMI Records and revolutionized the game once more with his Latin album called \u201cReggaeTony\u201d. The hit single, \u201cPlay that Song\u201d featured Nina Sky and B-Real of Cypress Hill. The cd had an all star line up including Tego Calderon, Ivy Queen, Zion y Lennox, N.O.R.E, Voltio, and Soni just to name a few. The album went GOLD and with that success, EMI records moved quickly to release ReggaeTony 2 which featured more heavyweight appearances. Touch continues to be in demand globally. The proof is in the passport as he has toured over 30 countries including Japan, Australia, Puerto Rico, London, France, Greece, Russia, Brazil, Germany, Columbia, Switzerland, Italy and Cuba. He\u2019s also acted as tour DJ for acts like Cypress Hill, Gurus\u2019 Jazzmatazz, Rock Steady and the Beatnuts. You also may have caught Tony on TV shows such as \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cThe Dave Chapelle Show\u201d spinning for Eminem. And you may have heard him on the airwaves in New York City on such stations as Hot 97, Power 105, and 107.5 WBLS. In 2004, Eminem and manager Paul Rosenberg closed a deal for their own radio station on Sirius XM Satellite called Shade 45. Tony Touch was quickly recruited to host TOCA TUESDAYS from 8pm to Midnight. TOCA TUESDAYS is also a weekly classic Hip Hop party in which he invites legendary DJ\u2019s to guest spin. And if that weren\u2019t enough, another weekly party Tony sparked was the FUNKBOX where he plays deep house music with celeb guest DJ\u2019s. Both parties have been running over 4 years strong. <br>21+ Ages", "img": null, "title": "Tony Touch presented by E&J Certified", "url": "http://albuquerque.eventful.com/events/tony-touch-presented-ej-certified-/E0-001-109767240-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Sister Albuquerque", "city": "Albuquerque"}], "description": "There are currently two groups:\n\n1. A American Hip Hop group.\n\n2. A Japanese instrumental latin jazz-fusion group.\n\n\n1. The Beatnuts are a hip hop group and production duo from Queens, New York City. Its current members are JuJu and Psycho Les. JuJu (born Jerry Tineo on December 4, 1968) is Dominican American from Corona and Psycho Les (born Lester Fernandez on April 10, 1972) is a Colombian American from Jackson Heights. The Beatnuts were originally a trio before Kool Fashion, now known as Al' Tariq, left the group to start a solo career. The Mighty V.I.C. (Groove Merchantz, Ghetto Pros) was also a member of The Beatnuts' production team for a while.\n\nEarly on in their career they produced whole albums for Posse members Common Sense and Chi-Ali. Their production is noted as some of the finest and most accomplished, if unheralded, in all of hip-hop, often intricately detailed (as in their finely honed work for Mos Def on two tracks from Black on Both Sides) but more regularly barnstorming, club-friendly, flourish-laden party music. Jennifer Lopez used their track \"Watch Out Now\" as the instrumental for her song \"Jenny from the Block\". The Beatnuts produced more songs for the artists they had previously collaborated with as well as Fat Joe, Supr\u00eame NTM and Da Youngsta's. At the same time, The Beatnuts made their name as remix specialists by remixing songs for MC Lyte, Da Lench Mob, Naughty by Nature, Jomanda and others.\n\nThe Beatnuts are noted for being unabashedly, bullishly ribald and in-your-face performers. Recent Beatnuts albums are characterised by more Latin influences.\n\nLess known is they are considered part of the Native Tongues collective. The Beatnuts are the only Latino members of the Native Tongues collective.

The 2-CD mix set is a sweeping change from anything you would have previously expected to hear from the Deep Dish member and it features the finest in house, electro, techno, and even industrial music.\n\nGrowing up in the Washington, DC area, Dubfire spent much of his youth playing the guitar in school bands and listening to heavy doses of classic Hip-Hop, jazz/rare groove, dub reggae, new wave and industrial. Dubfire was also influenced by the local punk scene and the music of hometown bands like Fugazi and Minor Threat. Members of these bands also worked at a local record store called Yesterday And Today Records, and this is where Dubfire first picked up on the sounds of acts such as Kraftwerk, Ministry, Jesus & Mary Chain, Depeche Mode, Nitzer Ebb, Adrian Sherwood/On-U Sound and Einsturzende Neubauten. Through this heavy industrial influence, namely the sound of Chicago\u2019s famed Wax Trax! label, Dubfire discovered the Chicago house scene and what labels like Trax and D.J. International Records were releasing.\n\nDubfire\u2019s eclectic new mix is the product of his diverse past and addictive music personality, and this mix is more about Dubfire personally and as a DJ. Dubfire\u2019s mix was compiled with tracks that he\u2019s both really into at the moment and that have also had a profound influence on shaping his love for music. Dubfire GU31 \u2013 Taipei is laced full of gems from a diverse lot including Depeche Mode, Carl Craig, Booka Shade, Extrawelt, Samuel L Session and Nitzer Ebb. However, the biggest surprise of all comes with Dubfire\u2019s original production \u201cI Feel Speed;\u201d a cover of an obscure Love & Rockets song that, for the first time, features his own vocals!  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dubfire\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The very first life track was Justice and their single &quot;D.A.N.C.E&quot; which inspired Oliver to explore producing music on a more serious note.Going to a specialist music school and playing the drums created influences that will stay with him forever. He fondly recalls his teacher telling him he would never makeit in the music industry as he couldnt read note-sheets, he learnt everything himself through pure listening.Inspiration came from a broadrange and style of music and influences. Artists like Toto, Peter Gabriel and Jamiroquai all the way through to Ed Banger, Kavinsky, Goldroom and Ben Khan.Using Reason and Abletonit was some 3 years before Oliver felt he had perfected his workenough to actually put it online and let others hear his music.

Having already gained props from industry heavy weights such as Duke Dumont, Tensnake, Gorgon City and The Magician, the last 18 months have been nothing short of defining for this on-form duo.\n\nHaving grown up together from a young age, Lewis and Laurie have created a unique production recipe that is firmly focused on the art of creating organics, multi-dimensional music. Drawing on their experiences as musicians - Laurie playing the drums, and Lewis playing guitar - their productions start from simple grooves that slowly introduce the smooth and addictive melodies that the boys have become so known for.\n\n2013 saw Just Kiddin make their introduction via Nurvous Records with the \u2018Intimacy\u2019 EP. After being premiered by XLR8R, the online support poured in with features on Do You Like That Sound and Gotta Dance Dirty to name but a few. \n\nWith a new fan base developing, their eagerly awaited follow up release \u2018Time, Space & Honey\u2019 came on Ministry Of Sound\u2019s underground imprint HK Records. The online support was overwhelming with features on Clash, Noisey, Sub Soul, Topman CTRL and Eton Messy, which saw Just Kiddin starting to play shows around the UK alongside acts such as Bohdi, Second City, Leftwing & Kody and Cause & Effect.\n\nComing from a musical and DJ background, their club performances have also brought rapturous acclaim. Breaking the mould of the laborious bedroom producer turn DJ - Just Kiddin are a welcomed breath of fresh air behind the booth, bringing charisma, energy and faultless tune selection at any given time of the night. Such skills have won them numerous plaudits from promoters and clubbers a like, showing signs that they have what it takes to take centre stage.\n\nJust Kiddin\u2019s breakthrough came when they were invited to remix Claptone\u2019s summer hit \u2018No Eyes\u2019 on Exploited Records. Their remix was premiered exclusively by Mixmag and went on to feature in their Top 10 Exclusive Downloads of 2013 at #4, garnering a cool three million views on YouTube channel The Sound You Need along the way. \n\nThey were quick to react with a special free download on Eton Messy Records called \u2018Feeling Better\u2019. Having been a prominent feature in their sets over the summer, \u2018Feeling Better\u2019 caught the attention of Rob Da Bank on BBC Radio 1, who dedicated the track to all of his fellow DJ\u2019s and friends that had been in Ibiza with him that season. A fitting tribute to such a sun soaked song. Further Radio 1 support came from B.Traits, Monki and Phil & Alice - making the release a huge success.\n\nClosing the year with a double feature on Black Butter Records \u2018Spread Love Vol. 3\u2019 compilation, Just Kiddin have laid the foundations for a glittering 2014 - starting proceedings with a bona fide summer anthem \u2018Thinking About It\u2019 that is already picking up serious attention. \n\nSince being secretly premiered as the opening track on The Magician\u2019s \u2018Magic Tape 41\u2019, and featuring as an untitled track on Soundcloud channel #Unknown, \u2018Thinking About It\u2019 has instantly caught the attention of music lovers worldwide and initially generated an online hunt to unveil it\u2019s creator. This interest led to US based online tastemaker Thump! posting a feature entitled \u2018The Magician knows how to pick a winner\u2019 where they stated \u2018whatever song he uses to start off his mix inevitably becomes internet sensation\u2019. Having collected over 200,000 plays across Soundcloud and YouTube already, they have not been wrong thus far.\n\nSet for release on Eton Messy Records this summer, \u2018Thinking About It\u2019 is the first in a new series of original music to come from this exciting duo. Having already broken out into Lithuania, France, Belgium and Spain respectively - the word is fast spreading that Just Kiddin have exactly what it takes to be the UK\u2019s next breakthrough act.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Just+Kiddin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Heute, nach sieben offiziellen Rough Trade Alben und einigen zus*tzlichen Eigenver*ffentlichungen und Nebenprojekten, bereisen Jeffrey Lewis und seine zahlreichen Bandmitglieder die ganze Welt und haben sich eine treue Fangemeinde erspielt, die von L.A. bis London, Melbourne bis Moskau, Chicago bis Shanghai und weit dar*ber hinaus reicht.<br><br> Jeffrey spielte bereits mit Gr***en wie The Vaselines, The Fall, Stephen Malkmus & The Jicks, Roky Erickson, The Mountain Goats, Daniel Johnston, Pulp und unz*hligen anderen. <br><br> Nicht nur ist er ein Meister darin, tiefsinnige Folkgeschichten mit garageigem Indie-Punk zu verbinden, er ist auch ein gro*artiger Comiczeichner- und K*nstler und bekannt daf*r, eigene Illustrationen bei Konzerten live in seine Lieder einzubauen. <br><br> Aktuell ist Jeffrey mit seiner Band als &quot;Jeffrey Lewis & Los Bolts&quot; unterwegs, die Mitglieder von Cat Tatt, Fem Doms, Dufus und Moldy Peaches beinhaltet. Manchmal ist auch sein Bruder Jack f*r einen Gastauftritt dabei. <br><br> Jeffrey hat bereits zw*lf Ausgaben seiner Comicbuch-Reihe &quot;Fuff&quot; herausgebracht.

Though by no means devoid of\u00a0nuance and detail, the first thing one notices while standing in front of the band as they begin to unleash\u00a0their stage show, is the feeling of being blown back by a whirlwind of energy and power, concocted by three guys locked in a groove. Led by Stratocaster genius\u00a0Parker Griggs, RADIO MOSCOW have carved their own sonic niche fusing crunching, heavy Sabbath-style chords with fiery \u2018Hendrixian\u2019 solos and a raw intensity\u00a0that is addictive and captivating, also citing the likes of Cream, Blue Cheer and Led Zeppelin as further influences. Now, RADIO MOSCOW are gearing up for an\u00a0exciting new chapter in their career with the release of the fifth studio album \u201cNew Beginnings\u201d on Century Media Records.<br><br> Formed in 2003 by Parker Griggs in Ames, Iowa, the band has been based in San Diego county, California,\u00a0for several years now. Parker is joined by Paul Marrone on drums and bassist Anthony Meier. RADIO MOSCOW\u00a0has released four studio albums to date: \u201cRadio Moscow\u201d - produced by The Black Keys\u2019 Dan Auerbach, who\u00a0introduced the band to Alive Natural Sound records, the label that has released every record up until now - \u201cBrain Cycles\u201d,\u00a0\u201cThe Great Escape of Leslie Magnafuzz\u201d, and \u201cMagical Dirt\u201d. Alive also released the early, garage demos collection \u201c3 and 3 Quarters\u201d,\u00a0and the live record, \u201cLive in California\u201d, which New York Music Daily cited as the Best Heavy Psych Album\u00a0of 2016.<br><br> Since the live album was released, RADIO MOSCOW has made the leap to a worldwide deal with Century\u00a0Media Records, said Parker Griggs, \u201cWe couldn&#39;t be more stoked to be joining the Century Media family!\u00a0When we met these guys we spent hours nerding out on obscure classics from our favorite era of rock \u2018n\u2019\u00a0roll (1965-1974).... so we feel right at home!\u201d<br><br> The first result of this new collaboration is \u201cNew Beginnings\u201d, which offers a powerful 10-track blues rock\u00a0ride which was recorded at Lost Ark Studio in San Diego with Mike Butler, produced by the band\u2019s own\u00a0Parker Griggs, and mastered by Mark Chalecki at Little Red Book Mastering. From the bursting guitar licks\u00a0of opening track \u201cNew Beginning\u201d over to the road dog anthem \u201cDriftin\u2019\u201d and the Hendrix-like groove of\u00a0\u201cNo One Knows Where They\u2019ve Been\u201d, from the pounding \u201cPacing\u201d to moody album closer \u201cDreams\u201d,\u00a0RADIO MOSCOW present an authentic and electrifying mix of versatile guitar play, the passionate raw howl\u00a0of Parker Griggs and a tight, energetic rhythm section.<br><br> Known as a brilliant live act, RADIO MOSCOW have toured and performed with the likes of Graveyard,\u00a0Witchcraft, Joe Bonamassa, Pentagram, the Sheepdogs, Nebula, and Bang. They played the Up in Smoke\u00a0tour in Europe (with Colour Haze) which included an appearance on the legendary German television\u00a0program Rockpalast, where the band performed a set, played acoustic and were interviewed. In 2016 they\u00a0played the Ride Festival, Desert Daze, Electric Funeral, End Hip End It, the Psycho California festival, and\u00a0as is only appropriate, have headlined shows in both St. Petersburg and Moscow in Russia. Also for \u201cNew\u00a0Beginnings\u201d, RADIO MOSCOW will tour internationally, US dates were completed in June/July 2017, UK dates are confirmed for August, and a full European tour kicks off September 26th, 2017. So if you are\u00a0looking for the fine art of rock, RADIO MOSCOW will bring waves of fuzzy, hard rocking riffs and sweaty,\u00a0cranked up blues right to you!\u00a0RADIO MOSCOW \u2013 New Beginnings<br><br><br><br> In a time where everybody has to put a label on a band to try and separate or distinguish what kind of music they play, Amplified Heat adopts Lemmy from Motorhead&#39;s philosophy....ROCK AND ROLL! Emitting a truly menacing blues psych-rock sound from four massive walls of double stacked Marshall and Fender cabinets and a 1966 Ludwig drum kit in between - Amplified Heat continues the Texas tradition of pure, fearless rock and roll. <br><br> From Cali, Colombia the Ortiz brothers have been playing music together since the early 90\u2019s and formed Amplified Heat in 2003. Based on a tradition of bone rattling blues they take a direct approach to intense riff slinging - never pulling punches and delivering the real deal with every sonic tsunami they unleash. The band has released four full length EP\u2019s and their next album \u201cMadera\u201d is due out in early 2018. The band\u2019s sound pulls from a variety of influences including Cream, Jimi Hendrix, Black Sabbath, Canned Heat, Motorhead, ZZ top, and Deep Purple. <br><br> Amplified Heat has shared the stage with Blue Cheer, The Black Angels, Clutch, Thee Oh Sees, Honky, Atomic Bitchwax, Kylesa, Kadavar, Ian Moore, Dead Meadow, Corky Lang\u2019s Mountain, Buffalo Killers, Nashville Pussy, Dresden 45, and Roky Erickson amongst many others. They make multiple appearances every year at Austin\u2019s South by Southwest Festival, have played at Ohio based Emissions from the Monolith Festival, and Oakland California\u2019s Burger Bugaloo. <br><br><a href=\"http://bit.ly/RadioMoscow0103TIX\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>", "img": null, "title": "RADIO MOSCOW", "url": "http://atlanta.eventful.com/events/radio-moscow-/E0-001-109215124-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Center Stage", "city": "Atlanta"}], "description": "Roky Erickson (born Roger Kynard Erickson on July 15, 1947) is an American singer, songwriter, harmonica player and guitarist from Austin, Texas. He was a founding member of the 13th Floor Elevators, who are considered to be one of the first two bands to ever use the word \"psychedelic\" ( + see The Deep) to describe rock music. See also Roky Erickson & the Aliens and Roky Erickson & The Explosives.\n\nIn 1969 the band were all arrested for possession of marijuana and Roky was incarcerated in Rusk State Hospital for the Criminally Insane where he reportedly underwent electroshock therapy and was placed on Thorazine amongst other controversial treatments. Many claim he has never been the same since. Sadly in the intervening years record execs and managers displayed the bad side of the music business and took full advantage of his condition often leaving him living in poverty while they hoarded all the cash.\n\nIn 2001 Roky's youngest brother, Sumner Erickson (ex-tuba player for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra), was appointed his legal guardian and an improvement in Roky's faculties has been reported since, leading to a return to live shows.\n\nAn excellent documentary on Roky, \"You're gonna miss me\" (2005), chronicled his troubled life - his schizophrenia, incarceration for possession of a joint, and talented and eccentric family.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Roky+Erickson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Bart Crow is coming your way.<p>Always known as \u201cthe nice guy\u201d with a smile on his face, the tides are turning and the gloves are coming off. Bart Crow is still the kind of guy and artist fans in the South and Midwest have grown to love. But on his new album The Parade, boundaries disappear and things are getting real.<p>The road-toughened troubadour and his band have already logged thousands of miles playing 130+ dates a year in front of loyal rowdy crowds at far-flung, late-night clubs and concert halls all over Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Nebraska and beyond. It\u2019s his music that draws them \u2014 a tangle of roots in blues, country and down-home rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, branded with his unique imprint. They hear their lives in his lyrics, written in the tradition of Townes Van Zandt, Steve Earle and other true-life troubadours.<p>With no help from big-time labels, and money pulled from his own pockets, Crow has put together an admirable track record as a recording artist, having lofted six No. 1 singles onto the Texas Music Chart \u2013 one of which, \u201cWear My Ring,\u201d sold over 165,000 copies. He has sold over 40,000 albums, released five self-produced albums in just over a decade, including Dandelion, which debuted at No. 1 on Billboard\u2018s Heatseekers South Central chart. He\u2019s been cheered in Country Weekly, on CMT and in other national media outlets. His YouTube videos and concert footage have drawn more than 2.5 million views.<p>He\u2019s chiseled his foothold in the edifice of Americana through hard work, talent, determination and a deep love for making music and building the best life he can for his wife Brooke and three kids, Townes and twins River and Parsons.<p>Myriad spirits haunt his music\u2013 a choir of real American country in the fashion of Merle and Waylon, John Conlee, George Jones and Jerry Jeff Walker, razor-edged rock from Metallica, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, deep-fried Southern soul from Otis Redding and more.<p>Yet in the end, Bart Crow is what you get: a blue-collar balladeer with his own unique message.<p>It comes across loud and clear on his newest set of passionate songs and performances, The Parade. Released in partnership with Thirty Tigers, it spotlights an artist whose story will feel familiar to all Americans who know what it means to survive in challenging times.<p>\u201cI can relate to blue-collar folks everywhere because I don\u2019t know any difference between them and me,\u201d he insists. \u201cMy uncle is a fireman who works on a ranch on his days off. My other uncle is a fireman. My brother works as a construction superintendent. I\u2019ve worked construction too. I\u2019ve stained decks and built fences in 110-degree weather. My father grew up white-trash broke, a ninth-grade dropout. He eventually became a self-made multi-millionaire with his own commercial drywall corporation, but we didn\u2019t have luxury growing up.\u201d<p>Another uncle stoked Crow\u2019s imagination about living a wanderer\u2019s life. \u201cHe was a professional rodeo cowboy,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI used to think that was the most amazing thing on the planet. He\u2019d come home from two or three weeks on the road and tell stories about being in Cheyenne and then somewhere else the last night. Even more than music, this idea of the nomadic lifestyle was very romantic to me.\u201d<p>This perspective is central to The Parade, with the added element of Crow\u2019s experiences. He grew up in tiny Maypearl, Texas, made his first attempts to write songs while in the United States Army and geared up to his current regimen as a performer on weekends while studying at Tarleton State University in Stephenville, TX. Perhaps the most significant milestone in his past involved moving with his future wife Brooke to Austin, where they worked together to get him started as an artist.<p>\u201cI guess we just don\u2019t know any different way to live than with me gone for six or eight months a year. After a decade-plus, this is just who we are. This is what we do. Besides,\u201d he adds, with a laugh, \u201cit\u2019s probably the foundation of our marriage that my knucklehead ass is gone a lot.\u201d<p>Like the border that divides his hometown from dreams of what lies beyond in his song \u201cCity Limits Signs,\u201d Crow\u2019s boundaries are dissolving. Wedding plainspoken poetry to powerful hooks and grooves, The Parade transforms daily occurrences into stories with universal resonance.<p>Not everyone has spent months far from home as Crow documents with irony on \u201cFree Like Me,\u201d dreamy loneliness on \u201cVapor Trails\u201d and truth telling love affair with music on \u201cDear Music,\u201d where he finds himself in \u201canother where-the-hell-am-I town.\u201d<p>Fewer still have weathered years on the honky-tonk circuit while staying faithful to their dream, a struggle Crow recounts on \u201cTop of Rock Bottom.\u201d (\u201cI won\u2019t be laying down on that Florida-Georgia Line,\u201d he sings, with what he insists is respect and empathy.)<p>Still, whether you\u2019ve fought to keep your own business alive or adapt to a soul-grinding cubicle gig, you\u2019ll get the message. And if you\u2019ve been burned or saved by love, you\u2019ll see yourself in the deft imagery of \u201cQueen of the Heartache Parade,\u201d the sweet pain of \u201cOne Night with You,\u201d the worldly-wise \u201cHere We Go Again\u201d and the insights that weave throughout \u201cLife Comes at You Fast.\u201d<p>New listeners may go beyond enjoying The Parade to identify with Crow as someone who knows first-hand the challenges of balancing one\u2019s dreams, integrity, responsibilities and reality.<p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty damn scary when you\u2019re raising a family off of touring and it becomes time to cut a new album, which means investing up to $70,000 of my own money,\u201d he admits. \u201cMy 4-year-old, Townes, starts preschool in August. Our 17-month-old twins, River and Parsons, are blowing through diapers left and right. And I\u2019ve got to take money that could be going to their college funds, more money than I have in my personal checking account, sit down at the crap table of life, roll the dice and hope that someone falls in love with the 11 or 12 songs we picked.\u201d<p>That\u2019s why Crow\u2019s dream at this point involves more than spreading appreciation for his music from coast to coast. \u201cI want to go to Seattle and Spokane and all the West and East Coast spots and the South, to DC and Manhattan and Connecticut. and have people show up and sing along with us,\u201d he insists. \u201cI want to hear people all over America come up to me and say, \u2018Hey, we got married to your song!\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Have you been on iTunes? Do you know how many frigging songs are on there \u2014 and you chose mine?\u2019 I don\u2019t take that lightly.\u201d<p>No, more even than that, he wants what everyone who discovers his music wants as well. \u201cI\u2019d love to go to bed at night and not fear for what\u2019s going to happen next month or next year. I used to say, when we bought our tour bus, we were one backstroke away from being dead in the water. It would be nice to earn that through selling tickets and playing in so many of these beautiful cities I\u2019d love to see.\u201d<p>That dream is within reach now, because Crow\u2019s story is your story too. All you need to do is listen \u2014 and join The Parade.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>", "img": null, "title": "Bart Crow", "url": "http://littlerock.eventful.com/events/bart-crow-/E0-001-110348521-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Stickyz Rock N Roll Chicken Shack", "city": "Little Rock"}], "description": "The Alexandrov Ensemble (also known as the Red Army Choir) is an official army choir of the Russian armed forces.

In 1978 the word \"academic\" was added to the title (A. V. Alexandrov Twice Red-bannered and Red-starred Academic Song and Dance Ensemble of the Soviet Army). After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the ensemble received its present name in 1998.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army_Choir <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Red+Army+Choir\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He began piano lessons promptly at age 5, studying at The University Of Michigan School Of Music Pedagogy program. By his early teens Andrew had already exhibited great enthusiasm and talent for both music and the visual arts. He spent his high school years playing drums and keyboard in an almost endless variety of short-lived, but passionate groups, all centered in southeast Michigan's explosive cultural scene. By the age of 17, Andrew had graduated from high school - one year early - in an effort to dedicate all his time to his creative endeavors. He was accepted to The School Of The Art Institute Of Chicago, but instead chose to move to New York City in 1997, at age 18, to pursue his vision alone.\n\nUpon arriving in New York, Andrew found odd jobs in art galleries, department stores, avant-garde fashion boutiques, selling opera tickets, and as a gumball machine salesman; anything to support his real interest: making the most exciting music he could. He pursued this goal day and night, putting all of his abilities and resources into the writing and recording of his own material. Shortening his name from Andrew Wilkes-Krier to Andrew W.K., he set out on a mission to get his music heard not only in New York, but also around the world. Without a band or even a partner, Andrew began performing solo concerts anywhere he could get them. Using only a keyboard, drum machine, and his voice, Andrew played shows up and down the east coast. He vowed to play any show, any place, any time, and wound up performing everywhere from coffee houses to basements. Quickly the word spread of the energy and raw excitement of Andrew and the music, and soon he found himself performing for larger crowds. After performing several shows with friends and fellow New York performers, Fishcerspooner, Andrew was invited to play 2 engagements at a popular Belgian Arts Festival called Over The Edges. This was only the very beginning of a fast and wild ride.\n\nAndrew signed a recording contract with Island Def Jam Records/Universal Music, and began the recording of his debut full-length CD. Titled I GET WET, the album's release in 2001 caused a widespread and diverse wave of reaction, landing Andrew on the covers of international music magazines, like the UK's NME, which featured him not once, but twice on the cover of the same issue (adding an additional page to accommodate the double image). More press followed, catapulting Andrew to overnight exposure in the international music world. Magazines worldwide praised the originality and undeniable intensity of his music, and articles in GQ, Rolling Stone, Spin, Q, Mojo, New York Magazine, Vanity Fair, Jane, The New Yorker, FHM, Playboy, Oui, The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Alternative Press, i-D, The Face, Dazed & Confused, Bizzare, Newsweek, The New York Post, Stuff, The Washington Post, The Village Voice, and dozens and dozens and dozens of others, the world over, all agreed that the A.W.K. style had made a mark in the wide world of music.\n\nNow that Andrew W.K. had arrived, it was time to take the music to the stage, and Andrew had to form a band. Instead of auditioning random applicants, Andrew decided to write a letter to his favorite drummer, a man named Donald Tardy, who plays in the band Obituary. Andrew sent Donald the music and asked if he would join his band. Having no expectations, Andrew was shocked when Tardy wrote back and agreed to play the music. After Donald came an additional 7 musicians, including Gregg Roberts (bass guitar, vocals), Sgt. Frank (guitar), Jimmy Coup (guitar, vocals), Kendall A. (guitar, vocals), E. Payne (guitar, vocals), John Sutton (guitar), and even a second drummer, Richie Russo, who played on stage next to Donald, in perfect synchronicity. Andrew relocated to Brandon, Florida, in order to rehearse with the band and prepare the music for live performances. Immediately following the release of I GET WET, Andrew W.K. and his newly formed band began a world tour, which would continue for 3 years and over 500 concerts. Major U.S. tours, including highly coveted Ozzfest and Warped Tour dates, as well as countless hall and arena shows with everyone from Aerosmith, to The Locust, gave the music even further exposure and proved that A.W.K. music goes beyond genre and classifaction - it seemed purely \"a man and music\". Major network television appearances on Saturday Night Live, Late Night With Conan O'Brien, Last Call With Carson Daly, The Daily Show With Jon Stewart, CNN, Fox Sports, Access Hollywood, Top Of The Pops, VH1, and MTV led to an eventual T.V. series of his own, entitled Your Friend, Andrew W.K. The show featured Andrew giving personal advice to fans who wrote in asking for help. MTV2 presented the series, along with countless other Andrew W.K. appearances on MTV, VH1, Much Music, and FUSE.\n\nIn the midst of his non-stop schedule, Andrew recorded and released his second album, THE WOLF, which was received with enthusiasm by both fans and the media alike. The album was recorded much in the same tradition Andrew established with his earliest songs: Andrew himself playing every instrument, and recording track after track of music, with each song tracking at least 90 individual parts, if not 200 or more individual tracks. Andrew and his band took the new album to the stage and performed tours across the globe, including festivals in Reading, Leeds, Tokyo, Osaka, and Taiwan. During this wave of shows, Andrew broke his foot on stage while getting tangled in his own microphone cable. Rather than sit it out and heal at home, W.K. decided to continue the tour, and played the remaining 60 shows in a wheelchair. One of these performances was filmed at the Spike T.V. Video Game Awards. Earlier in the year, W.K. had sustained a head injury during the filming of his music video, We Want Fun, with director Spike Jonze, for the Jackass Movie soundtrack. Despite these physical setbacks, the music continued and the party continues to spread, one person at a time.\n\nAt the close of 2004, Andrew began work on the massive WHO KNOWS? live-concert movie. In it, more than 300 hours of live concert footage, spanning 1992-2004, was condensed into a rapid-fire viewing experience. The film was edited using a special multi-track video process, in which multiple performances can be synchronized and layered together, with the audio and video overlapping to create a seamless sequence of shots from different concerts. The layering process of the video is similar to the layering process Andrew uses to record his music, and when performing. The movie was screened at sell-out shows in New York City and Hollywood, where Andrew performed in-person piano solos. WHO KNOWS? was released on DVD by Music Video Distributors / R. Jayne / R.C.U. Video.\n\nAndrew W.K. released his third album, entitled \"Close Calls With Brick Walls\" in Spring 2006. The album was released exclusively in Asia due to legal issues surrounding usage of the name \"Andrew W.K.\"  Andrew toured both South Korea and Japan extensively in 2006. .\n\nIn December 2009, a lecture recorded at Madame Jojo's in London in September 2008 was published online. In it Andrew W.K. claimed that the Andrew W.K. persona was created by a committee including himself, his father, and other individuals, and that he was the \"next person playing Andrew W.K.\" Claiming, \"I'm not the guy you've seen from the I Get Wet album... I'm not that same person. I don't just mean that in a philosophical or conceptual way. It's not the same person at all.\" Andrew W.K. later went on to clarify that he believed that he, as well as his fans that have followed him since the original album, have become \"different people.\"\n\nHe went further on to say: \"Andrew W.K. was created by a large group of people. They met, and I was there, and we talked about how we could come up with something that would move people. It was done in the spirit of commerce. It was done in the spirit of entertainment, which usually goes hand in hand with commerce. I was auditioned, along side many other people, to fill this role of a 'great frontman', 'a great performer'. On the one hand it may be a little scary to admit this to you all, that I may not be exactly who you thought I was, and that the guy who was, in fact, first hired as Andrew W.K. is a different person than the guy sitting here on the stage tonight. I'm the next person who is playing Andrew W.K.\"\n\nHowever On Tuesday 24 February, 2010, Andrew WK hosted an event Santos Party House in New York, where members of the public could ask him anything they liked.  He stated that \"I am Andrew W.K., the same that has been here from the beginning... I am... I am, I am the same Andrew W.K. at this appearance as at all Andrew W.K.-related appearances.\"\n\nLater in 2010 due to finding a loophole in his contractual agreements he was able to release his 2006 album \"Close Calls With Brick Walls\" world wide. He released this along with another album  called \"Mother Of Mankind\" which contained rare and unreleased tracks from 1999 right through to 2010. \nHe still lives in New York City.\n\nIn 2011, he released an EP called the \"Party all Goddamn night\" EP. This was released exclusively in Japan. Andrew W.K. is currently working on a new as yet unnamed album which is due for release some time in 2012.\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Andrew+W.K.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The singer who put the rude in rude boy, Max Romeo was responsible for launching an entirely new sub-genre of reggae, whose overtly suggestive lyrics caused an outcry but took a massive hold of the music scene regardless. Yet innuendo was the least of the singer's stylings, previous to the release of his infamous \"Wet Dream,\" Romeo had garnered a string of sweet hits with the vocal trio the Emotions. And once the nocturnal naughtiness faded, the singer established himself as one of the most important figures in the roots scene.\nHe left home at the age of 14 and worked on a sugar plantation outside Clarendon, cleaning out irrigation ditches, before winning a local talent competition when he was 18; prompting a move to the capital, Kingston, in order to achieve a successful musical career.\n\nIn 1965 he joined up with Kenneth Knight and Lloyd Shakespeare in The Emotions, whilst also working as a record plugger for Ken Lack's Caltone label. The group were unsuccessful in auditions for other producers, but Lack offered them an audition after overhearing Smith singing to himself as he worked one day. In 1966, the group had their first hit, with the Lack-produced, \"Buy You a Rainbow\". The Emotions went on to have several hit singles and by 1968, the singer, by this point known as Max Romeo, felt confident enough to launch a solo career. Working with producer Bunny Lee, the young star recorded a number of pop songs, mainly love ballads, but they failed to be popular and so he returned to The Emotions, now recording for Phil Pratt. During this time he began work as a sales representative for Bunny Lee and did some recording with The Hippy Boys, which would later became The Upsetters.\n\nLater on in 1968, Romeo wrote new lyrics for the rhythm track of Derrick Morgan's \"Hold You Jack\" and handed them over to Lee. Morgan, who was due to add his vocals to the track, ultimately gave it a miss, as did several other vocalists (including John Holt and Slim Smith), leading the producer to turn to Romeo to sing the lyrics he had written. The result, \"Wet Dream\", was an instant hit in Jamaica, although in the UK it was met with a BBC Radio ban, despite Romeo's somewhat-disingenuous claim that the song was actually about a roof that has a leak. Still, the ban only made it more popular and the single charted in the Top Ten, in the UK Singles Chart, spending almost six months therein, before featuring on his LP, A Dream, which included several follow-up singles in a similar vein, such as \"Mini Skirt Version\", \"Fish in the Pot\", \"Belly Woman\", and \"Wine Her Goosie\". A UK tour also met with Romeo being banned from performing at several venues, although many allowed him to play, the singer staying in the UK for eighteen months.\n\nIn 1970, Romeo returned to Jamaica and set-up Romax, an unsuccessful record label and sound system. Following which, he recorded several singles, mainly with old producer Bunny Lee, before going on to work a host of other producers including Niney Holness. This was followed by a period of which saw the release of a series of politically charged singles, most advocating the democratic socialist People's National Party (PNP), which chose his song, \"Let The Power Fall On I\", as their campaign theme for the 1972 Jamaican general election. Romeo joined the PNP Musical Bandwagon, travelling around Jamaica, playing on the back of a truck. After this, Romeo recorded a number of religious songs, until he worked with producer Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, producing the classic singles \"Three Blind Mice\" (an adaptation of the nursery rhyme with lyrics about a police raid on a party), \"Sipple Out Deh\", and \"Chase the Devil\". A remixed version of \"Sipple Out Deh\", entitled \"War Ina Babylon\", was another popular track in the UK, the first fruits of his deal with Island Records, and was followed by an album of the same name, and a follow-up single \"One Step Forward\". Shortly after this the pair fell out, leaving Romeo to self-produce his follow-up album, Reconstruction, which could not match the success of its predecessor. Perry's animosity towards Romeo was demonstrated by his single \"White Belly Rat\", with Perry also writing the word 'Judas' over a photograph of Romeo on the wall of his Black Ark studio.\n\nHe moved to New York City in 1978, where he co-wrote (with Hair producer Michael Butler) the musical, Reggae, which he also starred in. In 1980 he appeared as a backing vocalist on \"Dance\" on The Rolling Stones album Emotional Rescue. In 1981, the favour was returned when Keith Richards (of The Rolling Stones) co-produced and played on Romeo's album, Holding Out My Love to You. The rest of his output during the decade went practically unnoticed, with Romeo finding work at a New York electronics store. He returned to Jamaica in 1990, and began touring and recording more regularly.\n\nHe visited the UK again in 1992, recording the albums Far I Captain of My Ship and Our Rights with Jah Shaka. In 1995 he recorded Cross of the Gun with Tappa Zukie, and he joined up with UK rhythm section/production team Mafia & Fluxy in 1999 for the album Selassie I Forever.\n\nHis music has been sampled by other artists; The Prodigy sampled his track \"Chase the Devil\" for their 1992 UK Top Ten hit \"Out of Space\". Kanye West has also used samples from it to produce Jay-Z's hit song \"Lucifer\", which appeared on Jay-Z's 2003 release - The Black Album.\n\n\"Chase the Devil\" is featured on the reggae radio station K-JAH Radio West in a popular videogame Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, released in October 2004. Romeo's single \"Sipple Out Deh\" appeared in John Peel's Record Box.\n\n\n- Albums:\nA Dream (1970) Trojan \nLet The Power Fall (1972) Dynamic \nRevelation Time (1975) Black World \nWar Ina Babylon (1976) Island \nReconstruction (1979) Island \nI Love My Music (1979) Wackies \nRondos (1980) King Kong \nHolding Out My Love to You (1981) Shanachie \nTransition (1989) Rohit \nFari - Captain of My Ship (1992) Jah Shaka \nOur Rights (1992) Jah Shaka \nCross or the Gun (1995) Tappa Zukie \nSelassie I Forever (1999) Mafia & Fluxy \nLove Message (1999) Warriors \nSomething is Wrong (1999) Warriors \nIn This Time (2001) 3D (Max Romeo & Tribu Acustica) \nPocomania Songs (2007) Ariwa Sounds \n- Compilations:\nMax Romeo Meets Owen Gray At King Tubby's Studio (1984) Culture Press (with Owen Gray) \nMax Romeo and the Upsetters (1989) \nWet Dream (1993) Crocodisc \nMcCabee Version (1995) Sonic Sounds \nOpen The Iron Gate (1999) Blood & Fire \nThe Many Moods of Max Romeo (1999) Jamaican Gold \nPray For Me: The Best of Max Romeo 1967-73 (2000) Trojan Records \nPerilous Times (2000) Charmax \nOn The Beach (2001) Culture Press \nThe Coming of Jah (2002) Trojan \nUltimate Collection (2003) (compiled by David Katz) \nHoly Zion (2003) Burning Bush \nWet Dream: The Best of Max Romeo (2004) Trojan \nCrazy World of Dub (2005) Jamaican Recordings \n\nOne of Jamaica's most provocative lyricists, a singer who gave us such enduring songs as 'Chase The Devil' (which was sampled in the song 'Out of Space' by The Prodigy and the song 'Lucifer' by Jay-Z), 'Public Enemy Number One', 'One Step Forward' and 'Three Blind Mice'. It was Romeo who first introduced Britain to the concept of rude reggae with 'Wet Dream', which, despite a total radio ban, reached number 10 in the UK charts in May 1969.\nIn 1972 Romeo began working with producer Lee \"Scratch\" Perry. 'Babylon Burning', 'Three Blind Mice' and 'The Coming Of Jah' all maintained his star status in Jamaica between 1972 and 1975. Revelation Time was one of the best albums of 1975, and 1976's War Ina Babylon was hailed by the rock press as an all-time classic reggae album. Two outstanding contributions that will remain classic recordings from the so-called \u2018golden age\u2019 of Jamaican reggae music. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Max+Romeo\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Around 4000 tales are held within the mind and recalled on request, using the lost art of \u2018stories within stories\u2019. This weekend is an opportunity to gain an insight into how a culture thrived before the written word became common practice.Starting at one point in the lattice we the listeners will guide the journey through the interlinked tales, hearing stories possibly left untold for two generations. There will be time for discussion and exploration of both the tradition and the stories. The Sapphire Staff: Part 2 6-8 April 2018 All the tellings stand alone but if you choose to journey with us on one, or more, of the weekends you will experience the thrill of old friends and foes making an appearance, and witness how the story cycles enfold one into another. The group will be able to interact in the way it was originally intended, asking questions directly about the stories and the environment in which they were told; from finding hidden trade routes locked within the tales, to the reasons why a person might forgo a story in order to hear one of greater importance to the community. Shonaleigh is the only known Drut\u2019syla and the weekend will be a thoroughly unusual revival of a culture almost lost. The telling will start at 7.30pm on Friday evening and finish at noon on Sunday. It will take place within a relaxed atmosphere with plenty of cushions and sofas and tea, coffee and cake provided at regular intervals. This is an unmissable opportunity for anyone interested in stories or in oral and lost cultures to come and help document and archive through listening, requesting stories and asking questions.

At the moment they are living out of Berlin an inspirational frontier that is allowing them to enlarge their bonds.Their music and productions are a mixture of new sounds and genres ranging from pop to house, nu/disco to rock with everything in between, music that can make people dance feeling their deepest emotions come alive.\n\nThe first full debut release of the duo will be out on 'Visionquest' (Label of Seth Troxler, Ryan Crosson, Shaun Reeves & Lee Curtiss) in Spring 2011 whilst tracks already appear on labels such as 'Barraca Music', 'Cocoon' and 'Life & Death'. Various collaborations took place in 2010 alongside fellow 'Visionquest' label mates Shaun Reeves & Ryan Crosson for critically acclaimed remixes and EP's. In particular the Tale Of Us remix on 'Life & Death' (Thugfucker - Disco Gnome) has seen them achieve much praise, airplay and success in record sales. Future remixes on the horizon sees the duo try their hand at something totally different with a dynamic remix for an upcoming album of the rock band 'Who Made Who' which fuses together both rock and techno whilst managing to create something incredibly raw and interesting.\n\nKarm & Matteo have already played in clubs such as Watergate, Weekend, Privilege, Tenax, Barraca & DC10 and have been throwing secret loft parties in their hometown of Milan, known as 'Just This'. Such a wide range of clubs already played illustrates the natural talent in both and production and performing, helped in part due to their expansive understanding and knowledge of all variations of music.\n\nUpcoming events will see them perform both Live & DJ sets at locations around the world during WMC at Miami, at Detroit Movement Festival (DEMF),or Sonar Barcellona,they are also officially booked at Klubber's Day Madrid,Fiesta Privada Rome, Elita Festival Milan and many other quality venues through Europe.\n\nStay tuned for this growing Tale...\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tale+of+Us\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Im Februar 2005 und im Juli 2006 nahm Selwyn Miller, der in New Orleans lebende Manager von unter anderem David Gates, Bread, Randy Crawford und Petula Clark, ihn mit nach New Orleans um dort sein herausragendes Talent zu zeigen. Im Jahr 2006 ehrte der Musikkonzern Fender sein Talent und machte ihn als einen von sechs Musikern weltweit zu ihrem Testimonial f\u00fcr ihre Gitarren und Verst\u00e4rker. Als DAN seinen Groove gefunden hatte, folgte eine Flut von brillant ausgef\u00fchrten elektrischen und akustischen Bluesalben: 2006 REAL, 2009 MOVE MY SOUL, 2012 20 STONES und das Unplugged Wunder aus dem Jahr 2013 WOODEN THOUGHTS.

Her follow up solo efforts included \"'One Day I'll Fly Away\" (1980, Grand Prize for Tokyo International Music Festival); \"You Might Need Somebody\" (1981); and \"Rainy Night In Georgia\" (1981); which all became soul standards. Secret Combination (1981) stayed on the Billboard album chart for 60 weeks, after which her profile dipped, despite a return to the Top 10 with \"Almaz\" in (1986).\n\nNaked And True (1995) brought Crawford back to her roots: it included Benson's \"Give Me The Night\", and confirmed her soul heritage by featuring Funkadelicists Bootsy Collins, Bernie Worrell and The Fred Wesley Horns. But she enjoyed her highest profile of the decade when rising starlet Shola Ama had a worldwide hit with a cover of \"You Might Need Somebody\" in 1997.\n\nShe still continues to make great R&B hits and performs on various Jazz Festivals around the world. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Randy+Crawford\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

better\nWords to say\nAll I said was goodnight\nOnce again, in self-defence\nI won't sleep a wink\nTo prevent dreaming of you\n\nYou can sleep in your own bed tonight\nSleep away\nA silent pain\nThat's screaming out my name\n\nYou can sleep in your own bed tonight\nI hope for your sake you don't wake up as broken as I am\n\nSleep in your own bed tonight\nI know some day that you will wake up as lonely as I am\n\nYou can sleep in your own bed tonight\nSleep away\nA silent pain\nThat'screaming out my name\n\nYou can sleep in your own bed tonight\nI hope for your sake you don't wake up as broken as I am\n\nSleep in your own bed tonight\nI know some day that you will wake up as lonely as I am\n'Cause fate works both ways\n'Cause fate works both ways\n'Cause fate works both

Various line-up changes followed and during spring \u201994 Burning Heart Records released the EP \u201cKeep Out!\u201d.\u00a0<p>\u00a0<p>The singer Ulf left the band in the beginning of \u201995 and Rodrigo started singing while drumming. This was a temporary arrangement but after hearing Rodrigo sing and watching his double performance live everyone agreed that there was no need to look for a new vocalist.<p>\u00a0<p>Satanic played weekend shows in Sweden during spring and in May \u201995 a split CD with Ten Foot Pole was released on Bad Taste. The summer of \u201995 was spent rehearsing for their upcoming album. \u201cHero of our Time\u201d, which was released in September on Burning Heart and immediately became a big success. To date it has sold more than 60,000 copies. After the release of \u201cHero\u201d the band went on their first tour of Germany together with Millencolin. This opened their eyes to punk scene outside of Scandinavia and during spring the following year they did their first full European tour together with 59 Times the Pain. A Canadian tour followed in June as well as European festivals that summer.<p>\u00a0<p>By the end of \u201996 they recorded \u201c666 Motor Inn\u201d, which was released just in time for the Canadian Sno Jam tour in March \u201997. After the Sno Jam they went out on tour in Europe again, with The Almighty Trigger Happy. Another Euro tour followed in June together with Lag Wagon.\u00a0<p>\u00a0<p>In \u201998 they continued where they left off with a tour of Australia, a full European tour in March and then the work began on a new album. \u201cGoing Nowhere Fast\u201d was recorded in Nov/Dec and before actually being released, Tomek left the band and Magnus\u2019 twin brother, Mathias, took his place.<p>\u00a0<p>\u201cGoing Nowhere Fast\u201d was released in March and the band went across to Canada for the Sno Jam tour once again. The touring continued with lots of festival that summer and another European tour during fall. Again, the band needed to take some time off to regain their strength. There were a lot of things they weren\u2019t exactly happy about and for a while they were even considering starting over with a brand new name. Eventually they decided to continue playing under the Satanic Surfers name, but also to leave Burning Heart for Bad Taste and make severalother changes to ensure more control over their music once again.<p>\u00a0<p>Once all the decisions had been made the band was happier and more focused than they had been in the last five years! Their album \u201dFragments and Fractions\u201d was released in September 2000 and two days after that Satanic started their most successful European tour so far - 32 shows across Europe, 25 completely sold out! In Milan more than 3,500 people showed up! In November they returned to Canada for 10 dates on the East coast and during spring last year they did another hugely successful tour of Europe with sold out shows everywhere before taking a short and much needed break for summer.<p>\u00a0<p>During fall 2001 Rodrigo finally decided that touring as both a drummer and singer was getting too much for him. Within weeks they teamed up with old friend (and Bad Taste employee) Martin Svensson. After rehearsing frequently during winter the band entered Berno Studios in January to record their new album, \u201cUnconsciously Confined\u201d. 13 songs that sees the band continuing the transition started with the \u201cFragments and Fractions\u201d album with more mid-tempo, up beat pop songs together with the fast, melodic punk that has become their trademark. With a sound far surpassing all previous recordings and just over a dozen of the their best songs ever.\u00a0<p>\u00a0<p>Following an April 2002 release, a heavy touring schedule ensued. After three European tours and one across Canada, an otherwise successful year unfortunately ended with a cancelled South American tour and Martin\u2019s decision to quit the band, and return to the Bad Taste office. Rodrigo got back on drums and work on a new album started. However, progress was slow and rehearsals were few and far between. In August Mathias left the band in order to move to Berlin, Germany.<p>\u00a0<p>Now the band needed to find both a drummer and a bass player. In November, Andy (from Intensity) began rehearsing with the band and with his bass playing and his never-ending enthusiasm he proved to be the man for the job. In March 2004 the band got in touch with their friend Samsa (from Adhesive) to see if he was interested. Once he got together with the band in the rehearsal room, it didn\u2019t take long to decide on him being their new drummer. The Satanic line-up was complete for the first time in ages and rehearsals for upcoming shows began.<p>\u00a0<p>After completing three successful shows during May and June, the band did a two-week European tour in August and began writing their 6th album. \u201dTaste The Posion\u201d was recorded in spring 2005 and released in September 2005. The band then took off on tours in Europe, UK, Japan, and Brazil. Taste The Poison was released in all these territories, on different labels, with slightly variated artwork. Magnus left the band after Brazil (March 2006) and was replaced by Dana (from Venerea). They went to Canada for an almost 5 week long tour with Mad Caddies, Loved Ones, Subb, & The Resistance (Grind Tour), and followed up with European festivals during the summer.\u00a0<p>\u00a0<p>After 6 months of radio silence the band met up at a bar and called it quits. The press release was dated February 10th 2007 and since then all members have been active in other bands. Come present day, December 2014, the band has gotten back together with a new - yet secret - drummer and is currently rehearsing for summer shows 2015.

Each song started, as most do, with a question. An event or topic of relationship songwriters Adrian Glynn and Brendan McLeod were moved, enraged or grateful to, and the song is the working out of that process. Rather than skirt the obvious, they decided to embrace the more straightforward challenge of how to close the distance between themselves and the subject. The result is a coherent, ambitious, record. Grounded by the production of John Raham (Dan Mangan, Frazey Ford) and featuring guest appearances by a host of long-term collaborators and tourmates, including Steve Charles, Ali Romanow, Carly Frey, and Ben Elliott, the album is the sound of a collective of friends working ogetehr to help each other close the distance between themselves and others.<p>Many of the tracks on \u201cThe Promise of Strangers\u201d are dedicated to people the band has never met. \u201cNo Words\u201d is a raw outpouring of grief, written the day after Leonard Cohen\u2019s death. \u201cLights Out\u201d is dedicated to Adam Capay, the Indigenous inmate held in solitary confinement in a Thunder Bay jail for four years with the lights on.

Luke&#39;s reasons for choosing that title become clear the moment you dive into the new record -- as they do when he starts to describe its genesis, and the personal and emotional transformation he experienced while making it. &quot;To me,&quot; Luke continues, &quot;this album is about pure expression. Even the way we made the album felt fresh. Rather than us just being a band in a room, playing our guitars with the vocal over the top, which is what we&#39;d always done before, we were really listening to what was going on around us, picking up ideas. The whole thing was much more natural.&quot; &quot;Listen was&quot; kick-started by the track &quot;Around Town,&quot; the bare bones of which Luke laid down in his flat in London. The song&#39;s subject matter is catty, its melody infectious and immediate -- and, compared with the Kooks&#39; previous material, it represents a major shift. &quot;I&#39;d got really heavily into soul music and Afrobeat,&quot; Luke explains. &quot;I remember doing &#39;Around Town&#39; and thing, &#39;Hmm, ok: this is interesting.&#39; Everything, the whole album, crystallised around that one song. And it was only meant to be an experiment; I didn&#39;t think of it as a song for the Kooks at all. All of sudden, it became the direction. I think I was on a bit of a mission, looking back: I&#39;d gone all around the States for about 10 months, working with different people. I&#39;d only ever written by myself or with the other guys before, so it was something I was a bit dubious about to begin with. But I wanted to open up a bit. There was too much negativity in me; I knew I needed to get away, get back to who I am, which is a writer.&quot; Luke&#39;s chief ally in that task was the producer, Inflo, who he credits with helping him dig far deeper than he has before as a songwriter. The most powerful and haunting example of this on &quot;Listen&quot; is the poignant &quot;See Me Now,&quot; on which Luke addresses his father, who died when Luke was a young child. &quot;That was a real case of Inflo pulling a song, an emotion, out of me,&quot; says Luke. &quot;We were talking about it and he just said, &#39;Write a letter to your dad.&#39; A lot of the lyrics, I just wouldn&#39;t have been brave enough to share them before, but he went, &#39;Do it; they&#39;re beautiful.&#39; I found that completely disarming; his whole attitude was, &#39;That&#39;s what music is all about. Let all your defences down.&#39; And that song epitomises that.&quot; Choosing to work with a producer rooted in hip hop and dance music struck some of the people on team Kooks as a risk, Luke admits. &quot;I had heard his music and then his name came up when we were discussing how to approach the new album. I&#39;m not sure many people thought it could work, but I really wanted to meet him. I loved the sound on the records he&#39;d done -- they had this amazing clarity, they were modern but with this rootsy feeling behind them.&quot; Luke stuck to his guns, however, and his hunch proved correct. &quot;The moment I met him, it felt right; although we were, on the surface, from quite different backgrounds, I knew his cousin, Leona Lewis -- we were at school together, we&#39;d done songs together and made that sort of music. So in that sense, it felt almost like going back to something. I had &#39;Around Town&#39; already, and he then pulled all this other stuff out of me. He got where my head was at. We had such a strong connection.&quot; Evidence of that connection can be found throughout &quot;Listen.&quot; Lead single &quot;Down&quot; hares out of the traps, its staccato guitar, call-and-response vocals, punctuating cowbell, falsetto harmonies and self-knowing, defiant lyric (&quot;You can&#39;t break a man who&#39;s already down&quot;) adding up to one giant kiss-off of a song, to an earworm melody that puts down roots in your head and settles in for the long term. &quot;Around Town,&quot; so central and crucial to the album, rides in on a tide of joyful gospel harmonies, as Luke confesses &quot;I need someone to love me when the chips are down&quot;. Stripped-back, loose-limbed, lyrically candid and unblinking, &quot;Around Town&quot; comes across like a musical manifesto, a mission statement from a band who have rediscovered what they loved about making music in the first place, 10 long years ago in Brighton. Yet, as Luke says, the picture wasn&#39;t always so rosy. &quot;The experiences I&#39;d had the year before we made the record were so intense; I&#39;d never felt that low before. I was in a very poisonous relationship, and becoming quite vacuous in my life. Songs such as &#39;Down&#39; and &#39;Around Town&#39; are coming from that place, most of the record is. And things weren&#39;t going well with the band either; we were doing well, but on the inside, things were a mess. We needed to come out of that, and it really was a case of music saving us.&quot; Everyone in the band knew things had to change, Luke says. So out went the old thinking (&quot;The over-thinking,&quot; Luke laughs), and out, too, the old approach to the recording process. &quot;I went completely off chords. We got really obsessed with lines of notes. When you listen to Stones records, the genius of them is the interplay between them. They&#39;ll have a few chords, but it&#39;s much more about those interlayered guitar lines. Flo gave us the confidence to change our approach. It&#39;s difficult in the studio, because the temptation always is to go, &#39;Right, I&#39;m going to do my bit here, and you do that there&#39;. With this record, we didn&#39;t do any rehearsing beforehand. I&#39;d write a song with Flo, or on my own, put it up, and we&#39;d all play over it. So there was a real freedom to the process.&quot; Freedom is certainly the right word for &quot;Are We Electric?,&quot; whose sparse verse, resting on the sweetest of soul-funk grooves, gives way to a chorus of glorious, incandescent joy. One of many surprises on Listen, the track&#39;s warmth and laid-back vibe are replicated on &quot;Forgive & Forget,&quot; a song that is driven by one of those riffs guitarists dream of coming up with, with added call-to-the-dancefloor handclaps, and conjures up a band of friends and n&#39;er-do-wells cruising along a Californian highway, roof down, high on life. On &quot;London,&quot; the band come up with a &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; for the 21st century, as Luke surveys the riot-damaged city, over another monster riff. &quot;Dreams&quot; is similarly minimal, a woozy, just-woke-up ode to the places our heads go when they hit the pillow. Immersion in &quot;Listen&quot; is as liberating for us as the making of it was for the band -- in which case, job done, says Luke. &quot;We were back doing it for the love of it. I&#39;d had the hardest year of my life, so it felt like the shackles were being released. It&#39;s good when you can rise above all the shit that gathers around you. What&#39;s happened with our band has been pretty crazy, internally, for years. But it&#39;s great now. I&#39;ve never felt this comfortable before. It&#39;s like we&#39;ve found peace.&quot; He&#39;s so proud of the album, he says, that his hardest task now is stopping himself banging on about it. &quot;I know that I&#39;m in danger of being too confident about it, because in my head, I just think it&#39;s the best thing in the world; you always do when you come out of making a new record. But I&#39;ve got to keep that in check -- I don&#39;t want to go all Kanye West about it.&quot; Should Luke Pritchard fail in that vow of silence, well, he will deserve our forgiveness. Because do you know what? The Kooks have just made the album of their lives.", "img": null, "title": "The Kooks", "url": "http://portland.eventful.com/events/kooks-/E0-001-103033137-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Roseland Theater", "city": "Portland"}, {"date": "2018-03-08 20:00:00", "description": " with The Devil Wears Prada<br> PAPAROACHCROOKED TEETHPapa Roach have never taken the easy way out and they aren&#39;t going to start now. Over the past two decades the group have established themselves as true trendsetters in heavy music: They&#39;ve been nominated for two Grammys, toured the globe with everyone from Eminem to Marilyn Manson and crafted the n metal anthem Last Resort, which is still in heavy rotation on rock radio seventeen years after its release. However, the group&#39;s ninth full-length Crooked Teeth sees the band returning to their humbleand hungryroots. The album was recorded in a cramped North Hollywood studio with up-and-coming producers Nicholas RAS Furlong and Colin Brittain, who grew up listening to Papa Roach and inspired them to revisit some of the traits that personally endeared the band to them, most notably frontman Jacoby Shaddix&#39;s remarkable rapping technique. We&#39;ve always kind of considered ourselves to be the bastard cousins of everything we&#39;ve every been involved with so we wanted to be true to that and switch things up this time around, Shaddix says. The first time we met up with RAS and Colin, they said that [2000&#39;s] Infest was on constant rotation when they were growing up and they wanted to bring back some of that fire. The connection between the artists and producers was immediate and the first song Papa Roachwhich also features guitarist Jerry Horton, bassist Tobin Esperance and drummer Tony Palermocame up with for Crooked Teeth was My Medication, an instantly catchy banger that sees Shaddix spitting verses in between massive choruses and ambient accents. I really felt like we had a personal connection and the music was just there waiting to be written and once we nailed that song things really clicked and we knew exactly what we had to do Furlong explains. We really followed our instincts and tried something unproven with this record and because of that we ended up with a bold, courageous and more adventurous version of Papa Roach. It was in this studio that old school Papa Roach ways, morphed to create this new school Papa Roach sound.From the instantly infectious nature of the title track to the atmospheric sheen of the ballad Periscope (which features Skylar Grey) and the hip-hop rock mashup Sunrise Trailer Park (which features an impassioned verse from Machine Gun Kelly) Crooked Teeth displays the various sides of Papa Roach and illustrates why they&#39;ve managed to remain relevant while musical trends ebb and flow. We didn&#39;t go into this album with the intention of trying to write radio singles, Horton explains. The collection of songs was really about bookending everything that weve done prior to this album and reintroducing Papa Roach to people who didn&#39;t realize the depth that we have, says Palermo. The whole idea was to take the classic elements of Papa Roach that everyone loved and revamp them into a modern version of the sound through the creative process, adds Furlong. We just wanted to flip everything on its head and see what would happen... and it turned out more amazing than any of us could have expected. The people who have wanted to hear me rap for years are gonna love some of the viciousness on this record, Shaddix explains adding that while he had his own initial reservations about some of the album&#39;s more unorthodox moments such as the the 808 bass drop into a metal breakdown on the album-title track, Crooked Teeth ultimately those adventurous decisions are what make the album such a refreshing change of pace in a rock climate that&#39;s grown increasingly sterile. I&#39;d like to personally thank all of the guys in the band for making this happen because all it takes is one person to give you a shot and this was definitely mine, Furlong adds. I want to be one of the best producers in modern day music so I wanted to work as hard for these guys as they would for themselves because as a producer it was my job to push them to get the kind of quality work everyone has been expecting. Just as Papa Roach felt like they still had something to prove with this record, so did the production team who attempted to bring in elements of music from different genres and parts of the world while still staying true to Papa Roach&#39;s sound. One of the big elements in my production is finding those pockets of rhythm that people associate more with rap or reggae, Furlong explains, a fact that came in especially handy when Shaddix was fine-tuning his freestyle skills. I know rap rhythms because I grew up listening to hip-hop, so I was able to make sure that the delivery was on point and the beat was in the pocket so it didn&#39;t suffer from a lot of the stylistic pitfalls that can happen when you merge rock and rap. Crooked Teeth also sees Shaddix pulling no punches lyrically, as evidenced on intensely personal tracks like Born For Greatness, produced by Jason Evigan (Jason Derulo, Demi Lovato, Kehlani, Madonna), which sees Shaddix getting sentimental about his three children, or American Dreams where the lifelong pacifist begs the listener to ask, have you ever thought war was a sickness? My father is a Vietnam veteran and a lot of those soldiers came back to a country where people weren&#39;t accepting them back into society or aware of the effects that war has on your psyche, Shaddix says of the song. Post-traumatic stress disorder and the disintegration of the American family are things I&#39;ve dealt with personally and I knew other people could relate to. I think that&#39;s what makes this record bold. Nothing was off limits when it came to what was on my mind. Never one to shy away from difficult topics, Papa Roach dug deep with Crooked Teeth and refused to censor themselves when it came to their opinion of the current political landscape and organized religion. For example, on None Of The Above, every ounce of musical intensity on the album is mirrored by Shaddix&#39;s words whether he&#39;s screaming, singing or rhyming. It took me a long time, but eventually I realized that in life we&#39;re all human and we all make mistakes whether you&#39;re the president or the preacher, you know? Shaddix explains when asked about the latter song. It&#39;s an example of how I can get lost in a story line and explore so many different issues in one track and that&#39;s what I love about this record. Just the spark of an idea would instantly ignite and the next thing we knew we had another song that we all loved. In many ways making Crooked Teeth reminded Shaddix of the band&#39;s early days, well before they sold millions of albums and became a household name. When we were in the rehearsal space I wasn&#39;t thinking about who I needed to impress, I was thinking about how much I love making music with the guys in this band, Shaddix admits. It feels honest and it feels pure, adds Esperance. Fittingly, throughout the process, Shaddix gained inspiration from bands like Led Zeppelin and Faith No More, acts who constantly redefined themselves and were never content to rest on the merits of a hit single. This band encompasses some of greatest victories, but it&#39;s also brought out some of my darkest character flaws, Shaddix summarizes, so I have kind of a love-hate relationship with this music, but I can&#39;t stop because I&#39;ve got too much of my life invested in it at this point. We are a purpose-driven band and I&#39;ve got a responsibility to myself and our fans to continue to create.", "img": null, "title": "Papa Roach", "url": "http://neworleans.eventful.com/events/papa-roach-/E0-001-109696276-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "The Joy Theater", "city": "New Orleans"}, {"date": "2018-02-19 19:00:00", "description": "The story of Johnny Cash, music legend.

Last In Line, the band, takes its name from the second Dio album released in1984. Vinny Appice, Jimmy Bain and Vivian Campbell were Ronnie Dio\u2019s co-conspirators and co-writers on the&quot;Holy Diver&quot;, &quot;Last In Line&quot; and &quot;Sacred Heart&quot; albums \u2013 these records have gone on to become part of rockhistory.During that first jam it was apparent that the chemistry of the original band was very much intact, even after a 27year hiatus. The excitement generated by that rediscovery led to a second session, where this time they called inacclaimed vocalist Andrew Freeman. Hearing Andrew\u2019s interpretations of the original Dio songs was a revelationand the inspiration to move forward as a band. Over the ensuing years a handful of local LA shows led to a handfulof overseas shows in the U.K. and Japan, and eventually to an offer from Frontiers to record a new album of originalmaterial.During the course of 2014 the band wrote and recorded 12 new songs and chose longtime friend Jeff Pilson asproducer. Jeff very much captured the organic crunch of the band and the very best in Andrew\u2019s voice and delivery.Last In Line\u2019s debut album, \u201cHeavy Crown\u201d was released in February 2016, hitting number 1 on the Billboard Heat-Seekers Chart, with the singles \u201cDevil In Me\u201d and \u201cStarmaker\u201d leading the charge.

For California alt-pop band THE MOWGLI&#39;S that moment is two-fold on their superb third album &quot;Where&#39;d Your Weekend Go?,&quot; due fall 2016. They not only get to share their songwriting growth with fans who have followed the band since they formed in 2010, the band got to experience it themselves.Ask singers and principal songwriters KATIE EARL, JOSH HOGAN and COLIN DIEDEN the secret to the band&#39;s growth on this new album and they will all say it came from within. &quot;Involving the whole band in the writing process was a hugely important factor in this new record. When everyone&#39;s there you just have more brains, more minds,&quot; HOGAN says. EARL echoes this: &quot;A lot of our songs start with one or two people&#39;s ideas and the band puts their mark on them later. This time we spent a great deal of time in the room together as the six of us, building many songs from the ground up.&quot;The results of incorporating band members whose tastes run from &quot;musical theater to black metal to pop&quot; according to HOGAN, are an incredibly diverse collection of songs that run like a musical time machine through the best of the past four decades of music.From the jangly folk/pop of the Sixties-infused &quot;Arms & Legs,&quot;and the groovy Seventies feel of &quot;Monster&quot; to the 80&#39;s inspired &quot;Bad Thing&quot; and anthemic &quot;Spiderweb&quot; this latest collection is a testament to songwriting.One recent song released from the LP, &quot;Spacin Out&quot; is one of the first tracks that came together from jamming in the studio. &quot;&#39;Spacin Out&#39; has a kind of jazzy feel, but it&#39;s very Mowgli&#39;s, &quot;says HOGAN. &quot;In the bridge we cut to a seven/eight time signature -- it&#39;s little things like that come from the fact we have some really amazing musicians in our band.&quot; In addition to Dieden, Earl and Hogan, the band is rounded out by MATTHEW DI PANNI (bass), DAVID APPELBAUM (keys) and ANDY WARREN (drums).The band has been previewing some of the new songs on recent tour dates with great success. &quot;&#39;Monster,&#39; it&#39;s just crazy the reaction we&#39;ve been getting from audiences,&quot; DIEDEN says. &quot;It&#39;s an immediately familiar-sounding song.&quot; They&#39;re also playing the album&#39;s first released track, &quot;Freakin&#39; Me Out,&quot; a thoroughly engaging and winning blend of summer-like pop, R&B and soul that is one of the band&#39;s favorite songs since their first LP&#39;s debut single &quot;San Francisco.&quot;HOGAN, EARL and DIEDEN freely admit that the success of &quot;San Francisco,&quot; which led to TV appearances on The Tonight Show, Conan and Jimmy Kimmel, sold-out tours and, arguably most excitedly, a prominent role in the San Francisco Giants&#39; World Series title in 2012 (the team played it regularly on their way to the championship) had influence on the sophomore record, Kids in Love.Making that second LP, they felt rushed and pressured by often conflicting outside opinions. But as the clich goes, &quot;That which does not kill you....&quot; HOGAN credits that experience with motivating the band to take a stand against external forces on this collection. &quot;With this record we were very clear about doing it ourselves and we just said, &#39;Give us a little time and we&#39;ll write you a sick record,&#39;&quot;They backed it up, showing growth, not only musically, but lyrically as well. &quot;These songs are about really digging deeper into personal issues because there are only so many times you can sing about loving each other. It&#39;s not that we have moved past that message necessarily, it&#39;s that we want to explore other concepts,&quot; HOGAN says. &quot;There&#39;s one song on the record, &#39;Last Forever,&#39; that was meant for the second album but we ended up reworking it a lot. It&#39;s a song I was writing going through a breakup and life changes, with a line in the song that says, &#39;If we lose it altogether, maybe love will last forever.&#39; That, to me, is the opposite of what the Mowgli&#39;s would normally say. But I hope people can connect with that sentiment.&quot;Helping them channel all these changes into the growth on the new album is producer Mike Green (Pierce The Veil, All Time Low, The Wanted), who the band was so confident they wanted to work with that they revised their whole recording schedule to accommodate his availability.To EARL, it was absolutely the right call. &quot;We&#39;re a lot of really big personalities, a lot of energy and Mike has this really calming, relaxed vibe that&#39;s much different from any of the rest of ours. And he works so fast that nothing gets lost or overthought,&quot; she says. &quot;It just felt like the right fit. We had never worked with him before, so we did a trial run, and just clicked.&quot;DIEDEN agrees. &quot;Mike has a really good sense of contemporary popular music but I think he&#39;s very aware of how to make ideas sound different and unique. He also understands what people want to hear right now, which is a great balancing act.&quot; The band also collaborated with U.K. producer Rob Ellmore on &quot;Automatic&quot; and &quot;Bad Thing,&quot; the LP&#39;s first radio single. &quot;&#39;Bad Thing&#39;&#39; says Dieden, &quot;is a song about the kind of person who feels so good they&#39;re dangerous. The kind of person you want to run away from and pull closer to you simultaneously. The song also makes ya wanna shake your butt with your pals.&quot;All of these elements -- Green, the band&#39;s renewed independence and collaborative process -- have weaved together seamlessly to make The Mowgli&#39;s third record a career album, that moment where the band steps to the next level as artists. HOGAN and EARL hear it proudly as they listen to the album all the way through.&quot;It&#39;s been really cool to learn and experience everything we have and now, us as people, we&#39;re very close and I think we&#39;re just at our best,&quot; HOGAN says.&quot;This record is the truest representation of who we are, not just as individuals, but as a band,&quot; EARL says. It&#39;s the sound of collaboration, it&#39;s the sound of listening to and working with each other in ways that we&#39;ve never done before. I&#39;m really, really proud of every moment. Everybody shines more than they&#39;ve ever shone. To me, it feels like a rebirth for us.&quot;", "img": null, "title": "The Mowgli's", "url": "http://seattle.eventful.com/events/mowglis-/E0-001-109240085-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "The Crocodile", "city": "Seattle"}], "description": "The Starting Line is an American pop punk band that was formed in 1999 in Churchville, Pennsylvania. The band consists of Kenny Vasoli (vocals, bass), Matt Watts (guitar), Mike Golla (guitar), Brian Schmutz (keyboards, vocals) and Tom Gryskiewicz (drums). Having four studio albums under their belt, the group are best known for their 2007 rock radio hit \"Island\" as well as their popular 2002 single \"The Best of Me\". In 2008, the band began a hiatus, which ended several months later but the group has only toured intermittently since then.\n\nVasoli has lately been focusing on his side project, known as Person L. Tom has been recording with his new band, Cheap Seats, with Matt as their manager. Mike also has a side project, called The Traded Series. The origins of the group that would become The Starting Line go back to 1999, via an AOL instant message from Churchville, Pennsylvania guitarist Matt Watts to vocalist/bassist Kenny Vasoli. It asked if the then fourteen-year-old Vasoli, who was at that time in a band called Smash Adams, was interested in \"Jamming and shit\", as the message title read.\n\nOnly a few weeks later, Vasoli found himself rehearsing with his future bandmates Watts, guitarist Mike Golla and drummer Tom Gryskewicz. Soon, the band started touring under the name Sunday Drive, selling out home-made merchandise and a self-recorded demo cassette that the guys titled 'Four Songs'. Their first official release was a three-way split with The Jimmy Tuesday Band and The Commercials contributing three songs each, the work released on KickStart Audio in 2000.\n\nSunday Drive was soon approached by We the People Records and asked to produce a recording session (the infamous We the People Records Sessions). Set for a release in December 2000, the twelve songs were initially planned to become the band's debut full-length With Hopes of Starting Over on We the People Records, but they ended up serving only as demos for tracks on future releases, as the band signed with Drive-Thru Records in April 2001. On Drive-Thru, they soon released their debut EP With Hopes of Starting Over. Yet, as the name Sunday Drive was already taken by a Christian rock band, they went on as The Starting Line.\n\nOn July 16, 2002, almost exactly one year after the release of their EP, the full-length Say It Like You Mean It followed. The songs ranged from energetic and fast-paced to melancholy and calm, dealing with performing on stage (\"Given the Chance\"), feeling homesick (\"Left Coast Envy\") and getting even with Vasoli's ex-girlfriend Karina (\"Up & Go\", \"Hello Houston\", among others). The hit single \"The Best of Me\" and its two music videos, as well as the second single \"Leaving\", received heavy radio and TV airplay, securing The Starting Line a spot on the Warped Tour.\n\nDue to their desire to put out new material, the band decided to release an all-unplugged EP, recorded in three sessions over the following year. The first three songs (recorded in The Prize Fight's Bob Jones' bedroom in August 2002), the second session (recorded in Vasoli's basement in March 2003) and the last track (recorded on the band's touring bus in April 2003) became The Make Yourself at Home EP, released on November 25, 2003. The CD and the DVD version issued simultaneously, featuring an acoustic set performed live at Skate & Surf 2003 in Asbury Park, New Jersey, would be their last releases put out solely on Drive-Thru Records, as The Starting Line was signed by Geffen Records soon afterwards.\n\nTheir major label debut, Based on a True Story, came out in May 2005. Lyrically, the band dissociated themselves from the post-relationship formula that was predominant on their previous records. On this album, a lot of the songs (e.g. \"Inspired By the $\", \"Autography\" and \"The B-List\") were explicitly inspired by the band's disdain for their record label Geffen and its executives. The album was far more successful than the band's 2002 effort and sold 42,000 copies within its first week, as opposed to its predecessor's 11,000. The release was followed by the semi-headlining Nintendo Fusion Tour with Fall Out Boy, kicking off in September 2005. A few dates into the tour, The Starting Line were \u2014 at their request \u2014 released from their record deal with Geffen, and became free agents. In early January 2006, their signing with Virgin Records was announced.\n\nOn March 5, 2008 the band announced in an e-mail and on Absolutepunk.net they would be going on a break in order for Ken and Brian to explore Person L, Matt and Tom to explore The Seventy Six, and Mike to spend time with his two daughters and explore The Traded Series. The band had been playing with the idea of coming back in 2011, but in a chat with absolutepunk.net, Kenny Vasoli said, \"\"it's looking good, may even be earlier. I hung with Matt and Tom the other day, we all are still in love with one another.\n\nOn November 10, 2009, The Starting Line released their first-ever live concert CD, film and documentary DVD titled \"Somebody's Gonna Miss Us\" via Image Entertainment on a 2-disc set. Through intimate and honest interviews with the band, friends and family fans will get a glimpse into the inner workings of the group and a career that spanned nearly a decade, five releases, and thousands of shows. \n\nOn December 29, 2009, The Starting Line had a reunion concert at the Theater of Living Arts. Starting Line guitarist Matt Watts stated on the website AbsolutePunk that \"this doesn't mean that TSL are back together....It simply means that we're taking a break from our break, and wanted to play a fun show in Philadelphia and continue to focus on our lives outside of TSL\"\n\nThe Starting Line added a second holiday show on December 30, 2009 in Philadelphia at the Trocadero Theater. This was added due to the fact that the first holiday show scheduled for December 29, 2009 sold out in a little over an hour and the band would like to give their local fans a better chance to see them. Towards the end of their set, Kenny Vasoli announced the band's reunion. However, the group has only toured intermittently since then.\n\nMain Website: http://www.startinglinerock.com\nMySpace: http://www.myspace.com/thestartingline <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Starting+Line\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

All rights belong to the artists."}, "description": null}], "events": null, "description": "Stephen Arthur Stills is an American guitarist and singer-songwriter best known for his work with the Buffalo Springfield, Crosby, Stills & Nash and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.\n\nStephen Stills was born in Dallas, Texas on January 3, 1945 to a military family. Moving around as a child, he developed an interest in blues and folk music. He was also influenced by Latin music after spending his teenage years in Costa Rica and the Panama Canal Zone, where he graduated from high school.\n\nStills dropped out of the University of Florida to pursue a music career in the early 1960s. He played in a series of unsuccessful bands including the Continentals, which featured future The Eagles guitarist Don Felder. Stills eventually ended up in a nine-member vocal harmony group, the house act at the famous Cafe Au Go Go in NYC, called the Au Go Go Singers (Rick Geiger, Roy Michaels, Michael Scott, Jean Gurney, Kathy King, Nels Gustafson, Bob Harmelink, Richie Furay & Stills) where and when he met Richie Furay. This group also did some touring in the Catskills, and in the South, released one album in 1964, then broke up in 1965. Afterwards, Stills, along with four other former members of the Au Go Go Singers: Geiger, Michaels, Gurney & Scott, formed The Company, a folk/rock group. Immediately prior to performing in the Au Go Go Singers, Stills could be seen singing solo in Gerde's Folk City, a well-known coffee house in Greenwich Village. The Company embarked on a 6-week tour of Canada where Stills met a young guitarist named Neil Young. On the VH1 CSNY Legends special, Stills would say that at that time, Young was doing what he always wanted to do, \"play folk music in a rock band.\" The Company broke up in New York within four months, opening up the way for Geiger to join a light opera company in Los Angeles; Michaels to link up with Jimi Hendrix, Gurney to go on to college while doing TV commercials, and Scott to tour with a retro-Highwaymen. Stills did session work and went to various auditions (including an unsuccessful one for The Monkees). In 1966 he convinced a reluctant former Au Go Go Singers, Richie Furay, then living in Massachusetts, to move with him to California.\n\nSolo years\n\nIn the wake of CSNY's success, all four members recorded solo albums. In 1970, Stills released his self-titled debut, which featured guests Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, \"Mama\" Cass Elliot, and Ringo Starr (credited only as \"Richie\") as well as contributions from various members of the CSNY band. It provided Stills with the hit single \"Love The One You're With\" as well as the concert favorite \"Black Queen.\" Stills followed this with Stephen Stills 2, which featured \"Change Partners.\" Nash saw this song as a metaphor for the many relationships in CSNY, while Stills viewed the band as something much less bland and repetitive.\nThe next year, Stills teamed up with ex-Byrd Chris Hillman and several CSNY sidemen to form the band Manassas. During a Manassas tour in France, Stills met and married French singer-songwriter Veronique Sanson. Then he switched to Columbia Records, where he recorded two albums: Stills in 1975 and the punningly titled Illegal Stills in 1976. The former record found Stills in an uncharacteristically joyful mood; his marriage was going great, his son Chris had just been born, and he was happy living in Colorado. \"To Mama From Christopher and the Old Man\" was an exceptionally optimistic view of his new family.\nIn 1976, Stills attempted a reunion with Neil Young. At one point, Long May You Run was slated to be a CSNY record, but when Crosby and Nash left to fufill recording and touring obligations, according to both David and Graham the other pair wiped their vocals from the recordings, as Stills and Young decided to go on without their erstwhile partners as The Stills-Young Band. However, Young would leave midway through the resulting tour due to an apparent throat infection. Stills was contractually bound to finish the tour, which he did, but upon returning home, his wife announced she wanted a divorce and wished to move back to France. Stills reunited with Crosby and Nash shortly afterwards, thanks to the efforts of Nash's future wife Susan, who got Nash to forgive Stills for wiping the Crosby and Nash vocals from Long May You Run. This led to the semi-permanent CSN reunion of 1977, which has persisted even though all three have released solo records since then.\nIn 1997, Stills became the first person to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice in the same night for his work with CSN and the Buffalo Springfield.\n2005 saw Stills release 'Man Alive'; his first solo offering in 14 years. Although not troubling the chart compilers, the record was critically well received and is regarded by many fans as his best since the mid seventies.\n\nStills was the inspiring influence for Ray LaMontagne who, after hearing one of his songs, decided to quit his job and focus on music. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Stephen+Stills\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Recording what would become the critically acclaimed Salvation in Lights (2007), a resurrected Mike eagerly anticipated the future. But with two ruptured discs, back surgery and the death of his beloved manager Rose McGathy all within a few weeks of the record&#39;s release, a rolling fog settled in. And with it, denial.Nevertheless, Mike&#39;s career was picking up steam. He won an Americana Music Award for New/Emerging Artist in 2008, followed by a Dove Award in 2010. His live performances at Bonnaroo, SxSW, Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival, and others-were drawing rave reviews. Revered artists like Rodney Crowell, Buddy Miller, Patty Griffin, and Marty Stuart were struck by his incomparable voice, and Mike opened shows for Patti LaBelle, Mavis Staples, Blind Boys of Alabama, Ricky Skaggs and Bruce Hornsby.By 2010, having released the award winning SHOUT! Live followed by an EP for Nashville flood relief efforts, Mike launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund his next record, an independent release. His fans generously funded the project.Serious invitations kept coming: first, to the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame&#39;s 16th Annual American Music Masters concert honoring Aretha Franklin, then TEDx Nashville, and then to the inaugural Austin City Limits Hall of Fame with Double Trouble.Mike&#39;s spirited, soul-gospel fusion had found an enthusiastic audience, but denial has a way of biting back. Compared to his former life, he thought he was fine, but truth be told, Mike had become addicted to pain medication. The new album would have to take a back seat to a gut-check, life-changing recovery. Mike went to rehab and finally began excavating the root causes of his addiction with the help of support groups at AA and NA. An isolator by nature, he struggled laying all his burdens on the table to complete strangers, but gained encouragement through the stories of others. Each honest step led to fertile, hopeful ground.What eventually emerged from that fertile ground is Shine For All The People, the evolution of true sobriety, of finding a new identity as a servant, first as a man but also as an artist. &quot;I&#39;d been working on the record before my recovery, and then there was a pretty huge delay,&quot; explains Mike, who signed with Compass Records. &quot;I had to back up, take time to grab the ground, to re-acclimate, to learn how to live now, truly sober for the first time since I was a kid.&quot;This new normal included getting back to the process of creating new music, but there was a distinctive trajectory shift in Mike. &quot;So many avenues of music flow through me, 100s of years of music, the music that I grew up with-from Blues, Rock, R&B and gospel-there had always been this pressure to try to force it into a box that would sell somehow. It&#39;s crazy and overwhelming at times, the weight of trying to meet expectations and make a living, but this time, that all fell away. I know now that this gift only exists to encourage people in their struggles, and if there&#39;s any power in it, it&#39;s not from me.&quot;Released in September 2014, Shine For All The People pushes beyond Salvation in Lights in that it reveals hope not in any glory to come, but in the failures and suffering of the present. &quot;My music has always been first and foremost for the downtrodden, the wayward...people who&#39;ve had to go up the rough side of the mountain. Even when it&#39;s upbeat and inspiring, there&#39;s always been an element of pain, because truth be told, we&#39;re all flawed. Not everybody knows it, but we all are.&quot;From the opening Cuban/St. Louis blues horns of &quot;River Jordan,&quot; originally written and performed by Blind Willie McTell, to the divine salvation of J.B. Lenoir&#39;s &quot;Jonah & the Whale,&quot; to the determined stance of the Rev. C.J. Johnson&#39;s &quot;Something Keeps on Telling Me,&quot; a chorus/mantra that Mike fleshed out into a song in the months after rehabone listen, and it&#39;s clear there&#39;s something mystical in the waters here.&quot;When I first heard the Rev. C.J. Johnson&#39;s version, I could feel the air in that church get still, no music, only the sound of feet on the floor and hands in the air,&quot; Mike says. &quot;I got such strength from it, I knew I wanted to add part of my story. With his words as the chorus, and with Brigitte DeMeyer helping me out, the song serves as a compass for anyone who has lost their way.&quot;Mary Gauthier&#39;s soul-stirring &quot;Mercy Now,&quot; one of the first songs Mike chose for the record, is clearly foundational to the whole. &quot;The song just mystically appeared before me a few months before my Dad was diagnosed with lung cancer,&quot; he says. &quot;Not only did it play a major role in just helping me deal with the year that followed, including his death, but brought comfort to my entire family.&quot;Like other choice cuts on Shine For All The People, the songs simply arrived at the appointed time, Mike says. &quot;There was a time when I carried all the songwriting on my shoulders, but then the ego gets in the way of what it should be. These days, I don&#39;t have to write everything. I just open the door and these songs show up...songs I need to hear in my struggle, songs I know people need to hear in theirs.&quot;Whether rearranging songs of centuries past or infusing new lyrical life to half-songs, it becomes clear that Mike&#39;s vocal gift is simply the surface of a very deep well. Full-tilt originals include &quot;Real Fine Day,&quot; a poetic account of the birth of Christian Blue Sky Farris that features some killer Kenny Vaughn guitar hooks-&quot;easily one of the top three days of my life, that day,&quot; Mike says, and &quot;Power of Love,&quot; an unforgettable, high-energy soul groove and already an audience favorite.Shine For All the People, the 2015 Grammy Award winner for Best Roots Gospel album, bears witness to the determination of putting one foot in front of the other and to the power of music to get you there. &quot;I&#39;ve discovered that falling is a divine thing,&quot; Mike adds. &quot;It&#39;s part and parcel of being human. The important thing is to keep the faith and keep moving on and on. Daring to be courageous enough to share our deepest burdens with each other is the greatest gift we can give.&quot;DiscographyGoodnight Sun (2002) IndependentSalvation In Lights (2007) INO/Columbia RecordsSHOUT!

This lineup will mix up friends from Olympia&#39;s International Pop Underground with pals and originators of Los Angeles punk. \u2022 Lois Maffeo - Rare Los Angeles appearance by the beloved Olympia, WA-based K Records artist who has played solo but also been part of The Union Themes, Dub Narcotic Sound System, and Courtney Love (the band). \u2022 Selector Dub Narcotic - The latest project from Calvin Johnson of Beat Happening, Go Team, Halo Benders, Dub Narcotic Sound System, Hive Dwellers, and K Records fame is a bona-fide portable party machine. \u2022 Special set by PHAG, featuring first-wave Los Angeles punk lifers, artists, activists, and ambassadors Phranc and Alice Bag doing their updated and politically charged version of the Smothers Brothers&#39; witty banter and catchy folk combo for the Trump Era.\u2022 Mike Watt & The Missingmen - The universally beloved bass champ from Minutemen, fIREHOSE, DOS, and other L.A. punk bands cranks and tweaks old and new faves with his top-shelf combo of Tom Watson (Red Krayola, Slovenly) and Raul Morales (KIller Dreamer, FYP). \u2022 In-between jams courtesy of DJ Baby Tender Love a.k.a. Michelle from Jabberjaw playing hits from 3711 Pico Blvd., the spiritual bridge between Oly&#39;s Capitol Theater and Chinatown&#39;s old Hong Kong Cafe. That&#39;s a lot of great music for 12 lousy bucks (and maybe some raffle tickets). SCHEDULE Subject to change but just to give you an idea of how the day will go: 2:00 Doors2:30-3:00 Lois3:15-4:00 Selector Dub Narcotic4:15-4:45 Alice Bag and Phranc a.k.a.

But for everyone.&quot;\u00a0 Joe Hurley recently told the HUFFINGTON POST\u00a0 &quot; People of all ethnicities can see themselves in the melodies, the lyrics, of the Irish. By embracing the Irish Songbook, were all pretty much holding hands across the water. Sharing the human condition. It&#39;s a joyful event, cracking songs from Thin Lizzy, Van, to old ballads my mother sang for me as a child. Anyone coming to the Revue for the first time will hear wonderful Irish songs that they know, along with obscure ones. And they&#39;re not going to hear this anywhere else thanks to the cross-cultural mix of all the artists. A Syrian folk singer, Tristame, doing &#39;Dirty Old Town?\u2019 Perfect. The artists are not all of Irish descent & that&#39;s the point. Ethnically across the board, as culturally diverse as it gets.

The group blends bluegrass, old time, country, folk, blues, jazz, and ragtime music. The group's members are guitarist Pete Bernhard, upright bassist Lucia Turino, and guitarist and tenor banjo player Cooper McBean.\n\n\u201cThe rhythm is what our band is about.\" Says Pete Bernhard: Guitarist, Front Man. The Devil Makes Three are quite possibly the best band that you have never heard of. They have been constantly on tour, selling out dates across the country and in their neck of the woods on the West Coast drawing near capacity crowds nightly. This is all word of mouth. Over the years, the Devil Makes Three have garnered fans the old school way, playing a city, making friends, conquering fans and moving on.\n\nLaced with elements of ragtime, blues, country, folk and rockabilly, the critically praised, drummer-less trio - consisting of Vermont native, guitarist/front man Pete Bernhard, stand-up bassist Lucia Turino and guitarist Cooper McBean, also of rural Vermont - brings forth a genuine approach to acoustic music.  The sound is deeply steeped in rhythm and alive with three part harmonies, while keeping a slightly punk aesthetic to their music and especially their live shows.\n\nNote: the following songs belong to a different band with the same name, a small local metal band from Northern Ireland:\n\nA Lesson Unlearnt\nDead\nFeed the Greed\nHeaven Descent <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Devil+Makes+Three\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A cover of Animal Collective&#39;s &quot;Bees,&quot; which can still be viewed on YouTube was the final song in an entire evening of Animal Collective songs Seasons had put together with some friends at the Echo (in LA) on Oct. 29, 2012. As Moody wails and Seasons gently harmonizes behind her over twinkling synths and processed guitar, you can sense the audience holding their breath as the band was born. The songs of Haunted Summer are dreamy and hypnotic, rich with orchestral strings and sultry electronic textures. With their previous EP, Something in the Water, the group crafted a captivating, ethereal musical journey through a nostalgic world of young love and long-forgotten memories. Consisting of husband-and-wife Bridgette Moody and John Seasons, who share songwriting duties in a true collaboration, the Highland Park duo have shared the stage and toured with groups and performers including Taken By Trees, Islands, Deafheaven, The Polyphonic Spree, Coeur De Pirate, Olafur Arnalds, Carla Morrison, Meiko, Basia Bulat, Geographer, David J of Bauhaus and many more. Their new full-length, Spirit Guides, was written on the road as well as recorded in several studios including Rancho de la Luna in Joshua Tree, Jim Henson Studios in Hollywood, Comp-ny LA, and studios owned by Ninkasi Brewing in Eugene, Oregon. It features an array of talented musicians, including (but not limited to!) Dave Catching from Eagles of Death Metal and Chris Goss from Masters of Reality (both of whom are on the title track). Having completed multiple headlining tours across the country and a new 45 day tour to start 2018 off, Haunted Summer is poised to bring their psychedelic sound to the world.Haunted Summer crafts languid pop music, adorned with orchestral strings and electronic textures that recall Soft Bulletin-era Flaming Lips.-Candice Aman (KXSC Radio) The five tracks on the Something in The Water reinforce the group&#39;s ghostly vibes, with Moody&#39;s ethereal vocals blending seamlessly with spaced-out and hazy orchestral dream-pop, allowing the music to take control of your headspace like a ray of light seeping in through the cracks of a long forgotten and rundown gothic mansion. -The Portland Mercury (CT)The pairs blend of experimental guitar riffs, ethereal orchestral features, and Moodys trance-like vocalsplus a ton of oddball electronic sounds that add even more texturecreates a sound that sticks with you. -The Seattle Weekly (Azaria Podplesky)Bridgette Eliza Moody and John Seasons are the groups mainstays, but they have smartly added other musicians to the mix, taking their music to a bolder, higher level. The use of clarinet especially enhances and grounds their sound as Moody&#39;s augmented vocals and Seasons languid guitar licks add ethereal layers. -The Inlander (Laura Johnson) Haunted Summer features Bridgette Moody and John Seasons, who share songwriting and performing duties in a true collaboration. The result is a very pretty, psychedelic sound with ethereal vocals from Bridgette, who comes into her own as a lead vocalist. -Julia Stoller(The Boston Music Survival Guide)The music definitely fulfills the definition of dream pop. The lyrical content relies heavily on longing for and reveling in young love.This is a young band with a high ceiling, I would not be surprised if these songs break out nationally. The title track ends with &quot;No one will love you when you are loved&quot; however this band has love to spare, and I except big things coming their way. -Scott Schultz (LA Record)Its like falling asleep in a bathtub of cough syrup. - Wayne Jessup(The Owl Mag)&quot;Just two days after the release of their eerily-named EP, Something In The Water, dream pop duo, Haunted Summer, will make the room echo and whirl to the tune of their supernatural anthems, already quite a hit amongst fellow Angelenos&quot; -Cynthia Orgel (Santa Cruz&#39;s GoodTimes Weekly)Together, the Highland Park coed duo makes digi-folk pop thats as enticing as it is spooky. Like an echo in a cave, Moodys voice carries an eerie yet seductive vibe over soothing strums or gentle beats. This is the sound of dew forming on a chilly morning-DanFrazier (Free Bike Valet blog)Over the first couple months as Haunted Summer, Seasons and Moody wrote a flurry of songs, recording at home and then enlisting friends to play the music live, first around LA and then on tour in support of Polyphonic Spree, Islands and Taken By Trees. - Eric Swedlund (TucsonWeekly)Haunted Summer, lives up to its name with an even more enchanting series of dream-pop shimmers, as Bridgette Eliza Moody&#39;s vocals trail off languidly in the jet stream of husband John Seasons&#39; majestic emissions. -Falling James (LA Weekly)Their brand of dream pop feels timeless, with just the right amount of youthful nostalgia to woo your ears into submission. Moodys smooth, light as air vocals captivate like a siren of the sea, while the arrangements are lush and seductive, but never pushy. Its a delightful combination that has the power to fill any lazy summer day with an extra bit of magic. -Jacqueline Caruso (The Deli Magazine LA)Theres no question that whatever is haunting Moody and Seasons is steering the duo toward a beautiful place. -Kevin Bronson (Buzzbands LA)Windswept vocals, sultry strings and spacey guitar blend together beautifully. The whole thing is mysterious and engrossing enough that it gets under your skin and stirs your own private nostalgia. -Billy Gil (Amoeba Blog)Haunted Summer features Bridgette Moody and John Seasons, who share songwriting and performing duties in a true collaboration. The result is a very pretty, psychedelic sound with ethereal vocals from Bridgette, who comes into her own as a lead vocalist. -Julia Stoller (The Boston Music Survival Guide)Haunted Summer is a band whose music eerily fits their name perfectly. Angelic, other-worldly vocals lead the way and give life to a beautiful dream-pop inspired sound. -Glen Casebeer (Northwest Music Scene)Haunted Summer is John Seasons & Bridgette Moody. Together they are heading in directions they couldnt pursue in their former bands, making eerie psychedelic orchestral pop.-Kathryn Pinto (Radio Free Silver Lake)Haunted Summer&#39;s &quot;Something in the Water&quot;, is full of hazy chamber-psych that unfolds in slo-mo, providing plenty of room for Bridgette&#39;s nostalgic croon. It&#39;s a likeable sound, as evidenced by the inordinate number of press clippings the band has posted to its Tumblr. -The Portland Mercury (Ben Salmon)The sexy, head trip music of Bridgette Moody and John Seasons seems to take shape somewhere in the space between your ears. They feed you all their hypnotic sounds and leave your brain and senses to figure it out. -Brad Roberts (Feed Your Head Blog)Their brand of synth-y mid-tempo dream pop along with Moodys ethereal vocals weave through whimsical melodies with twinkly resonance. -Melody Stone (Capital Public Radio)On Something in the Water, gentle, hazy vocals take the forefront, gliding along on clouds of delicate synth and simple, nostalgic melodies. Just when the whole thing is about to float off untethered into the ether, though, come gentle rolls of surf guitar and sudden sweeps of strings that keep things grounded in a wall of intricately-woven electronic sounds. Despite its gentle ease, theres still something kind of eery about the way the harmonies seem to linger in the air for a moment, even after a song ends. - Kaitie Todd (Willamette Weekly)Haunted Summer consists of Bridgette Eliza Moody and John Seasons, reigning from the Los Angeles area. The group crafts ethereal, dream pop that comes off haunting live -Shane Jackson (DTLV MUSIC)Haunted Summer play mostly mid-tempo, textual music that is heavy on the guitar effects and synthesized sounds. Moodys voice is a powerful, emotive tool that plays soft, sweet contrast to the hints of darkness below. It makes for an eerie, soft-at-the-edges psychedelia. - Joshua Tehee (The Fresno Bee)", "img": null, "title": "Haunted Summer", "url": "http://eventful.com/flagstaff/events/haunted-summer-/E0-001-110505938-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "The Green Room", "city": "Flagstaff"}], "description": "There are two artists with the name Meiko:\n1) an American singer/songwriter\n2) the first Japanese-language Vocaloid\n\n1) Meiko (pronounced MEE-ko) (born February 25, 1982), is an American singer/ songwriter, born and raised in Roberta, Georgia and currently residing in Los Angeles, California. She independently released a self-titled album on September 1, 2007. All of the tracks from the LP have been featured in major network TV shows. Her second full-length album, entitled The Bright Side, was released through Fantasy Records on May 15, 2012.\n\nRaised by her father in the small town of Roberta, Georgia, Meiko first stepped in front of an audience at the age of eight, singing \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d for parishioners of a Southern Baptist church. At eighteen, Meiko left her hometown to showcase her talents to a wider audience. After a brief stop in Miami, she set down in Los Angeles and began her career in earnest, playing venues all over Southern California and writing at a prolific pace. She performed (and bartended) at Hollywood's Hotel Caf\u00e9 (where she still performs regularly).\n\nMeiko is one-quarter Japanese, on her maternal grandmother's side; in an attempt to get in touch with their Japanese heritage, she and her sister, designer Kelly Nishimoto, adopted the nicknames Meiko and Keiko.\n\n2) The name of the first Japanese-language Vocaloid released by Crypton Future Media, released in 2004. Vocaloid is a singing synthesizer application software developed by the Yamaha Corporation that enables users to synthesize singing by just typing in lyrics and melody. Numbered Crypton Vocaloid 00, Meiko was the first female Vocaloid, counterpart to Kaito.  Her voice is based on a Japanese female singer Haig\u014d Meiko (\u62dd\u90f7 \u30e1\u30a4\u30b3). Her voice is noted to be steady, straightforward, and suitable for any musical genre. She is fit to sing anything from pop, rock, jazz, R&B to children's songs. Since Vocaloid has some functions that Vocaloid 2 do not have, such as Resonance. Different users can utilize the voicebanks offered very differently and she can produce a wide range of different results from the same few voicebanks.\n\nOn July 24, 2003, an CCCD album \"HISTORY OF LOGIC SYSTEM\", which included a song using Japanese vocaloids commercially for the first time, was released. It was a duet song of \"Ano Subarashii Ai wo Mou Ichido (That Wonderful Love Once More)\" and it was covered by prototype version of Meiko and Kaito before their release. Meiko has been confirmed to have an Append on the way, but no data has been released on its progress. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Meiko\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The four piece released EPs and singles before signing up with German record label Nuclear Blast and releasing a successful self-titled debut album Blues Pills. The band released their second album Lady in Gold in August 2016.\n\nHistory: Formation and EPs\nIn 2011, half-brothers Zack Anderson (bass) and Cory Berry (drums), formerly of Radio Moscow, were in Iowa and met singer Elin Larsson, who was staying in California. Together they recorded two demo tracks and published them on YouTube, after which label \"Crusher Records\" offered them a deal. The band toured to Spain and France, where they met 16-year-old guitarist Dorian Sorriaux, whom they invited to \u00d6rebro and made a member of the band. The name of the band came from their friend, Jens Heide, who had a music blog called BluesPillz with obscure 60s and 70s underground music.\n\nIn May 2012 they released an EP called \"Bliss\", followed by the \"Black Smoke\" single in July. The band toured extensively during 2013 with appearances in Berlin's \"Desertfest\" in April, in Bad K\u00f6tzting's \"Void Fest\" and Geel's \"Yellowstock Festival\" in August, in Bonn's \"Crossroads Festival\" in October and Melbourne's \"Cherry Rock Festival\" in November 2013.\n\nIn July 2013, Blues Pills signed a contract with the \"Nuclear Blast\" label and released their \"Devil Man\" EP in October. Their appearance at the \"Crossroads Festival\" was recorded and released in the form of the \"Live at Rockpalast\" EP in March 2014.\n\nThe debut album\nIn July 2014 they released their first album, Blues Pills, the special edition of which included a DVD of their appearance in the \"Hammer of Doom\" festival from the year before. Shortly after the release of the first album, Cory Berry was replaced with new drummer Andr\u00e9 Kvarnstr\u00f6m.\n\nIn the summer of 2014 they appeared in the \"Sweden Rock Festival\", in Gelsenkirchen's \"Rock Hard Festival\" in June and in the famous Montreux Jazz Festival in July 2014.\n\nThe album became successful in Europe, climbing to No. 4 in Germany and No. 10 in Switzerland, while it also reached British charts at No. 68.\n\n2016\u2013present: Lady in Gold\nDuring the end of 2015 and the start of 2016, the band started writing and recorded for their second album. On 22 April, 2016, Blues Pills announced that Lady in Gold will be released on August 5, 2016 through Nuclear Blast Records with a ten track set-list.\n\nIn 2016, Blues Pills will tour with Kadavar, play festivals in the summer in North America and Europe followed by a UK tour in November.\n\nStudio albums\nBlues Pills (2014)\nLady in Gold (2016) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Blues+Pills\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Artists like Toto, Peter Gabriel and Jamiroquai all the way through to Ed Banger, Kavinsky, Goldroom and Ben Khan.Using Reason and Abletonit was some 3 years before Oliver felt he had perfected his workenough to actually put it online and let others hear his music.

Having already gained props from industry heavy weights such as Duke Dumont, Tensnake, Gorgon City and The Magician, the last 18 months have been nothing short of defining for this on-form duo.\n\nHaving grown up together from a young age, Lewis and Laurie have created a unique production recipe that is firmly focused on the art of creating organics, multi-dimensional music. Drawing on their experiences as musicians - Laurie playing the drums, and Lewis playing guitar - their productions start from simple grooves that slowly introduce the smooth and addictive melodies that the boys have become so known for.\n\n2013 saw Just Kiddin make their introduction via Nurvous Records with the \u2018Intimacy\u2019 EP. After being premiered by XLR8R, the online support poured in with features on Do You Like That Sound and Gotta Dance Dirty to name but a few. \n\nWith a new fan base developing, their eagerly awaited follow up release \u2018Time, Space & Honey\u2019 came on Ministry Of Sound\u2019s underground imprint HK Records. The online support was overwhelming with features on Clash, Noisey, Sub Soul, Topman CTRL and Eton Messy, which saw Just Kiddin starting to play shows around the UK alongside acts such as Bohdi, Second City, Leftwing & Kody and Cause & Effect.\n\nComing from a musical and DJ background, their club performances have also brought rapturous acclaim. Breaking the mould of the laborious bedroom producer turn DJ - Just Kiddin are a welcomed breath of fresh air behind the booth, bringing charisma, energy and faultless tune selection at any given time of the night. Such skills have won them numerous plaudits from promoters and clubbers a like, showing signs that they have what it takes to take centre stage.\n\nJust Kiddin\u2019s breakthrough came when they were invited to remix Claptone\u2019s summer hit \u2018No Eyes\u2019 on Exploited Records. Their remix was premiered exclusively by Mixmag and went on to feature in their Top 10 Exclusive Downloads of 2013 at #4, garnering a cool three million views on YouTube channel The Sound You Need along the way. \n\nThey were quick to react with a special free download on Eton Messy Records called \u2018Feeling Better\u2019. Having been a prominent feature in their sets over the summer, \u2018Feeling Better\u2019 caught the attention of Rob Da Bank on BBC Radio 1, who dedicated the track to all of his fellow DJ\u2019s and friends that had been in Ibiza with him that season. A fitting tribute to such a sun soaked song. Further Radio 1 support came from B.Traits, Monki and Phil & Alice - making the release a huge success.\n\nClosing the year with a double feature on Black Butter Records \u2018Spread Love Vol. 3\u2019 compilation, Just Kiddin have laid the foundations for a glittering 2014 - starting proceedings with a bona fide summer anthem \u2018Thinking About It\u2019 that is already picking up serious attention. \n\nSince being secretly premiered as the opening track on The Magician\u2019s \u2018Magic Tape 41\u2019, and featuring as an untitled track on Soundcloud channel #Unknown, \u2018Thinking About It\u2019 has instantly caught the attention of music lovers worldwide and initially generated an online hunt to unveil it\u2019s creator. This interest led to US based online tastemaker Thump! posting a feature entitled \u2018The Magician knows how to pick a winner\u2019 where they stated \u2018whatever song he uses to start off his mix inevitably becomes internet sensation\u2019.

Alive also released the early, garage demos collection \u201c3 and 3 Quarters\u201d,\u00a0and the live record, \u201cLive in California\u201d, which New York Music Daily cited as the Best Heavy Psych Album\u00a0of 2016.<br><br> Since the live album was released, RADIO MOSCOW has made the leap to a worldwide deal with Century\u00a0Media Records, said Parker Griggs, \u201cWe couldn&#39;t be more stoked to be joining the Century Media family!\u00a0When we met these guys we spent hours nerding out on obscure classics from our favorite era of rock \u2018n\u2019\u00a0roll (1965-1974).... so we feel right at home!\u201d<br><br> The first result of this new collaboration is \u201cNew Beginnings\u201d, which offers a powerful 10-track blues rock\u00a0ride which was recorded at Lost Ark Studio in San Diego with Mike Butler, produced by the band\u2019s own\u00a0Parker Griggs, and mastered by Mark Chalecki at Little Red Book Mastering. From the bursting guitar licks\u00a0of opening track \u201cNew Beginning\u201d over to the road dog anthem \u201cDriftin\u2019\u201d and the Hendrix-like groove of\u00a0\u201cNo One Knows Where They\u2019ve Been\u201d, from the pounding \u201cPacing\u201d to moody album closer \u201cDreams\u201d,\u00a0RADIO MOSCOW present an authentic and electrifying mix of versatile guitar play, the passionate raw howl\u00a0of Parker Griggs and a tight, energetic rhythm section.<br><br> Known as a brilliant live act, RADIO MOSCOW have toured and performed with the likes of Graveyard,\u00a0Witchcraft, Joe Bonamassa, Pentagram, the Sheepdogs, Nebula, and Bang. They played the Up in Smoke\u00a0tour in Europe (with Colour Haze) which included an appearance on the legendary German television\u00a0program Rockpalast, where the band performed a set, played acoustic and were interviewed. In 2016 they\u00a0played the Ride Festival, Desert Daze, Electric Funeral, End Hip End It, the Psycho California festival, and\u00a0as is only appropriate, have headlined shows in both St. Petersburg and Moscow in Russia. Also for \u201cNew\u00a0Beginnings\u201d, RADIO MOSCOW will tour internationally, US dates were completed in June/July 2017, UK dates are confirmed for August, and a full European tour kicks off September 26th, 2017. So if you are\u00a0looking for the fine art of rock, RADIO MOSCOW will bring waves of fuzzy, hard rocking riffs and sweaty,\u00a0cranked up blues right to you!\u00a0RADIO MOSCOW \u2013 New Beginnings<br><br><br><br> In a time where everybody has to put a label on a band to try and separate or distinguish what kind of music they play, Amplified Heat adopts Lemmy from Motorhead&#39;s philosophy....ROCK AND ROLL! Emitting a truly menacing blues psych-rock sound from four massive walls of double stacked Marshall and Fender cabinets and a 1966 Ludwig drum kit in between - Amplified Heat continues the Texas tradition of pure, fearless rock and roll. <br><br> From Cali, Colombia the Ortiz brothers have been playing music together since the early 90\u2019s and formed Amplified Heat in 2003. Based on a tradition of bone rattling blues they take a direct approach to intense riff slinging - never pulling punches and delivering the real deal with every sonic tsunami they unleash. The band has released four full length EP\u2019s and their next album \u201cMadera\u201d is due out in early 2018. The band\u2019s sound pulls from a variety of influences including Cream, Jimi Hendrix, Black Sabbath, Canned Heat, Motorhead, ZZ top, and Deep Purple. <br><br> Amplified Heat has shared the stage with Blue Cheer, The Black Angels, Clutch, Thee Oh Sees, Honky, Atomic Bitchwax, Kylesa, Kadavar, Ian Moore, Dead Meadow, Corky Lang\u2019s Mountain, Buffalo Killers, Nashville Pussy, Dresden 45, and Roky Erickson amongst many others. They make multiple appearances every year at Austin\u2019s South by Southwest Festival, have played at Ohio based Emissions from the Monolith Festival, and Oakland California\u2019s Burger Bugaloo. <br><br><a href=\"http://bit.ly/RadioMoscow0103TIX\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>", "img": null, "title": "RADIO MOSCOW", "url": "http://atlanta.eventful.com/events/radio-moscow-/E0-001-109215124-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Center Stage", "city": "Atlanta"}], "description": "Roky Erickson (born Roger Kynard Erickson on July 15, 1947) is an American singer, songwriter, harmonica player and guitarist from Austin, Texas. He was a founding member of the 13th Floor Elevators, who are considered to be one of the first two bands to ever use the word \"psychedelic\" ( + see The Deep) to describe rock music. See also Roky Erickson & the Aliens and Roky Erickson & The Explosives.\n\nIn 1969 the band were all arrested for possession of marijuana and Roky was incarcerated in Rusk State Hospital for the Criminally Insane where he reportedly underwent electroshock therapy and was placed on Thorazine amongst other controversial treatments. Many claim he has never been the same since. Sadly in the intervening years record execs and managers displayed the bad side of the music business and took full advantage of his condition often leaving him living in poverty while they hoarded all the cash.\n\nIn 2001 Roky's youngest brother, Sumner Erickson (ex-tuba player for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra), was appointed his legal guardian and an improvement in Roky's faculties has been reported since, leading to a return to live shows.\n\nAn excellent documentary on Roky, \"You're gonna miss me\" (2005), chronicled his troubled life - his schizophrenia, incarceration for possession of a joint, and talented and eccentric family.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Roky+Erickson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Bart Crow is coming your way.<p>Always known as \u201cthe nice guy\u201d with a smile on his face, the tides are turning and the gloves are coming off. Bart Crow is still the kind of guy and artist fans in the South and Midwest have grown to love. But on his new album The Parade, boundaries disappear and things are getting real.<p>The road-toughened troubadour and his band have already logged thousands of miles playing 130+ dates a year in front of loyal rowdy crowds at far-flung, late-night clubs and concert halls all over Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Nebraska and beyond. It\u2019s his music that draws them \u2014 a tangle of roots in blues, country and down-home rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, branded with his unique imprint. They hear their lives in his lyrics, written in the tradition of Townes Van Zandt, Steve Earle and other true-life troubadours.<p>With no help from big-time labels, and money pulled from his own pockets, Crow has put together an admirable track record as a recording artist, having lofted six No. 1 singles onto the Texas Music Chart \u2013 one of which, \u201cWear My Ring,\u201d sold over 165,000 copies. He has sold over 40,000 albums, released five self-produced albums in just over a decade, including Dandelion, which debuted at No. 1 on Billboard\u2018s Heatseekers South Central chart. He\u2019s been cheered in Country Weekly, on CMT and in other national media outlets. His YouTube videos and concert footage have drawn more than 2.5 million views.<p>He\u2019s chiseled his foothold in the edifice of Americana through hard work, talent, determination and a deep love for making music and building the best life he can for his wife Brooke and three kids, Townes and twins River and Parsons.<p>Myriad spirits haunt his music\u2013 a choir of real American country in the fashion of Merle and Waylon, John Conlee, George Jones and Jerry Jeff Walker, razor-edged rock from Metallica, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, deep-fried Southern soul from Otis Redding and more.<p>Yet in the end, Bart Crow is what you get: a blue-collar balladeer with his own unique message.<p>It comes across loud and clear on his newest set of passionate songs and performances, The Parade. Released in partnership with Thirty Tigers, it spotlights an artist whose story will feel familiar to all Americans who know what it means to survive in challenging times.<p>\u201cI can relate to blue-collar folks everywhere because I don\u2019t know any difference between them and me,\u201d he insists. \u201cMy uncle is a fireman who works on a ranch on his days off. My other uncle is a fireman. My brother works as a construction superintendent. I\u2019ve worked construction too. I\u2019ve stained decks and built fences in 110-degree weather. My father grew up white-trash broke, a ninth-grade dropout. He eventually became a self-made multi-millionaire with his own commercial drywall corporation, but we didn\u2019t have luxury growing up.\u201d<p>Another uncle stoked Crow\u2019s imagination about living a wanderer\u2019s life. \u201cHe was a professional rodeo cowboy,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI used to think that was the most amazing thing on the planet. He\u2019d come home from two or three weeks on the road and tell stories about being in Cheyenne and then somewhere else the last night. Even more than music, this idea of the nomadic lifestyle was very romantic to me.\u201d<p>This perspective is central to The Parade, with the added element of Crow\u2019s experiences. He grew up in tiny Maypearl, Texas, made his first attempts to write songs while in the United States Army and geared up to his current regimen as a performer on weekends while studying at Tarleton State University in Stephenville, TX. Perhaps the most significant milestone in his past involved moving with his future wife Brooke to Austin, where they worked together to get him started as an artist.<p>\u201cI guess we just don\u2019t know any different way to live than with me gone for six or eight months a year. After a decade-plus, this is just who we are. This is what we do. Besides,\u201d he adds, with a laugh, \u201cit\u2019s probably the foundation of our marriage that my knucklehead ass is gone a lot.\u201d<p>Like the border that divides his hometown from dreams of what lies beyond in his song \u201cCity Limits Signs,\u201d Crow\u2019s boundaries are dissolving. Wedding plainspoken poetry to powerful hooks and grooves, The Parade transforms daily occurrences into stories with universal resonance.<p>Not everyone has spent months far from home as Crow documents with irony on \u201cFree Like Me,\u201d dreamy loneliness on \u201cVapor Trails\u201d and truth telling love affair with music on \u201cDear Music,\u201d where he finds himself in \u201canother where-the-hell-am-I town.\u201d<p>Fewer still have weathered years on the honky-tonk circuit while staying faithful to their dream, a struggle Crow recounts on \u201cTop of Rock Bottom.\u201d (\u201cI won\u2019t be laying down on that Florida-Georgia Line,\u201d he sings, with what he insists is respect and empathy.)<p>Still, whether you\u2019ve fought to keep your own business alive or adapt to a soul-grinding cubicle gig, you\u2019ll get the message. And if you\u2019ve been burned or saved by love, you\u2019ll see yourself in the deft imagery of \u201cQueen of the Heartache Parade,\u201d the sweet pain of \u201cOne Night with You,\u201d the worldly-wise \u201cHere We Go Again\u201d and the insights that weave throughout \u201cLife Comes at You Fast.\u201d<p>New listeners may go beyond enjoying The Parade to identify with Crow as someone who knows first-hand the challenges of balancing one\u2019s dreams, integrity, responsibilities and reality.<p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty damn scary when you\u2019re raising a family off of touring and it becomes time to cut a new album, which means investing up to $70,000 of my own money,\u201d he admits. \u201cMy 4-year-old, Townes, starts preschool in August. Our 17-month-old twins, River and Parsons, are blowing through diapers left and right. And I\u2019ve got to take money that could be going to their college funds, more money than I have in my personal checking account, sit down at the crap table of life, roll the dice and hope that someone falls in love with the 11 or 12 songs we picked.\u201d<p>That\u2019s why Crow\u2019s dream at this point involves more than spreading appreciation for his music from coast to coast. \u201cI want to go to Seattle and Spokane and all the West and East Coast spots and the South, to DC and Manhattan and Connecticut. and have people show up and sing along with us,\u201d he insists. \u201cI want to hear people all over America come up to me and say, \u2018Hey, we got married to your song!\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Have you been on iTunes? Do you know how many frigging songs are on there \u2014 and you chose mine?\u2019 I don\u2019t take that lightly.\u201d<p>No, more even than that, he wants what everyone who discovers his music wants as well. \u201cI\u2019d love to go to bed at night and not fear for what\u2019s going to happen next month or next year. I used to say, when we bought our tour bus, we were one backstroke away from being dead in the water. It would be nice to earn that through selling tickets and playing in so many of these beautiful cities I\u2019d love to see.\u201d<p>That dream is within reach now, because Crow\u2019s story is your story too. All you need to do is listen \u2014 and join The Parade.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>", "img": null, "title": "Bart Crow", "url": "http://littlerock.eventful.com/events/bart-crow-/E0-001-110348521-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Stickyz Rock N Roll Chicken Shack", "city": "Little Rock"}], "description": "The Alexandrov Ensemble (also known as the Red Army Choir) is an official army choir of the Russian armed forces.

Alexandrov Academic Song and Dance Ensemble of the Russian Army (Russian: \u0410\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0430\u043d\u0441\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u044c \u043f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u043b\u044f\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0410\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0410. \u0412. \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430, Akademichesky ensemble pesni i plyaski Rossiyskoy Armii imeni A.

The Red Army Choir singers and dancers were en route to Syria to entertain Russian troops there for Orthodox Christmas celebrations.\n\nAt the establishment, in 1928, the choir was named Red Army Song Ensemble of the M. V. Frunze Red Army Central House (\u0410\u043d\u0441\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0430\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438 \u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0410\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u041c. \u0412. \u0424\u0440\u0443\u043d\u0437\u0435). In 1935, it was renamed Red-Bannered Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble of the USSR (\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0451\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u043d\u0441\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0430\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u043b\u044f\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420).\n\nIn 1949 the ensemble was officially named the A. V. Alexandrov Twice Red-bannered and Red-starred Song and Dance Ensemble of the Soviet Army (\u0414\u0432\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0451\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0440\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u044b \u0430\u043d\u0441\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u044c \u043f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u043b\u044f\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0410\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0410. \u0412. \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430). In 1978 the word \"academic\" was added to the title (A. V. Alexandrov Twice Red-bannered and Red-starred Academic Song and Dance Ensemble of the Soviet Army). After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the ensemble received its present name in 1998.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army_Choir <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Red+Army+Choir\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

word perfect is like my, favorite word\nLet me tell you\nAbout my journey for perfection and why I should've got off the train along time ago\nBut for some reason the doors, they just won't open for me man, life\n\nHigh as fuck, turnt up\nNigga giving no fucks\nHigh as fuck, turnt up\nNigga giving no fucks\nHigh as fuck, turnt up\nNigga giving no fucks\n\nI'm 24 years old, and you can ask anybody about me\nThey probably tell you the same thing\nHe fly as hell, he fresh as fuck\nHe probably feelin' some type of way\nI already know what they was gon' say\n'Cause they the reason I feel this way\nBut they'll never say it, they'll never say it\nSo the only soul I fuck with, is my Jordan's and my mama\nAnd both girls I ever loved, had to call it quits cause the drama\nSo I stop searching for love, and kept smoking this loud\n'Cause I thought when you this high, that you couldn't feel this down\n\nI was wrong again (these hoes are ridiculous)\nI was wrong again (real ridiculous)\nNiggas gon' hear this song and probably think I'm going in (them niggas lame too)\nBut if you a real nigga, and you think that you know me\nAnd you say that you my homie, then you shouldn't have to worry\nCause this song for them fuck niggas, and niggas who I don't fuck with\nNow you wonder who he talkin' bout\nIf you had to wonder, then the shoe fits\nI don't understand these people just like I don't understand this government\nAll I see is these new buildings, but single mothers still struggling\nI still see these homeless children, they ain't got no role models\nAnd my flow is like flat screen, and y'all niggas is floor models\nI get legal money and illegal money, but even legal money ain't legal homie\nCause the government gon' take it from us, so my middle finger is up (fuck 'em)\n\nThe best part about being me, is I ain't nothing like you\nAnd if you were me then you probably wouldn't like you\nThe best part about life man, just should be living it\nBut every time I try man, I just keep getting into shit\nSo I ain't changing for nobody, if you don't like me that's your problem\nWe can shoot the one if need to, cause real niggas gon' stay true\nIt always surprise me, that the realest niggas be the fakest man\nAnd the underdog be greatest man, I said the underdog be the greatest man\nI just wish I had a little help, like Marlon Wayans in 6th man\nBut I don't see it happening, might drop a tape and never rap again\nGot a couple fans, hope they female\nWent from selling clothes to weed sales\nIf I had yo bitch, nigga don't ask me no details\n\nYeah man, that's pretty much\nThat's the end of the tape\nHope you enjoyed\nIf you didn't\nWhat can I tell u\nYou listened\nFuck nigga", "youtube": {"duration": 122, "date_published": "2013-04-12

BRANDEN & JAMES, the Cello and Vocal duo, brings the soulful timbre of James on his cello combined with Branden&#39;s emotional and powerful vocals, creating a sound that leaves audiences feeling moved and inspired. the always supportive, sometimes haunting power of the cello accompanying Branden&#39;s voice solidifies the classical sound, adds new depth to the popular, and allows the audience to just sit back and take it inso movingly, that you may forget to breathe! says Paul Lisnek - Host of Broadway in Chicago Backstage. The energy and fervor behind their music has a story to tell of their unique pairing. Branden had a successful career on stage and in recording prior to his meeting the Australian cellist, James. Some of Branden&#39;s accolades include finishing as 2013 Finalist on Americas Got Talent, appearances at The Metropolitan Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago and Los Angeles Opera, two world tours with the renowned Twelve Tenors and two solo releases worldwide. James brought to the mix his own share of musical accomplishments, studying as a pianist at a young age and a career in music education before discovering performance as his ultimate love.

Tats\u00e4chlich hat er nicht gerade die angenehmsten Geschichten aus seiner Kindheit und Jugend zu berichten: Crack raubte August Alsina schon fr\u00fch die Vaterfigur, er siedelte mit seiner Mutter von New Orleans nach Houston um und fand, inspiriert von Gr\u00f6\u00dfen wie Lauren Hill, schlie\u00dflich zur Musik. 2011 zog der mittlerweile 25-j\u00e4hrige R&B S\u00e4nger nach Atlanta, landete einen Management-Deal und legte 2012 mit &quot;The Product\u201c sein erstes Mixtape vor. Als dann &quot;I Luv This Shit\u201c feat. Trinidad James herauskam, waren die Weichen f\u00fcr seinen Solo-Durchbruch gestellt. Sein Deb\u00fctalbum &quot;Testimony\u201c, welches 2014 ver\u00f6ffentlicht wurde, schaffte es auf Platz zwei der US Billboard Charts. Es folgten Features mit Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj und Chris Brown, sowie eine gemeinsame Tour mit Usher. Gerade seine bedingungs- und schonungslose Ehrlichkeit begeisterte nicht nur die Kritiker, sondern verhalf ihm auch zu massiven Chart-Erfolgen. Im selben Jahr war August Alsina in mehreren Kategorien bei den BET Awards nominiert. Den Award als &quot;Best New Artist\u201c nahm er am Schluss dann auch mit nach Hause. 2015 folgte dann sein zweites Album &quot;This Thing Called Life\u201c, welches auch in die Top 20 der Billboard Charts einstieg.

While Ferg and Rocky were originally planned to be the crew&#39;s Mobb Deep-like duo, they found more success as solo artists, beginning with Rocky and his series of 2012 mixtapes. Ferg&#39;s big break came that same year when his track &quot;Work&quot; landed as the key cut on A$AP Mob&#39;s Lords Never Worry mixtape. The announcement that A$AP Ferg signed with RCA came in early 2013 and was followed by an all-star remix of &quot;Work,&quot; with Trinidad James, French Montana, and ScHoolboy Q added to the cut. Ferg&#39;s &quot;Persian Wine&quot; single landed that same year, along with his solo album Trap Lord.

Disparities in access, use and outcomes persist across health care services, public health, and social determinant of health domains \u2013 what are essential elements for us to be able to identify those disparities and then work to address them? This session will describe cancer health disparities, review proven strategies for promoting cancer equity, and provide a framework for improving our own organization\u2019s capacity to provide high quality care and services for all. E.

Sessions and Tracks Innate immunity Innate immune responses are not specific to a particular pathogen or non-self-ingredient in the way that the adaptive immune responses are. They depend on a group of proteins and phagocytic cells that recognize conserved features of pathogens and become quickly activated to help destroy invaders. The innate immune system is essentially made up of barriers that aim to keep viruses, bacteria, parasites, and other foreign particles out of your body or limit their ability to spread and move throughout the body. Defense Mechanisms General Immune Responses \u00a0Phagocytes & Macrophages The Complement System Host-Pathogen Interactions Pathogen sensing and restriction Pathological inflammation in response to microbes \u00a0 Regulation of T/B cell responses For immunomodulation and\u00a0\u00a0 suppression of immune responses it needs regulation of immune cells. As Aberrant T/B cell responses developed wide range of diseases, including asthma and allergy and autoimmune diseases and many immunological disorders as T/B cells are the main route of the immune response ans its very important to regulate there function by different mechanism . Immune Regulator Interferon\u2019s Signalling Pathways Suppression & Stabilization of T/B Cells SIGNALING CASCADES (CYTOKINE SIGNALS) Adaptive immunity The adaptive immune system, also known as the acquired immune response which is more specific immune response then the innate immune response.\u00a0 Adaptive immune response is composed of highly specialized, systemic cells and processes that eliminate or prevent pathogen growth. It having ability to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently which creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen and lead to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. Immunological memory Vaccine development Immune Responses: Primary and Secondary Germinal centres Affinity maturation & Selection Antibody - mediated immunity Infectious Diseases and Immune System Infectious diseases are disorders caused by organisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites and immune system recognise them as non-self-antigen and produce immune response against them to protect our host cell from harmful infections. PathogenesisTropical infectionsViral infectionsSurgical Site InfectionsFungal infectionsInfections Prevention and Control Immunological basis for Immunization disease The Immunological Basis for immunization was initially developed in 1993 as a set of eight modules focusing on the vaccines included in the Expanded Programme on immunization (EPI). It\u2019s the development of the Global Immunization Vision and Strategy of Immunization disease. Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals Immunological Responses to Immunization Immunization Series Current Research on Immunization Global Immunization Vision and Strategy Clinical immunology Clinical immunology is the study of diseases caused by disorders of the immune system. It also involves diseases of other systems, where immune reactions play a part in the pathology and\u00a0clinical\u00a0features of immune response. In the Clinical immunology the molecular and cellular bases of immunological disease mostly studied. ImmunodermatologyImmunotoxicologyClinical Laboratory ImmunologyImmunological DiseasePrimary ImmunodeficiencyNeuroimmunology Cellular Immunology Cellular Immunology is a broad area of in vitro and in vivo studies of cellular immune responses in the immune system. In the Cellular Immunology mostly study the mechanisms that regulate innate and adaptive functions of dendritic cells (DCs) during priming of T cells immunity on the cellular level. Diagnostic ImmunologyImmunomodulationImmunotherapeuticsCellular and Molecular Immunology ResearchMolecular & Cellular ImmunologyRegional ImmunologyRegional Immunology offers a new approach to communication in the field of immunology. The stated purpose of the journal is &quot;to provide a focus for the judicious dissemination of results of experimental studies of immune activities as they are induced, expressed, and regulated in different regions of the body. Mucosal ImmunologyImmune MechanismsOcular ImmunologyAutoimmune diseasePediatric immunology Transplantation ImmunologyTransplantation is the act of transferring cells, tissues, or organs from one site to another in the living body. Most of the kidney, liver, heart, lung, or pancreas main organs transplant from a donor to recipient. But the immune system is the most formidable barrier to transplantation as a treatment. The immune system is developed very specifically and effectively to recognise foreign agents and self-antigen of the body, and this mechanisms are also involved in the rejection of transplanted organs of the body and reject the transplantation. Organ transplantation failureHair TransplantationPediatric TransplantBone marrow TransplantTransplantation Technologies & ResearchTransplantation RejectionViral Immunology & Infection control Viral Immunology delivers cutting-edge peer-reviewed research on emerging, rare, and under-studied viruses, with special focus on analyzing mutual relationships between external viruses and internal immunity. Active immunization involves administering a virus preparation that stimulates the body&#39;s immune system to produce its own specific immunity against virus. Immunopathology and Immunodeficiencies The Immunopathology and Immunodeficiencies is innate and acquired immunity, passive and active immunization and immunopathologies, such as hypersensitivity reactions, autoimmunity and immunodeficiency and all disorders which cause by immune system.The Immunopathology is a branch of medicine that deals with immune responses associated with immunological disorders, and the Immunodeficiencies is immune system&#39;s ability to fight infectious disease get low or absent.

He has signed a major record deal with Def Jam Recordings, and is the CEO of his own record label Gold Gang Records.\n\nHis debut single, \u201cAll Gold Everything\u201d has charted at 77 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It\u2019s from his debut mixtape, Don\u2019t Be S.A.F.E., released on October 16, 2012. Like many other artists in the Hip-Hop industry, Trinidad James found his way to the mainstream audience via The Source Magazine\u2019s Unsigned Hype column.\n\nThere\u2019s no hotter commodity in hip-hop right now than Trinidad James. After we named him one of the new Atlanta rappers to watch out for, the 25-year-old rapper has blown-up overnight, propelled by his viral smash \u201cAll Gold Everything,\u201d thanks in large to an irresistibly charming music video and a really catchy lyric about Molly.\n\n\u2026 he played his first headlining show in NYC and it was absolute pandemonium with fans, celebrities, and industry insiders stuck standing outside after the venue was packed to capacity. Inside, James proved that even if you\u2019re skeptical of the hype, he puts on one hell of a show, and the hundreds of camera phones on-hand caught video clips that serve as sufficient proof of that.\n\nIf you sit down with James, it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s intelligent, self-aware, and a natural born hustler. He hasn\u2019t been rapping professionally for long, but he clearly understands hip-hop, its culture, and most importantly, the genre\u2019s trends.\n\nThe day after his Big Apple performance, we had ATL\u2019s newly-minted star stop by the Complex office (he showed up on time, the rarest of feats for a rapper) for a conversation in which we attempted to find out, Who Is Trinidad James? James told us about being recruited by labels, his relationship with A$AP Rocky, hustling Pok\u00e9mon cards, his city\u2019s buzzing music scene, and much more. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Trinidad+James\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

McPherson calls the getaway the most fun Ive had since I was 15 years old and returned to Nashville with a clear head, internal filters successfully stifled, ready to move forward. That fresh perspective in tow, McPherson learned that the long-shot backup studio, the legendary RCA Studio B in Nashville, was willing to host his band for the making of the record. RCA Studio B was fundamental to the creation of the Nashville Sound, and the ghosts of some of the greatest songs in history live within its walls: Dolly Partons I Will Always Love You, and Elvis Presleys Are You Lonesome Tonight? among them. Artists who choose to record at Studio B are met with a rigorous list of requirements, including using a recording method appropriate during the studios heyday. Since the studio is a working museum by day, the entirety of McPhersons workspace had to be reset at night: Load in all equipment in the late afternoon, work until 3:00 or 4:00 a.m., and leave no trace nightly. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Those rules would probably turn a lot of bands off, but they turned us on, 100 percent, McPherson says. I really love walking into a classic studio as much as I love getting my hands on a really old guitar. I like knowing that something was used for a long time and has good things in it.But this isnt an old Nashville record, by any measurement, nor is it the record McPherson set out to make, with credit due to co-producer Dan Molad (also the drummer for Lucius). Theres a pretty broad gap in our tastes, what we do and what were into, McPherson says. Where hes as likely to lean on The Cramps as he is Irma Thomas for inspiration, Molads left-field production suggestions included a Casio synthesizer and running a Fender Rhodes through a tape delay. (McPherson nixed the former; the latter became the signature sound of one of the records tracks.) We ended up learning a lot from each other, and he did a lot of stuff Id have never thought to do. During the song Lets Get Out of Here While Were Young, JD sputters the line Weve worn out all the songs weve sung. This is not a statement McPherson takes lightly. This record was difficult for me to make, difficult to write, difficult to record. It took a lot for me to say that I cant force these songs to be the way people are expecting, McPherson says.

Each song becomes like a spring-loaded can of worms: there\u2019s all this energy boxed up in a neat little package, and then when you come see us live, the cap comes off and the contents fly out in every direction like fireworks.\u201d<p>It\u2019s a whimsically apt metaphor for Pigeons Playing Ping Pong, a band whose very existence is rooted in the unyielding quest for joy and positive energy. Blending infectious funk grooves, psychedelic jams, and experimental electronics, the Baltimore four-piece\u2019s new album, \u2018Pizazz,\u2019 is a buoyant, blissful reminder of just how much fun music can be. Eschewing the traditional funk band lineup that typically includes keyboards, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong constructs effervescent soundscapes with just two guitars, bass, and drums, crafting their music with a sophisticated ear for both open space and dense layering.<p>While \u2018Pizazz\u2019 is, in many ways, a familiar continuation of the journey that\u2019s earned the band its rapidly expanding and rabidly devoted following (known as The Flock), it also marks the beginning of a new chapter for Pigeons Playing Ping Pong. The album\u2019s eleven tracks are the group\u2019s first recorded with new drummer Alex Petropulos, whose airtight grooves and explosive power push the band\u2019s sound to new heights.<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had some of these songs in our live catalog for a while,\u201d says Ormont, \u201cbut playing them with Alex has breathed new life into everything. His style and energy have revealed nooks and crannies that we didn\u2019t even realize existed in the tracks. All music boils down to having a good drummer, especially in our dance-oriented jam world, and we\u2019ve got the best drummer I\u2019ve ever heard right now.\u201d<p>It\u2019s a bold claim, but Pigeons Playing Ping Pong has the live show to back it up. Glide Magazine called them \u201ca band that melts faces and pulls no punches,\u201d while C-Ville Weekly praised the growing \u201ccult around [their] high-energy music, goofy stage antics, and all around good vibes,\u201d and JamBase raved that guitarist/vocalist Jeremy Schon is \u201cdestined to become one of our generation\u2019s finest guitarists.\u201d Since the group\u2019s inception nearly a decade ago at the University of Maryland (where the band\u2019s name came to Ormont and Schon during a moment of transcendence in Psych 100), they\u2019ve built up a reputation as one of the most engaging and life-affirming acts on the road, maintaining a relentless tour schedule that has them performing up to 200 shows a year and hitting festivals from coast to coast. The band even founded their own gathering, Domefest, which recently celebrated its eighth year and attracted nearly 2,000 members of The Flock for an immersive weekend of love, music, and community.<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really important that our live show puts out as much energy as possible and promotes lightheartedness and positivity,\u201d says Schon. \u201cAll that matters in the moment at a concert is what\u2019s going on onstage and in the room around you, and we try to put on a show where people can really lose themselves in those moments and use our music as an outlet to feel good.\u201d<p>The band chased those same ideals when they headed into producer Steve Wright\u2019s WrightWay Studios in Baltimore to record \u2018Pizazz,\u2019 the follow-up to their 2016 fan-favorite \u2018Pleasure.\u2019 Tracking live on the floor, the foursome channeled all the rapture of their live shows into tight, crisp packages. Songs that may unfold onstage over the course of 20 minutes were reimagined for the studio, where they\u2019d need to reach the same frenzied, emotional heights, in less than half that time.<p>\u201cI think this album really shows attention to detail when it comes to choosing our moments and the way we\u2019ve been able to make parts more concise without losing their natural feel,\u201d says Ormont. \u201cHaving a strong drummer is a big part of that. Alex is able to convey so much feeling and bring us to those peaks and valleys really quickly and efficiently when we need him to.\u201d<p>\u2018Pizazz\u2019 opens up with the bouncing, carefree \u201cFun In Funk,\u201d which finds the band proclaiming, \u201cWe put the fun in funk\u201d over wah-wah guitars and an infectious rhythm section driven both by Petropulos\u2019s drums and Ben Carrey\u2019s fat, slinky bass lines.<p>\u201cFunk is very fun, upbeat, happy music to begin with,\u201d says Ormont. \u201cIt\u2019s our mission to put that fun into everything we do.\u201d<p>It\u2019s a mission that Pigeons Playing Ping Pong was born for. The visceral sense of joy in their music acts as a sort of glue here, binding the band\u2019s wildly versatile sounds into a cohesive and distinctive whole on the album. On \u201cSomethin For Ya,\u201d they channel 70\u2019s disco and pair it with a wicked prog-rock solo, while tracks like \u201cOffshoot\u201d and \u201cToo Long\u201d embrace the group\u2019s darker, more bass-and-electronics-influenced dance side. \u201cPoseidon\u201d and frequent show-closer \u201cOcean Flows,\u201d on the other hand, showcase Pigeons\u2019 bright, sparkling, melodic soul, as \u2018Pizazz\u2019 rises and falls with the same inimitable mix of precision and frenzy that defines the band\u2019s one-of-a-kind live show.<p>Each Pigeon is a virtuosic musician and improviser in his own right, and the band\u2019s songs are frequently born out of impromptu grooves and riffs. The swirling, trippy \u201cPorcupine,\u201d which clocks in at nearly eight minutes in all its jamming glory, taps into the uninhibited, open-ended nature of the band\u2019s rehearsal sessions, while the driving \u201cHenrietta\u201d grew out of one of Schon\u2019s soundcheck guitar loops.

Each song becomes like a spring-loaded can of worms: theres all this energy boxed up in a neat little package, and then when you come see us live, the cap comes off and the contents fly out in every direction like fireworks.Its a whimsically apt metaphor for Pigeons Playing Ping Pong, a band whose very existence is rooted in the unyielding quest for joy and positive energy. Blending infectious funk grooves, psychedelic jams, and experimental electronics, the Baltimore four-pieces new album, Pizazz, is a buoyant, blissful reminder of just how much fun music can be. Eschewing the traditional funk band lineup that typically includes keyboards, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong constructs effervescent soundscapes with just two guitars, bass, and drums, crafting their music with a sophisticated ear for both open space and dense layering.While Pizazz is, in many ways, a familiar continuation of the journey thats earned the band its rapidly expanding and rabidly devoted following (known as The Flock), it also marks the beginning of a new chapter for Pigeons Playing Ping Pong. The albums eleven tracks are the groups first recorded with new drummer Alex Petropulos, whose airtight grooves and explosive power push the bands sound to new heights.Weve had some of these songs in our live catalog for a while, says Ormont, but playing them with Alex has breathed new life into everything. His style and energy have revealed nooks and crannies that we didnt even realize existed in the tracks. All music boils down to having a good drummer, especially in our dance-oriented jam world, and weve got the best drummer Ive ever heard right now.Its a bold claim, but Pigeons Playing Ping Pong has the live show to back it up. Glide Magazine called them a band that melts faces and pulls no punches, while C-Ville Weekly praised the growing cult around [their] high-energy music, goofy stage antics, and all around good vibes, and JamBase raved that guitarist/vocalist Jeremy Schon is destined to become one of our generations finest guitarists. Since the groups inception nearly a decade ago at the University of Maryland (where the bands name came to Ormont and Schon during a moment of transcendence in Psych 100), theyve built up a reputation as one of the most engaging and life-affirming acts on the road, maintaining a relentless tour schedule that has them performing up to 200 shows a year and hitting festivals from coast to coast. The band even founded their own gathering, Domefest, which recently celebrated its eighth year and attracted nearly 2,000 members of The Flock for an immersive weekend of love, music, and community.Its really important that our live show puts out as much energy as possible and promotes lightheartedness and positivity, says Schon. All that matters in the moment at a concert is whats going on onstage and in the room around you, and we try to put on a show where people can really lose themselves in those moments and use our music as an outlet to feel good.The band chased those same ideals when they headed into producer Steve Wrights WrightWay Studios in Baltimore to record Pizazz, the follow-up to their 2016 fan-favorite Pleasure. Tracking live on the floor, the foursome channeled all the rapture of their live shows into tight, crisp packages. Songs that may unfold onstage over the course of 20 minutes were reimagined for the studio, where theyd need to reach the same frenzied, emotional heights, in less than half that time.I think this album really shows attention to detail when it comes to choosing our moments and the way weve been able to make parts more concise without losing their natural feel, says Ormont. Having a strong drummer is a big part of that. Alex is able to convey so much feeling and bring us to those peaks and valleys really quickly and efficiently when we need him to.Pizazz opens up with the bouncing, carefree Fun In Funk, which finds the band proclaiming, We put the fun in funk over wah-wah guitars and an infectious rhythm section driven both by Petropuloss drums and Ben Carreys fat, slinky bass lines.Funk is very fun, upbeat, happy music to begin with, says Ormont. Its our mission to put that fun into everything we do.Its a mission that Pigeons Playing Ping Pong was born for. The visceral sense of joy in their music acts as a sort of glue here, binding the bands wildly versatile sounds into a cohesive and distinctive whole on the album. On Somethin For Ya, they channel 70s disco and pair it with a wicked prog-rock solo, while tracks like Offshoot and Too Long embrace the groups darker, more bass-and-electronics-influenced dance side.

Here comes a walking fire\u2019 (King Lear) Metaphor is an intensely rich area of imaginative life. In the ability of metaphors to carry meaning from the known to the unknown, the conscious to the unconscious, they point toward the very heart of psychotherapeutic process. In this workshop we will explore the application of metaphors in clinical practice as well as the root metaphors embedded within psychological theory. The weekend will critique the limitations of technological metaphors hidden in much of therapeutic language. Ecological metaphors will be introduced that better convey the wildness and irregularity of human experience. In particular, we will draw upon the integration of psychotherapy with chaos theory and fractal geometry, contemporary perspectives which have emerged from the modelling of natural systems, such as cloud formations, lightning pathways and the beatings of the human heart.\u00a0 This seminar will support you to: Speak, think and see through metaphor, avoiding the dangers of concrete and literal language, thinking and perception. Work with \u2018living metaphor\u2019 from immediate experience in client fantasies, feelings, body sensations and gestures. Notice fractal patterns as metaphors of wholeness. Use the idea of a \u2018fractal psyche\u2019 to ground therapeutic insights in everyday life. Apply nonlinear perspectives from chaos theory to the therapeutic relationship, development and healing.\u00a0 Theoretical presentation will be grounded in clinical case study discussion, therapist-client role-play, experiential encounters with the local landscape and through attending to the group (i.e. yourself, others and the leader) as a nonlinear system. Further information: Mind-as-machine metaphors are woven into our everyday language. To speak of feeling \u2018shut down\u2019 or having \u2018blown a gasket\u2019; to consider our personality as an assemblage of component \u2018parts\u2019 -these colloquial usages are rooted in a common-sense assumption of a mechanical world, which has become internalised by the shaping of psychological theory firstly by mechanical and later computational metaphors. For example, Freud\u2019s psychodynamic theory, still very much in use today, rests upon the then cutting-edge hydrodynamic technology of the early 1900s, the steam engine. Technology has captured our imaginations and our very sense of self. But human beings are complex creatures embedded within a biosphere quite unlike the static, linear and controllable paradigm of mechanical technology. We are not machines and clinical practice is often anything but mechanical. Two key areas will be covered: 1. Living metaphors at the edge of chaos: \u00a0how by drawing on chaos theory we can view client symptoms as finely balanced, dynamic systems of complex forces; how in the zone between disorder and stability known as \u2018the edge of chaos\u2019 a tiny event can trigger significant \u2018phase change\u2019 (such as when boiling water turns into steam); we will explore the holistic sensitivity required to detect the spontaneous arising of these tiny events in the fantasies, feelings, bodily symptoms and gestures of \u2018living metaphor\u2019 \u2013 metaphors from immediate experience prior to conceptualisation and the dead-hand of generalised theory. 2. The fractal psyche as a metaphor of wholeness: how to cultivate our intuitive feel for fractal patterns, familiar already from nature (e.g. flickering flames, waves on an ocean, skin wrinkles and snail\u2019s shells); how to see each fractal image as a reflection of the whole, on ever finer scales ( like Russian Dolls); how any small piece of clinical material ( such as a dream, a passing comment, even how a client walks into the room) is a fractal image, reflective of the whole therapy and the client\u2019s history, current symptoms and emerging future; and how to work with fractals in clinical practice.\u00a0 \u00a0 The approach offers a perhaps surprising and counterintuitive non-linear understanding that shines new light on relationships, development and healing. However, it is expected participants will find familiarity within chaos theory as a way of thinking about recognisable, but often overlooked, aspects of clinical experience and also as a framework that resonates with psychological metaphors from pre-modern traditions such as alchemy and Buddhism. The presentation is influenced by the work of Terry Marks-Tarlow, Robert M. Galatzer-Levy, Arnold Mindell and David Abram.

But with a style that sometimes draws comparisons to JJ Cale and Daniel Lanois, this blues-influenced, New Orleans-inspired song and groove man, as hes been so aptly described, luckily found his rightful calling. Born in Quebec, his family moved to Boston when he was 12. He served a year in Vietnam as a Marine, struggled and overcame drug addiction, earned a pilots license in Colorado, then moved to Alaska, then Seattle, and Paris and New Orleans. But it took a close call while piloting a seaplane across the Canadian wilderness to make him decide it was time to get busy writing songs - gritty narratives inspired by a lifetime of hard-won knowledge set against his gritty, soulful guitar and harmonica playing.Hes since earned many accolades, including a Juno Award for his 1999 album, Gust of Wind. His post-Katrina ode, I Am the Big Easy, earned the International Folk Alliances 2009 Song of the Year Award, and in 2012, Bonneville won the solo/duet category in the Blues Foundations International Blues Challenge. He has guested on albums by Mary Gauthier, Gurf Morlix, Eliza Gilkyson, Ray Wylie Hubbard and other prominent artists, and shared songwriting credits with Tim OBrien, Phil Roy and Morlix, among others. Slaid Cleaves placed Bonnevilles Run Jolee Run on his lauded 2009 album, Everything You Love Will Be Taken Away.Ray is touring in support of Easy Gone, his fourth album for Red House Records. The album takes listeners to some of the dark spaces and exotic places Bonneville has gone on his own travels. An Austin resident since 2006, Bonneville still puts the rhythms and soul of New Orleans into much of his music. His songs carry a groove and momentum thats uniquely his and will always be a part of him, no matter where he roams.", "img": null, "title": "Ray Bonneville", "url": "http://washingtondc.eventful.com/events/ray-bonneville-/E0-001-109637859-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Hill Country BBQ", "city": "Washington"}, {"date": "2018-01-22 00:00:00", "description": " <strong>About:</strong><br><p><strong>ABOUT VOICES ON THE HUDSON </strong><p>This winter, City Vineyard (233 West St in Hudson River Park) will transform into a cozy, intimate music venue where acclaimed national touring artists will perform against the gorgeous background of the Hudson River and the downtown NYC skyline.

Upon finishing school in 1974, he and his brother formed a trio and went on to change the face of folk music in North America with their performances that left audiences breathless, records which to date have sold in the millions, and songs which have been sung and recorded by thousands around the globe.<p>Upon Stan\u2019s untimely death in 1983, Garnet set out on his own, forming, along with his parents, one of the very first independent record labels in North America, long before \u201cIndies\u201d became fashionable. Thus far, Garnet has written and recorded 18 highly acclaimed records to date; received a Juno nomination; and recorded either solo or with Grammy nominated American folk icon Greg Brown, as well as legendary Scottish singer Archie Fisher (recently made a Member of the British Empire at Buckingham Palace). Garnet also authored and recently published a memoir called <em>Night Drive</em>, a wild, funny, and vulgar telling of his years on the road with his brother. <em>Night Drive</em> has received uniformly rave reviews in North America and Europe, and continues to sell well.<p>Resolutely avoiding the mainstream music industry, Garnet has refused all offers from large record labels, with the exception of a \u201cbest-of\u201d compilation done with the highly respected Minneapolis record label Red House Records, the largest independent roots music label in North America. His own record label and publishing company, Snow Goose Records, remains family run.<p>Over the years Garnet has worked or appeared with artists such as the late Bill Morrissey (a Grammy-nominated writer, singer, and best-selling author), Mary Chapin Carpenter (five time Grammy-winning singer), the late Guy Clark, Shawn Colvin, folk legends Judy Collins and Tom Paxton, acclaimed British producer Brian Eno, Daniel Lanois (fellow Canadian and noted producer for U2), Bluegrass legend Bill Monroe, Harry Connick Jr., and many others.<p>Venues where Garnet has played include the Kennedy Center for the Arts in Washington DC, Lincoln Center in New York City, and the Victoria Ballroom in Vancouver (as special musical guest in an evening honoring Nelson Mandela). As well, he has played at nearly every major music festival in North America, and hundreds of smaller concert halls and clubs around the continent, from Florida to the Yukon, Newfoundland to San Diego.<p>Garnet Rogers has been a guest on NPR shows All Things Considered, A Prairie Home Companion, Good Evening with Noah Adams, Fresh Air with Terry Gross; as well, he\u2019s appeared on West Virginia\u2019s Mountain Stage, CBC\u2019s As It Happens, The Vicki Gabereau show, \u201cQ\u201d with Tom Power, Morningside with Peter Gzowski, and Swinging on a Star with Murray Maclaughlan.<p>Garnet is to be the subject of a documentary in the coming year, intended to touch on the travels and travails that make up the story of his touring life. The documentary is to be directed by Jonathan Silvers, the noted filmmaker whose most recent three-part series, \u201cDead Reckoning: War, Crime, and Justice from WW2 to the War on Terror,\u201d was featured on PBS in spring 2017.<p>Garnet Rogers continues to write, to record, and to tour all across Canada and the States. He spends his off-time between his home in Nova Scotia and his farm in Ontario, where his wife, Gail Parker-Rogers, breeds and raises thoroughbred horses, several of which can currently be found are on the US and Canadian Olympic Teams.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>", "img": null, "title": "Garnet Rogers", "url": "http://toronto.eventful.com/events/garnet-rogers-/E0-001-107892220-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "Canada", "venue": "Hugh's Room", "city": "Toronto"}], "description": "Daniel Lanois (born September 19, 1951 in Hull,  Qu\u00e9bec  is a Canadian record producer and singer-songwriter. He has produced albums for a wide variety of artists and released a number of albums of his own work. Artists he has worked with include Bob Dylan, U2, Brian Eno, Peter Gabriel, Robbie Robertson, Chris Whitley, Ron Sexsmith and Nash the Slash.\n\nHe started his production career working in his own studio, Grant Avenue Studios in Hamilton, Ontario. He worked with a number of local bands, most notably Martha and the Muffins, for whom his sister Jocelyne played bass, Ray Materick, as well as the Canadian children's singer Raffi. \n\nAfter being discovered by Brian Eno and working collaboratively with him on some of Eno's own projects, his career was given a huge boost when Eno invited him to co-produce U2's album The Unforgettable Fire. Along with Eno, he went on to produce U2's The Joshua Tree, the 1987 Grammy Winner for Album of the Year. Bono of U2 recommended Lanois to Bob Dylan in the late 1980s; in 1989 Lanois produced Dylan's Oh Mercy, widely considered one of Dylan's greatest later albums. Eight years later Dylan and Lanois worked together on Time Out of Mind, Dylan's first studio album of original material since 1990, which won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1997.\n\nWrecking Ball, his 1995 collaboration with Emmylou Harris, received almost unanimous critical praise (many critics placed the album on their year-end \"best albums of the year\" lists), and revived the aging country artist's career, bringing her to the attention of much younger rock audiences.\n\nAs well as being a producer, singer and songwriter, Daniel Lanois plays the guitar, pedal steel and drums. His desire is to bring out the best in the artists he works with and produces, with his wide range of talents and musical ideas.  He often leaves an atmospheric and emotionally resonant sound on the projects he produces, which some say has become his 'signature sound'. \n\nDaniel founded Red Floor Records to release his own music albums and DVD films that he sells direct to consumers from his website in high resolution downloads and traditional formats: www.DanielLanois.com\n\nAfter completing production work on U2's latest album \"No Line In The Horizon\" in 2009, Daniel has built a new recording studio in Toronto, which he has named \"The Temple\", as it is located on the site of a former Buddhist Temple.  He recently completed producing Neil Young's latest 2010 release, \"Le Noise\". However, on June 5th, 2010, while working on Young's album, Daniel was in a serious motorcycle accident near his Silver Lake area home of Los Angeles, and he had to postpone his latest personal priority project, Black Dub which features Daniel on guitars, world renown drummer/percussionist Brian Blade, bassist and harmony vocalist Daryl Johnson, and lead vocalist/keyboardist Trixie Whitley (the daughter of the late Chris Whitley).  \n\nBlack Dub have been signed to Jive Records and they are expected to commence a world tour in early 2011 supporting their debut self titled release, and they are currently doing special engagements throughout November and early December 2010 across the USA. \n\nDaniel has recently written an autobiographical memoir entitled \"Soul Mining, A Musical Life\" that can be pre-ordered and is expected to be officially released through traditional book store channels in late November 2010.  \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Daniel+Lanois\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Luke&#39;s reasons for choosing that title become clear the moment you dive into the new record -- as they do when he starts to describe its genesis, and the personal and emotional transformation he experienced while making it. &quot;To me,&quot; Luke continues, &quot;this album is about pure expression. Even the way we made the album felt fresh. Rather than us just being a band in a room, playing our guitars with the vocal over the top, which is what we&#39;d always done before, we were really listening to what was going on around us, picking up ideas. The whole thing was much more natural.&quot; &quot;Listen was&quot; kick-started by the track &quot;Around Town,&quot; the bare bones of which Luke laid down in his flat in London. The song&#39;s subject matter is catty, its melody infectious and immediate -- and, compared with the Kooks&#39; previous material, it represents a major shift. &quot;I&#39;d got really heavily into soul music and Afrobeat,&quot; Luke explains. &quot;I remember doing &#39;Around Town&#39; and thing, &#39;Hmm, ok: this is interesting.&#39; Everything, the whole album, crystallised around that one song. And it was only meant to be an experiment; I didn&#39;t think of it as a song for the Kooks at all. All of sudden, it became the direction. I think I was on a bit of a mission, looking back: I&#39;d gone all around the States for about 10 months, working with different people. I&#39;d only ever written by myself or with the other guys before, so it was something I was a bit dubious about to begin with. But I wanted to open up a bit. There was too much negativity in me; I knew I needed to get away, get back to who I am, which is a writer.&quot; Luke&#39;s chief ally in that task was the producer, Inflo, who he credits with helping him dig far deeper than he has before as a songwriter. The most powerful and haunting example of this on &quot;Listen&quot; is the poignant &quot;See Me Now,&quot; on which Luke addresses his father, who died when Luke was a young child. &quot;That was a real case of Inflo pulling a song, an emotion, out of me,&quot; says Luke. &quot;We were talking about it and he just said, &#39;Write a letter to your dad.&#39; A lot of the lyrics, I just wouldn&#39;t have been brave enough to share them before, but he went, &#39;Do it; they&#39;re beautiful.&#39; I found that completely disarming; his whole attitude was, &#39;That&#39;s what music is all about. Let all your defences down.&#39; And that song epitomises that.&quot; Choosing to work with a producer rooted in hip hop and dance music struck some of the people on team Kooks as a risk, Luke admits. &quot;I had heard his music and then his name came up when we were discussing how to approach the new album. I&#39;m not sure many people thought it could work, but I really wanted to meet him. I loved the sound on the records he&#39;d done -- they had this amazing clarity, they were modern but with this rootsy feeling behind them.&quot; Luke stuck to his guns, however, and his hunch proved correct. &quot;The moment I met him, it felt right; although we were, on the surface, from quite different backgrounds, I knew his cousin, Leona Lewis -- we were at school together, we&#39;d done songs together and made that sort of music. So in that sense, it felt almost like going back to something. I had &#39;Around Town&#39; already, and he then pulled all this other stuff out of me. He got where my head was at. We had such a strong connection.&quot; Evidence of that connection can be found throughout &quot;Listen.&quot; Lead single &quot;Down&quot; hares out of the traps, its staccato guitar, call-and-response vocals, punctuating cowbell, falsetto harmonies and self-knowing, defiant lyric (&quot;You can&#39;t break a man who&#39;s already down&quot;) adding up to one giant kiss-off of a song, to an earworm melody that puts down roots in your head and settles in for the long term. &quot;Around Town,&quot; so central and crucial to the album, rides in on a tide of joyful gospel harmonies, as Luke confesses &quot;I need someone to love me when the chips are down&quot;. Stripped-back, loose-limbed, lyrically candid and unblinking, &quot;Around Town&quot; comes across like a musical manifesto, a mission statement from a band who have rediscovered what they loved about making music in the first place, 10 long years ago in Brighton. Yet, as Luke says, the picture wasn&#39;t always so rosy. &quot;The experiences I&#39;d had the year before we made the record were so intense; I&#39;d never felt that low before. I was in a very poisonous relationship, and becoming quite vacuous in my life. Songs such as &#39;Down&#39; and &#39;Around Town&#39; are coming from that place, most of the record is. And things weren&#39;t going well with the band either; we were doing well, but on the inside, things were a mess. We needed to come out of that, and it really was a case of music saving us.&quot; Everyone in the band knew things had to change, Luke says. So out went the old thinking (&quot;The over-thinking,&quot; Luke laughs), and out, too, the old approach to the recording process. &quot;I went completely off chords. We got really obsessed with lines of notes. When you listen to Stones records, the genius of them is the interplay between them. They&#39;ll have a few chords, but it&#39;s much more about those interlayered guitar lines. Flo gave us the confidence to change our approach. It&#39;s difficult in the studio, because the temptation always is to go, &#39;Right, I&#39;m going to do my bit here, and you do that there&#39;. With this record, we didn&#39;t do any rehearsing beforehand. I&#39;d write a song with Flo, or on my own, put it up, and we&#39;d all play over it. So there was a real freedom to the process.&quot; Freedom is certainly the right word for &quot;Are We Electric?,&quot; whose sparse verse, resting on the sweetest of soul-funk grooves, gives way to a chorus of glorious, incandescent joy. One of many surprises on Listen, the track&#39;s warmth and laid-back vibe are replicated on &quot;Forgive & Forget,&quot; a song that is driven by one of those riffs guitarists dream of coming up with, with added call-to-the-dancefloor handclaps, and conjures up a band of friends and n&#39;er-do-wells cruising along a Californian highway, roof down, high on life. On &quot;London,&quot; the band come up with a &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; for the 21st century, as Luke surveys the riot-damaged city, over another monster riff. &quot;Dreams&quot; is similarly minimal, a woozy, just-woke-up ode to the places our heads go when they hit the pillow. Immersion in &quot;Listen&quot; is as liberating for us as the making of it was for the band -- in which case, job done, says Luke. &quot;We were back doing it for the love of it. I&#39;d had the hardest year of my life, so it felt like the shackles were being released. It&#39;s good when you can rise above all the shit that gathers around you. What&#39;s happened with our band has been pretty crazy, internally, for years. But it&#39;s great now. I&#39;ve never felt this comfortable before. It&#39;s like we&#39;ve found peace.&quot; He&#39;s so proud of the album, he says, that his hardest task now is stopping himself banging on about it. &quot;I know that I&#39;m in danger of being too confident about it, because in my head, I just think it&#39;s the best thing in the world; you always do when you come out of making a new record. But I&#39;ve got to keep that in check -- I don&#39;t want to go all Kanye West about it.&quot; Should Luke Pritchard fail in that vow of silence, well, he will deserve our forgiveness. Because do you know what?

They pioneered a raw approach to rhythm and blues (and later, psychedelia) that influenced a number of key bands of the 1960s British invasion, particularly The Rolling Stones, and David Bowie whose first hero was Phil May.\n\nPretty Things was preceded by Little Boy Blue and the Blue Boys which consisted of Dick Taylor, fellow Sidcup Art College student Keith Richards and Mick Jagger. When Brian Jones joined Little Boy Blue and the Blues Boys as guitarist, Taylor was pushed from playing guitar to bass and the Rolling Stones were formed.\n\nSeveral months later Dick Taylor (born Richard Clifford Taylor, 28 January 1943, in Dartford, Kent) quit the newly formed Rolling Stones to pursue his schooling when he was accepted at London Central School of Art, where he met up with Phil May (born Phillip Arthur Dennis Kattner, on 9 November 1944, in Dartford, Kent) and they formed Pretty Things.\n\nTaylor was once again playing his preferred guitar with May singing and playing harmonica. They recruited Brian Pendleton (born 13 April 1944 in Wolverhampton\u2013died 16 May 2001 in Maidstone, Kent) on rhythm guitar; John Stax (born John Edward Lee Fullegar, 6 April 1944 in Crayford, Kent) on bass; and, after trying a couple of different drummers, including Pete Kitley and Viv Andrews, stuck with Viv Prince (born Vivian St John Prince, 9 August 1944, in Loughborough, Leices).\n\nEarly career\n\nThey caused a sensation in England, and their first three singles \u2014 \"Rosalyn\" #41, \"Don't Bring Me Down\" #10, and the self-penned \"Honey I Need\" at #13 \u2014 appeared in the UK singles chart in 1964-1965. They never had a hit in the United States, but had considerable success in their native United Kingdom and in Australia, New Zealand, Germany, and the Netherlands in the middle of the decade. However, in the U.S. they, along with The Yardbirds and Van Morrison's Them, were a huge influence on hundreds of garage bands, including the MC5 and The Seeds.\n\nTheir early material was hard-edged blues-rock influenced by Bo Diddley (they took their name from Diddley's 1955 song \"Pretty Thing\" in humorous contrast to their unkempt long-haired appearance) and Jimmy Reed, much like that of their contemporaries The Stones and The Yardbirds. They were known for wild \"rock and roll\" behaviour and shocking the establishment; their song \"Midnight to Six Man\" defined the mod lifestyle. Around this time, the first of what would be many personnel changes over the years also began, with Prince the first to go late in 1965. He was replaced by Skip Alan. Pendleton left late in 1966, and was not initially replaced. Then, Stax quit early in 1967 and Jon Povey and Wally Waller joined to make the band a five piece once again.\n\nAfter an uncomfortable flirtation with mainstream pop on the Emotions album in 1967, they embraced psychedelia, producing the groundbreaking concept album S.F. Sorrow during 1967-68. This album, released in late 1968, is arguably one of the first rock operas, preceding The Who's Tommy by about a year. It was recorded in the legendary Abbey Road Studios six months after The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and Pink Floyd's The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. Each album shares a similar forward-thinking late-1960s psychedelic sound (as well as sharing the same record producer, Norman Smith, as the Floyd). S.F. Sorrow was followed by the highly-acclaimed record album Parachute, which continued the psychedelic sound and was named \"Album of the Year\" in 1970 by Rolling Stone Magazine. During this period they also recorded an album for a young French millionaire, Philippe DeBarge, which was intended only to be circulated among the man's social circle. The acetate has since been bootlegged.\n\nLater career\n\nFrom this point on, the group enjoyed less in the way of commercial success, but the devotion of a strong cult following, especially with critics and other rock musicians. Their material in the early 1970s tended towards more the hard rock and early heavy metal end of the spectrum, although still blues-based, on albums like Silk Torpedo. 1980's Cross Talk saw them incorporating influences of punk and New Wave into their hard rock sound; like most of their records, it was an artistic but not a commercial success.\n\nWith a new manager, Mark St John, they gigged sporadically during the 1980s. By the end of the decade their profile had almost disappeared, when founder members Phil May and Dick Taylor reformed the band for a successful European blues tour in late 1990 with Stan Webb's Chicken Shack and Luther Allison. This gigging outfit included drummer Hans Waterman (formerly of Dutch rock group Solution), bassist Roelf ter Velt and guitarist/keyboardist Barkley McKay (Waco Brothers and Pine Valley Cosmonaut's with Jon Langford of Mekon Fame). This line up regularly toured the European mainland playing a revitalised set that show cased their earlier, rootsy blues and r'n'b materiel, until late 1994. By 1995, they reformed the Cross Talk line-up and added Frank Holland on guitar in place of Peter Tolson. Their label, Snapper Music, issued remastered CDs with many bonus tracks, plus a DVD of a re-recording of S.F. Sorrow at Abbey Road Studios (with Dave Gilmour & Arthur Brown guesting). They toured more frequently, including a tour of the U.S. for the first time in decades\n\nOriginal rhythm guitarist Brian Pendleton died of lung cancer on May 16, 2001.\n\nIn the early 2000's, they released new recordings, including a live album and the studio album Rage Before Beauty.\n\nIn 2003, Alan Lakey's biography of the band, Growing Old Disgracefully, was published by Firefly. The book dealt with the long and involved history of the band, and paid special attention to the legal proceedings issued against EMI in the 1990s.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Pretty+Things\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Beneath the party up persona, you&#39;ll find the persistent passion of a college football linebacker, the drive of a NASCAR crew member and ultimately the level-headed, hard working values that are the result of a close family unit (and a mom that whipped him into shape). &quot;That guy you see on stage having the time of his life is the same guy you get behind the scenes. Some artists turn on a switch and you&#39;re like &#39;where did that come from?&#39; but for me --- this is it. I&#39;m a ball cap and t-shirt guy to the core. We&#39;ll roll out some songs and I may even join you for a few when we&#39;re wrapped and ready to head out.&quot; It&#39;s hard to believe that at such a young age, Chase truly has encountered all of the life experience mentioned above. While he had Garth blasting from his radio at an early age, he never thought about picking up the guitar until after an injury took him off the field at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. &quot;I started playing guitar and I&#39;ll never forget a piece of advice from my dad. He said &#39;boy anyone can play guitar, but no one is gonna really listen to you until you start singing.&#39;&quot; Those words would be the first turn on a new course for Chase, but his journey to the stage would take a few more turns (especially a lot of left ones). After graduation, Chase tackled a scene that many race fans only dream of by securing a spot on the celebrated Hendrick Motorsports pit crew. While NASCAR served as his day job, he spent his nights either writing songs or going to small bars around Charlotte and playing live. He would also spend any free weekends he had flying to Nashville to perform in writer&#39;s rounds and continuing to build his knowledge of the music scene. While honing his songwriting skills, this performer with an unwavering competitive spirit landed a slot on the hit TV show Survivor. Viewers tuned in each week to see the southern bred relentless participant blaze through each challenge taking him through to the final episode. The program would serve as a spring board bringing Chase to his current home in Music City where he continues to pierce through the sea of rising acts and stake career benchmarks within the industry. &quot;We had a great introduction with the EP Country As Me last year and the video for &#39;Buzz Back,&#39; so I expect Dirt Road Communion will continue to validate my grassroots approach. As my belt buckle beckons, &#39;Cowboy Up!&#39; and just enjoy the ride.&quot; Dirt Road Communion marks the first full length project for Chase serving up his concoction of contemporary country spiked with shots of rocking guitars, explosive crescendos, hands in the air grooves and lyrical content that swings like a pendulum from loud and fun to dark and vulnerable. When his isn&#39;t on stage opening up for acts like Jake Owen, Sara Evans, Lee Brice or Corey Smith, you&#39;ll find him penning tomorrow&#39;s hits with his songwriting circle that continues to grow. Aside from the Carolina blue, Chase has no qualms about rocking some camo-green on hunting trips with his brothers tracking deer, quail, pheasant or turkey. Chase is also a phene for America&#39;s past times. This football and baseball fan, known for rocking his backwards Braves hat on more than one occasion, has delivered an indie project that is truly a grand slam for a new act lining him up to be a David Freese of the music scene and an MVP (Most Valuable Performer) to watch in 2012.", "img": null, "title": "Chase Rice", "url": "http://eventful.com/bloomington/events/chase-rice-/E0-001-109736819-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Bluebird Nightclub", "city": "Bloomington"}, {"date": "2018-01-18 20:00:00", "description": null, "img": null, "title": "Chase Rice", "url": "http://eventful.com/portland_me/events/chase-rice-/E0-001-109685230-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Aura", "city": "Portland"}, {"date": "2018-02-09 19:00:00", "description": null, "img": null, "title": "Chase Rice", "url": "http://tampa.eventful.com/events/chase-rice-/E0-001-104162762-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "The RITZ Ybor", "city": "Tampa"}, {"date": "2018-01-18 20:00:00", "description": null, "img": null, "title": "Chase Rice", "url": "http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/chase-rice-/E0-001-104162802-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Terminal 5", "city": "New York"}, {"date": "2018-02-01 19:30:00", "description": null, "img": null, "title": "Chase Rice", "url": "http://hamptonroads.eventful.com/events/chase-rice-/E0-001-104188029-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "The Norva", "city": "Norfolk"}, {"date": "2018-02-23 20:00:00", "description": null, "img": null, "title": "Chase Rice", "url": "http://grandrapids.eventful.com/events/chase-rice-/E0-001-109755684-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "20 Monroe Live", "city": "Grand Rapids"}, {"date": "2018-05-12 18:00:00", "description": null, "img": null, "title": "Chase Rice", "url": "http://richmond.eventful.com/events/chase-rice-/E0-001-110658455-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Innsbrook After Hours", "city": "Glen Allen"}, {"date": "2018-01-24 00:00:00", "description": " \n", "img": null, "title": "Chase Bryant & Chase Rice", "url": "http://cincinnati.eventful.com/events/chase-bryant-chase-rice-/E0-001-110270917-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Miami Valley Gaming", "city": "Middletown"}, {"date": "2018-02-10 20:00:00", "description": null, "img": null, "title": "Chase Rice - Lambs & Lions Tour", "url": "http://atlanta.eventful.com/events/chase-rice-lambs-lions-tour-/E0-001-104157103-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "The Buckhead Theatre", "city": "Atlanta"}], "description": "Chase Rice (1985) is an American country music singer and songwriter. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chase+Rice\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Ever-stretching into more challenging and colorful ways to flex his musical chops, Hargrove has left indelible imprints in a vast array of artful settings. During his tenure on the Verve label alone, he has recorded an album with a hand-picked collection of the world&#39;s greatest tenor saxophonists (With the Tenors of Our Time), an album of standards with strings (Moment to Moment) and, in 2003, introduced his own hip hop/jazz collective The RH Factor with the groundbreaking CD Hard Groove (swiftly followed by the limited edition EP, Strength). Hargrove has also won Grammy\u00ae Awards for two vastly different projects. In 1997, Roy&#39;s Cuban-based band Crisol (including piano legend Jesus &quot;Chucho&quot; Valdes and wonder drummer Horatio &quot;El Negro&quot; Hernandez) won the Best Latin Jazz Performance Grammy for the album Habana. And in 2002, Hargrove, Herbie Hancock and Michael Brecker won Best Instrumental Jazz Album, Individual or Group, for their three-way collaboration Directions in Music. <br><br><br><br>Roy Hargrove was born in Waco, TX on October 16, 1969. Inspired by the gospel music he heard in church on Sundays and the R&B and funk music that played on the radio, Roy began learning the trumpet in the fourth grade. By junior high school, he was playing at an advanced level of proficiency. At 16, he was studying music at Dallas&#39;s prestigious Booker T. Washington School for the Visual and Performing Arts. <br><br><br><br>Midway through his junior year, Roy was &quot;discovered&quot; by Wynton Marsalis, who was conducting a jazz clinic at the school. Impressed, Marsalis invited Roy to sit in with his band at Ft. Worth&#39;s Caravan of Dreams Performing Arts Center. Subsequently, Hargrove was able to return to the venue over a period of the next three months, sitting in with Dizzy Gillespie, Herbie Hancock, Freddie Hubbard and Bobby Hutcherson. Word of Roy&#39;s talent reached Paul Ackett, founder and Director of The North Sea Jazz Festival who arranged for him to perform there that summer. This lead to a month long European Tour. <br><br>Hargrove spent one year (1988-1989) studying at Boston&#39;s Berklee School of Music, but could more often be found in NYC jam sessions, which resulted in his transferring to New York&#39;s New School. His first recording in NYC was with saxophonist Bobby Watson, followed shortly by a session with up-and-coming super group Superblue, featuring Watson, Mulgrew Miller and Kenny Washington. In 1990, he released his solo debut, Diamond in the Rough, on the Novus/RCA label, for which he would record a total of four albums that document his incubational growth as a &quot;young lion&quot; to watch. Hargrove made his Verve Records debut in 1994 on With the Tenors of Our Time, showcasing him with stellar sax men Joe Henderson, Stanley Turrentine, Johnny Griffin, Joshua Redman and Branford Marsalis. <br><br>Every album Roy has released on Verve has been different from the one preceding it. And the same can be said of the array of talents who have invited him to grace the stage and/or their recordings - from jazz legends Sonny Rollins and Jackie McLean to song stylists Natalie Cole, Diana Kralland Abbey Lincoln. From pop veterans Diana Ross, Steve Tyrell and Kenny Rankin to younger stars John Mayer and Rhian Benson to the cr*me de la cr*me of jazz divas: Carmen McRae and the late, great Shirley Horn. Hargrove was also commissioned by the Lincoln Jazz Center to compose the piece &quot;The Love Suite: In Mahogany,&quot; which was performed in 1993. He is also a superstar of the international touring scene with his quintet, RH Factor and as a soloist. <br><br>Touching back on the statement Roy made at the outset about the state of jazz and jazz audiences today, the music world would be hard pressed to find another ambassador capable of traversing the worlds of straight ahead swingin&#39; and the funky underground better than Brother Hargrove. The RH Factor&#39;s Distractions and The Roy Hargrove Quintet&#39;s Nothing Serious stand as the actual proof.

While the list goes on, there&#39;s much more to this trumpet players credit than simply recording as a sideman on many of today&#39;s contemporary artists albums.\u00a0Willie Waldman was born July 5th, in Santa Ana, California, summer of 1965. Since Willie was three years old he&#39;s been infatuated with music, specifically one instrument, namely, the trumpet. For years he begged his mother for the prize until she finally purchased his first trumpet at the age of seven, with the exception that he would learn to play. Now living in Westville, In. (Just East of Chicago) Saturday mornings brought those lessons with Mr. Claude, Willies first music instructor. Soon thereafter Willie found himself in school and in his first large ensemble situation with the Chesterton High School Marching Band in Chesterton Indiana. The band had won many state and national marching band competitions that led to Willies eventual scholarship with Memphis State University. This is where Willie feels he received his first real training.\u00a0Beale Street is where the action is in Memphis, and Willies calling beckoned him to find work playing on the famous strip. He met living legends Herman Green, Calvin Newborn and Jimmie Ellis (Willies first actual paid gig) at Club Handy. Willie recalls, &quot;I would go there and sit in and they would have me playing John Coltrane songs. I was so horrible and lost. I remember Herman saying, If you want to keep coming and stinking up my stage you&#39;d better take some lessons! So I started taking lessons from Herman and slowly honed my skills.&quot;\u00a0Now a member of Herman Green & the Green Machine (The Memphis Giant that produced such greats as James Williams, Mulgrew Miller, Kirk Whalum and others) Willie was playing five plus nights a week. As Willie and Herman became better friends they decided to try playing their music with a different approach in hopes of reaching a younger audience. Something with more of a rock/fusion flavor. Their conception and direction led to the 1987 formation of Freeworld. Freeworld became an educational breeding ground for many of Willies life long friends and fellow musicians and the group toured with huge name acts like Stevie Ray Vaughn, The Robert Cray Band, Albert King and Joe Cocker.\u00a0After several years of playing and touring with Freeworld, Willies drive brought him to California in 1994 to meet up with friend and engineer David Aron. At the time, Dave was working with Death Row Studios mixing and recording Snoop Dog&#39;s latest release and Snoop wanted to polish the disc with a brass touch. Willie was in the City of Angels less than one week and was already recording with Raps biggest superstar! He went on to record with Tupac Shakur, The Dogg Pound, Dazz & Kurupt, K Ci & Jo Jo, Exhibit and Nate Dogg. Although the situation was different, the experience and musical level was never the less very much the same. It proved valuable as well because this eventually led to session work on studio soundtracks such as Tombstone, Under Seige 2 and 101 Dalmations and also many commercials.\u00a0In 1997 Willie met Perry Farrell of Janes Addiction. Willie states, &quot;Perry opened the door to the whole alternative rock scene for me. I did horn parts for Perry&#39;s project Gobalee using the original Earth, Wind & Fire horn section and went on to meet Janes Addiction drummer Stephen Perkins.&quot; A Waldman and Perkin&#39;s friendship ensued and Willie played, wrote and co-produced the second Banyan recording Anytime at All including some of Willie&#39;s original Memphis crew Clint Wagner and Ross Rice. Working with Clint and Ross also brought Willie yet another musical connection with the introduction of Rob Wasserman of the Grateful Dead. Wille recorded on Wasserman&#39;s Space Island project and Willie was once again, an integral part of the project, writing, playing and co producing.\u00a0Willies first album, The Willie Waldman Project was recorded largely in the summer of 2000. Produced and engineered by Dave Aaron, Willie has brought an array of talent to the table showcasing the musicianship of: Daniel Shulman (Garbage), John Molo (Mickey Hart/Phil Lesh), Tony Franklin (The Firm/Jimmy Page), Greg Kurstin (Sheryl Crow/Red Hot Chili Peppers) and Stephen Perkins (Janes Addiction/Banyan/Methods of Mayhem). An all original album, Willies thoughts are that this recording encompasses the roots of Memphis and the freeform of L.A. bringing an eclectic, jam oriented jazz album that will definitely knock your socks off! Twelve tunes strong, dip into the light Latin tinged Spanish Nights and the Acid feel of Surfin&#39; Dog and Happy Days to start. You&#39;ll hear a definite Miles touch on Magic of Bear and Ursa Major while the back-beat of Rise Rise will make you want to shake your Memphis tail-feather! If avant-garde is your bag than it&#39;s here as well. Take a trip on the Cygnus X1. Rounding out the project are the percussive &quot;7 8&quot; and &quot;6 8&quot; with just enough electric piano and Latin bump/funk to make any fan hussle.\u00a0\u00a0A testament to his style, experience and roots, Willie Waldman has arrived and the proof is here in the Willie Waldman Project. Simply said, Willie Waldman will be the &quot;next big name&quot; years and bios apart from today&#39;s first project and you&#39;ll still see his name on credits everywhere!

Mulgrew was constantly meddling in jazz piano, and established a trio in high school that would play cocktail parties. Miller admits that they didn't really know what they were doing and were merely \"approaching jazz\". Miller is said to have set his mind definitely to becoming a jazz pianist after seeing Oscar Peterson (a first for Mulgrew) on television. \u201cIt was a life changing event. I knew right then that I would be a jazz pianist\u201d.\n\nMulgrew did indeed become a jazz pianist, and has adopted more from Peterson than his profession. Much of Mulgrew's playing has the same technical prowess so often connected with Peterson. Currently, Mulgrew maintains a working trio with Ivan Taylor on bass, and Rodney Green on drums.

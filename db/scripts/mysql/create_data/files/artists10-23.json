We will discuss the properties of cacao while consuming a strong, spiced and sweetened drink of pure raw cacao from Guatemala. Isabel and Ari will be guiding the group through a journey using meditation, music, and powerful breath to open our hearts and clear our minds. The journey will close with a sound healing. Theobroma Cacao (translated=Food of the Gods) contains many beneficial health properties and has been used as a food for millennia and ceremonially by Mesoamerican cultures. It was once comparable to gold, used in trade and ceremonially to document life-milestones. When you consume cacao prepared for ceremony using high quality raw cacao beans, the mood enhancing neurochemicals in cacao become particularly active. There is increased blood flow and oxygen to the brain, heart and skin, the whole body is nourished, awareness and focus is heightened and sensations are intensified. This promotes deep relaxation and often space for emotional release. People often report a deep sense of joy and peace, a connection to the oneness as well as insights of limiting behaviors, thoughts and feelings that are able to be understood and released within the safe space of ceremony. Cacao contains the neurotransmitters serotonin, tryptophan and dopamine which assist with feelings of well-being, combat stress and anxiety and contribute to motivation. It also contains the neuromodulator phenylethylamine (PEA) which helps the body create feelings of excitement and euphoria. Cacao is one if the highest sources of anti-oxidants (specifically Flavonoids) and magnesium, and extremely beneficial to heart health and reducing blood pressure. Please wear comfortable clothing, you are welcome to bring a yoga mat and cushion. There will be some provided too. A blindfold can also be beneficial. If you are experiencing serious health challenges or are on high levels of anti-depressants, please contact us to discuss if this type of journey is safe for you.

If you have any concerns or serious health issues, it\u2019s important to disclose these prior to treatment to ensure that Kambo is suitable and safe for you to work with.\u00a0As an IAKP Kambo Practitioner abiding by the Code of Ethics and Professional Practice, confidentiality is taken seriously. Your personal and private information will not be disclosed to any third party without your consent, unless required by due process of the law.---CAUTIONS & CONSIDERATIONSExtra caution is required in the following cases. It&#39;s important to disclose any of these prior to treatment:- People taking slimming, serotonin and/or sleeping supplements.- People taking immune-suppressants for auto-immune disorders.- People with active drug or alcohol addictions.- People who have been fasting/water-fasting for 7 days Before (or After) Kambo.- People who have had enemas, colonics, liver flushes or any water based detox 3 days Before (or After) taking Kambo.It&#39;s also important to disclose any of the following prior to treatment:- If you&#39;re taking or have recently stopped taking any medications.- If you&#39;re taking or have recently stopped taking any diet/slimming pills.- If you&#39;re regularly taking anti-diuretic medication or sports drinks.- If you have ever been, or are currently bulimic or anorexic.- If you&#39;re epileptic.- If you have abnormally high or low blood pressure.- If you have liver or kidney problems.- If you have any chronic or serious health issues.- If you have asthma.- If you have diabetes.It&#39;s helpful to note that if you&#39;re menstruating at the time of your treatment, Kambo will most likely cause your flow to increase for 24 to 36 hours, due to it&#39;s vasodilation properties.---PREPARING FOR A KAMBO TREATMENT- Do not attempt any sort of water or dry fast 7 days before/after Kambo.- Do not begin any colonics, enemas, water based detox, liver flushes or sweat lodge 3 days before/after Kambo.- Do not take recreational drugs or drink alcohol 24-48 hours before/after Kambo.- Do not eat any food 12 hours before Kambo. It&#39;s important to fast for these 12 hours immediately prior to a Kambo treatment.- Do not drink coffee on the morning of your treatment.- Do not drink large amounts of water or fluid on the morning of your Kambo treatment.\u00a0- You can drink a hot tea on the morning of your Kambo treatment, and sip on small amounts of water. Do not add honey. This can disturb your electrolyte balance.- Stop all fluid intake 2 hours prior to your Kambo treatment.(You will be required to drink 1.5-2L of water 10-15 minutes immediately before your Kambo is applied, as part of the purging process. This is why it&#39;s important to avoid drinking excessive water beforehand, to avoid electrolyte imbalance, potentially lead to hyponatremia - dangerously low sodium levels)- Wear loose, comfortable clothing on the day of your Kambo treatment. Layers are always good, due to the potential flux in body temperature.- Remove tight, restrictive jewellery before your Kambo treatment, due to the potential swelling of body parts.- Try to make little to no plans for the remainder of your day after your treatment. You may need to rest and recuperate.If you are unsure about any of the preparation protocols, or have questions or concerns, please get in touch and ask prior to ceremony.---WHAT DO I BRING TO A KAMBO CEREMONY?- Loose, comfortable, non-restrictive clothing.

The gothic-octogenous doom melted together with hard rock and psychedelic elements of theirs is a good example proving the fact that the frightening sound evoking the seventies can not be so ultimately captivating only by the Ghost witchcraft.<br> <br><strong>DOOL (NL)</strong><br><p> After the dissolution of The Devil&#39;s Blood, the Dutch underground searched for the moonlight of the orchestra for the occult and organically sounding fresh sounds. This is how the A38 Ship was organized earlier in the Gozsdu Man\u00f3 Club, the death rock / post-punk band, GOLD, and DOLD, which was also a capitalist, could be formed by bass guitarist Job and drummer Micha&#39;s joint initiative. However, he could hardly have suspected that such a high visibility would be deserved so fast in the international vintage palette of the female doom. Blood Ceremony, fans of Jess and the Ancient Ones, or Blood Ceremony, have already begun a new favorite at the first video sharing of Prophecy Records, and DOOL&#39;s international march has been unbroken since then. The Here Now, Here Then song, released on the German Metal Hammer Awards, combines the hard rock of the seventies and King&#39;s X with both progressive and psychedelic traces of the 1970s with The Sisters of Mercy&#39;s Gothic Atmosphere and the Occult Doom&#39;s Conjecture so that its tone can only be realized in real life.

After a mind-numbing study of hundreds of trashy witchcraft films, the group began to pour their energies into crafting songs, transforming their fascination for horror into a profane musical vision. \n\nTheir sound bears witness to the heavy bands of yesteryear, fusing progressive rock elements with folk and an early '70s downer vibe. Invoking the mischievous Pipes of Pan, Blood Ceremony songs are distinguished by singer Alia O'Brien's flute solos - accenting an instrument long-associated with a list of devilish figures. \n\nA celebration of Euro-horror, '60s saturnalia and occult miscellanea, their self-titled debut was mixed by Billy Anderson and released by Rise Above in 2008 to enthusiastic reviews. In 2009, Blood Ceremony completed a successful European tour supporting doom legends Electric Wizard. \n\nLiving With The Ancients, Blood Ceremony's sophomore album, expands the group's dark and regal sound with a heavy dose of vintage organ, gritty guitars and stirring flute harmonies. The album was recorded in Chicago by Sanford Parker, who completed the final mixes on Samhain Day. With \"Living With the Ancients,\" Blood Ceremony continues its journey through the mire of ancient occultism and flute-infused downer rock. The album was released on March 1, 2011. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Blood+Ceremony\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They formed in December 2004 with Evan Pharmakis and Nick Lambert and recorded their first demo in a dorm room at MassArt using a drum Machine. Soon they recruited drummer Brandon Davis (who at the time was playing guitar for the band Therefore I Am), bassist Shawn Marquis, and vocalist Joe Bragel.\n\nThey then recorded and self released their first EP, This Will Be Our Little Secret.  The six song EP quickly helped the band gain a strong local fan base. It was this EP that helped them get noticed and on November 15, 2005, the band was signed to Epitaph Records. In March 2006, they released a split vinyl EP with Therefore I Am; only 500 copies were pressed.\n\nThey then began recording their Epitaph debut, but due to personal reasons Vanna and vocalist Joe Bragel decided to part ways. After the departure of Joe, they recruited Chris Preece to fill in the vocal spot. For various legal reasons Chris could not do the vocal parts, so Nick and Evan did the vocals on the record. The The Search Party Never Came EP was released June 6, 2006. After its release, the band toured for the whole summer and into the fall and on October 25th, they traveled to Seattle, Washington to record their first full length album with Producer Matt Bayles (Mastodon, Norma Jean, The Fall Of Troy, Pearl Jam). They recorded through November and up until December 19. After coming home they took the month of January off and in February began touring again with The Esoteric and playing a few Dates on the 2007 Epitaph Tour.\n\nOn January 23rd, 2007, the song The Things He Carried was released on Purevolume and featured vocals from Brendan Brown of The Receiving End Of Sirens. Their debut full-length, Curses, was released on April 24, 2007 under Epitaph.  Midway through their tour to support the album, drummer Brandon Davis left for personal reasons, stating that there was no bad blood between him and the band. He was eventually replaced by Chris Campbell, formerly of The Jonah Veil and Evertone. \n\nAfter months of touring, the band went into the studio to record their 2009 full length, A New Hope. A few months after its release in April, vocalist Chris Preece decided to part ways with the band due to personal reasons. He played his last show with the band during Warped Tour in Mansfield, MA, where he gave the mic to new vocalist, Davey Muise (formerly of Seeker Destroyer).\n\nA year and a half later, Vanna released The Honest Hearts EP under Artery Recordings on October 12, 2010. The EP included three new songs as well as re-recorded versions of A Dead Language for a Dying Lady (shortened to A Dead Language) and Trashmouth. Three months later, they headed back to the studio to record a new full-length, And They Came Baring Bones, with producer Matt Goldman. The album was released on June 21, 2011.\n\nVanna are currently on the road for the European Impericon Never Say Die! Tour 2011 which will last throughout the month of October with fellow bands Suicide Silence, Emmure, Deez Nuts, The Word Alive, As Blood Runs Black, and The Human Abstract. They are also preparing for their first DVD, Bring Me Your Bones, by holding a show which will take place on November 12, 2011 at the Worcester Palladium in Massachusetts. At the same time, they will also be touring throughout the US from early November to mid-December with fellow bands The Chariot, The Crimson Armada, Former Thieves, and Listener. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Vanna\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

ABOUT THE TOUR: The Symbionese Liberation Army, an alleged left wing radical group, kidnapped newspaper heiress Patty Hearst in Berkeley in February 1974. Three months later in South Los Angeles, the kidnappers engaged almost 500 law officers in a standoff that was broadcast on national TV, culminating in a shootout and fire in which six members of the group were killed. In this special bus adventure, originally presented as part of Esotouric\u2019s tenth anniversary celebrations, author Brad Schreiber (&quot;Revolution\u2019s End&quot;) takes us to four significant SLA locations, revealing the incredible, true story of prison drug experiments, gun-running, undercover agents and the suppressed lover\u2019s quarrel that resulted in the most famous kidnapping in US history. It\u2019s a story that has waited forty years to be fully told, and which will unfold on and off the bus as we explore the radical culture of 1960s and 1970s South Los Angeles and beyond. Also joining us on this edition of the tour is another favorite Esotouric and forensic science seminar guest host, Mike Digby. For his contribution to the tour, Mike will provide a detective\u2019s interpretation of the LAPD\u2019s pursuit of the SLA, both leading up to the February 1974 standoff, and in the fractured group\u2019s continued terror campaigns that followed that event. Please note that this is a Special Event, and vouchers and discounts good on our regularly scheduled bus adventures are not accepted for this tour.

Based in The Bronx borough of New York City, the members of Terror Squad collectively debuted on a song in member Fat Joe's album Don Cartagena. Terror Squad released its eponymous debut, The Album, in 1999, with its first major hit \"Whatcha Gon' Do\", credited mostly to Big Pun, who died of a heart attack in 2000. After Big Pun's death, his longtime partners Cuban Link and Triple Seis left the group and were subsequently replaced by Remy Martin (later known as Remy Ma) and Tony Sunshine.\n\nIn 1998, the members of Terror Squad debuted as a group on Fat Joe's album Don Cartagena. Terror Squad in its debut album Terror Squad: The Album consisted of rappers Fat Joe, Big Pun, Cuban Link, Prospect, Armageddon, and Triple Seis. \n\nAs the group was on hiatus following Pun's death, most of its former members fell into obscurity, with Fat Joe having the most successful solo career among all the former members.\n\nThe group reunited and released their second album, True Story, in 2004. It included the summer club hit \"Lean Back,\" produced by Scott Storch, which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and 24 in the UK. A remix to \"Lean Back\" featured Lil Jon, Mase and Eminem was released on Fat Joe's 2005 album All or Nothing. Although the album failed to spawn other hit singles, Fat Joe and Remy, who contributed the vocals to \"Lean Back\", went on to release high-selling solo albums in 2006.  Fat Joe commented in a 2006 interview that Armageddon and Prospect had become lazy. Terror Squad signed to Koch Records in 2007. Apart from the three new members, DJ Khaled and Cool & Dre are retained as regular crew along with Tony Sunshine.\n\n\n2) Japanese TERROR SQUAD(sonicriot & Lord of nightmare) began playing in our earliest incarnation in 1992, covering our favorite hardcore, punk, and metal songs. writing songs and recording demos, the band slowly started to progress. \n\nAs the member changing on countless occasions. \nFrankensteiner(a.k.a JOKER) that beats of aggressive rhythm joins in 1996.\nThe album was recorded like an absent bassist, and the guitarist \"Lord of nightmare\" is playing the bass in the 1st Full length album. \nAnd, 1st Full Length album \"The wild stream of eternal sin\" in 1999 was released from the worldchaos production.\n\nbrutal bass player \"Anarchy beast\" joined in 2000\nAt the same time, \"Deadringer\" came to go with the band as a film staff. \nAfter that, the band digested a lot of Show, and worked hard at the tune making with steady steps. \n1st album released in 1999 records 10,000 sales all over the world. \n\nAnd, time passes, and the recording of 2nd album started in the summer of 2005. \nAnd, the 2nd album long-awaited \"Chaosdragon rising\" was released in May 2006. \n\nThe artwork formally received \"Lunatc woe(a.k.a.Hesomoge)\" that was the relation since the demo tape age as a member. \nIt opposed the sound of \"TERROR SQUAD\", and a wonderful art that constructed a new outlook on the world was shown. \nAnd, DEADRINGER was formally embraced from this album as a member. \n\nTERROR SQUAD official website <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Terror+Squad\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

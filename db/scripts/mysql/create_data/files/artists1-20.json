It was written by Tawanna Dabney, Michael Jackson, and StarGate. The song was released as the album's fourth single on September 7, 2007 worldwide. \"Don't Stop the Music\" is a dance-pop and techno song that features various rhythmic devices used mainly in hip hop music. The song samples the line, \"Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa\" which is taken from Jackson's 1983 single \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\". For using the line, both Rihanna and Jackson faced a lawsuit from the Cameroonian musician Manu Dibango, who claimed that the hook originates from his 1972 song \"Soul Makossa\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Don%27t+Stop+the+Music\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is written by Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Ester Dean, Makeba Riddick, Rob Swire and Rihanna herself and produced by Stargate. It is co-produced by Rob Swire. The single has reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, making \"Rude Boy\" her first No. 1 hit from Rated R, her 6th as a recording artist & 5th as a solo artist as of March 2010.\n\n\" When we wrote the song it was kind of a free-style. But I liked the West (Indies) influence that the music had. I just went in the booth and they were already jotting down some ideas and that (the hook) came to me. The hook \"rude boy\" was just supposed to be the intro. But it was so catchy we that we just made it the hook. \"\n\nRihanna has also told Q magazine the song is \"about the kind of street, bad boy that girls sometimes like.\"\n\nThe video was directed by music video director Melina Matsoukas in January 2010 in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California and was shot in a greenscreen. Matsoukas previously directed Rihanna's \"Hard\" music video. Rihanna said that the video is completely different from any other video she's shot before, describing it as \"pretty freakin' cool\". She added: \"A lot of my videos are really dark and edgy and tough. 'Rude Boy' is more playing along the lines from my roots. We used a lot of color, but also the costumes were very Jamaican dance-hall queen type\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Rude+Boy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was produced by Brian Kennedy with background vocals by Chris Brown and Andre Merritt. Contrary to popular belief, Rihanna uses an Auto-Tune, not a vocoder throughout the song. It was featured in a Circuit City commercial.\n\nThe song was originally written by Chris Brown and his team known as the Graffiti Artizts and was considered for the re-release of his album Exclusive. However, Brown felt that the song would be better suited for a female singer. He then forwarded the song to Rihanna. Def Jam had considered saving the track for Rihanna's next album in 2009, because she had already recorded \"Take a Bow\" for the re-release of Good Girl Gone Bad. However, Rihanna and her team felt that the song was a summer single and needed to be recorded and released as soon as possible. The decision was finally made to release the song as the follow up to \"Take a Bow\".\n\nThe song follows in the footsteps of Rihanna's \"Don't Stop the Music\" by being a fast and upbeat pop/dance-rhythmic song. However, in contrast to the upbeat music of \"Don't Stop the Music\", it is lyrically dark in tone, being about a state of mental anguish, delusional feelings and confusion.\n\nIn the UK, although not yet released as a single, \"Disturbia\" debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number forty-seven and was expected to chart higher on the 27th July due to high downloads and the release of the video, but managed to re-enter at #47 again and then climbed to #34. It also debuted at number forty-five in Ireland and then rose to #7 and became its new peak. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Disturbia\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

After she turned down several attempts by the Scottish electro wiz, she finally agreed to record this track. \n\nWe Found Love features Scottish singer-songwriter Calvin Harris it is a dance-pop and electropop song, with elements of other musical genres, including dubstep and electro house. Released in September 2011.\n\nIt reached number one in its sixth week on the BillboardHot100, giving Rihanna the record for a solo artist to have amassed twenty top-ten singles in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 in the shortest amount of time and Harris his first number-one single. With the song becoming the singer's eleventh number one single, Rihanna has become only the seventh artist in the 53 year history of the chart to amass at least eleven number one singles, as well as tying her with Whitney Houston in third place for females with the most number one singles, behind only Madonna (12) and Mariah Carey (18). The song has also peaked at 1 on both US Hot Dance Club Songs and Pop Songs charts. Elsewhere, \"We Found Love\" peaked at number one in New Zealand, Denmark, France, Canada, Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, and has attained top-five positions in Australia, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and South Korea.\n\nThe song's accompanying music video was directed by Melina Matsoukas and presents Rihanna's relationship with her boyfriend as being like a drug and how their addiction to each other results in the singer leaving her boyfriend because of his possessive nature. The video received a mixed response from critics, and they noted that the video strongly alludes to ex-boyfriend Chris Brown's assault on Rihanna.  \n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/We+Found+Love+(feat.+Calvin+Harris)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Her song Umbrella was one of the highest-selling songs of 2007 and her 3rd album Good Girl Gone Bad was critically acclaimed, helping propel her to superstar status. She has attained fourteen Billboard Hot 100 number ones thus far and is the second Bajan artist to win a Grammy Award. She is also a cultural ambassador for Barbados.\n\nRihanna was born in Saint Michael, Barbados to Ronald Fenty, a warehouse supervisor, and Monica Fenty, an accountant.  Her mother, a native of Guyana, is Afro-Guyanese and her father is Bajan and Irish. She is the oldest of three siblings; two younger brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty.  She began singing at around the age of seven.  Her childhood was deeply affected by her father's addiction to crack cocaine and parent's rocky marriage, which ended when she was fourteen years old.  Rihanna attended Charles F. Broome Memorial School, a primary school in Barbados, and then the Combermere School, where she formed a musical trio with two of her classmates at the age of fifteen.  In 2004 she won the Miss Combermere Beauty Pageant.  She was an army cadet in a sub-military programme that trained with the military of Barbados and Shontelle was her drill sergeant.\n\nAt the age of 15, she formed a girl group with two of her classmates.  In 2003, friends introduced Rihanna and her two bandmates to record producer Evan Rogers, who was vacationing in Barbados with his wife.  The group auditioned for Rogers, who said that \"the minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didn't exist.\"   While auditioning for Rogers, Rihanna sang Destiny's Child's cover of \"Emotion\".  Over the next year, Rihanna and her mom shuttled back and forth to Rogers home in Stamford, Connecticut. Then, shortly after turning 16, she relocated in the United States and moved in with Rogers and his wife.  Carl Sturken helped Rihanna record a four-song demo, which included the ballad \"The Last Time,\" a cover of Whitney Houston\u2019s hit \"For the Love of You\" and what would become her first hit, \"Pon de Replay\" to send to various recording companies.  It took a year to record the demos, because she was going to school and would only record during summer and Christmas school breaks. Rihanna's demo made its way to Def Jam, which invited her to audition for the label's then-president, Jay-Z, who quickly signed her.\n\nRihanna broke into the recording industry in 2005 with the release of her debut album Music of the Sun, which features the number 2 hit single \"Pon de Replay\".  Less than a year later, Rihanna released A Girl Like Me and earned her first number-one single, \"SOS, which sampled the popular 80s track \"Tainted Love\".  \"Unfaithful\" was also released and was fairly successful.\n\nRihanna released her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad, in June 2007. Prior to the release of the album, she spent the week of the Grammys writing songs for the album with Ne-Yo.  She adopted a more sexual image while recording the album, eventually dying her hair black and cutting it short. Rihanna worked with Timbaland and Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart, as well as previous musical collaborators such as Stargate, Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers to re-imagine her album compositions with uptempo dance tracks. Rihanna commented, \"I want to keep people dancing but still be soulful at the same time.  You feel different every album, and [at] this stage I feel like I want to do a lot of uptempo [songs].\"\n\nThe album topped the charts in countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Brazil, Russia and Ireland, and peaked at number two in the United States and Australia.  Unlike previous work, the album featured a more dance-pop sound instead of the dancehall, reggae and ballad styles. The album received positive reviews by critics, becoming her most critically acclaimed album at that time compared to her previous efforts.\n\nIt yielded eight hit singles - \"Umbrella\"  \"Shut Up and Drive\", \"Don't Stop The Music\" \"Hate That I Love You\" \"Rehab\" \"Disturbia\" \"Take A Bow\" \"If I Never See Your Face Again\" - all singles reaching the top twenty on the Billboard Hot 100 \u2014 including the worldwide number-one hit \"Umbrella,\" featuring Jay-Z.  \n\nIn addition to reaching number one in various countries, \"Umbrella\" was the number one single in the United Kingdom for ten consecutive weeks, making it the longest-running number-one single since Wet Wet Wet's single \"Love Is All Around\" spent fifteen weeks at the top in 1994.  The song is listed number three on the 100 Best Songs of 2007 published by Rolling Stone magazine.  In 2008, \"Umbrella\" earned Rihanna and Jay-Z a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in addition to receiving nominations for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. It managed to stay at number one in the United Kingdom for 10 weeks, the longest time spent by a female and in the 21st century, on this chart.\n\n\"Umbrella\" has also been recognised in various forms of accolades by the music press. The song is listed number three on the 100 Best Songs of 2007, published by the music magazine Rolling Stone. Time magazine also listed the song number three on their Top 10 Songs of 2007. The song is listed number one on Entertainment Weekly magazine's list of the 10 Best Singles of 2007, while topping the magazine's poll for the best single of 2007. Blender magazine awarded the song Song of the Year in their Readers' Poll 2007. The music press has considered \"Umbrella\" as 2007's Song of the Summer,  while The New York Times writer Kelefa Sanneh regarded it as \"arguably 2007's signature slow jam\".\n\nIn August 2009, Rihanna collaborated with Jay-Z and Kanye West on \"Run This Town.\" The song peaked at number two on Billboard Hot 100 and also reached the top ten in five other countries. She appeared on the cover of Vogue Italia for the September 2009 Issue.  The shoot was influenced by Rihanna's hair, which she had cut for the shoot into a mohawk-like style. The style of the shoot was Extreme Couture and very dark, and in one shot she appeared semi-nude.  Rihanna performed \"Run This Town\" along with Jay-Z and West for the \"Answer the Call\" concert at Madison Square Garden in September 2009, making it her first musical performance since the altercation with Brown. The trio also performed \"Run This Town,\" on the premiere of The Jay Leno Show on September 14, 2009.\n\nIn November of 2009, \"Rated R\" was released in the wake of a physical altercation with romantic interest Chris Brown, who pled guilty to felony assault. The album's lead single, \"Russian Roulette\" -- written with Ne-Yo - was one of the year's most controversial singles. The album also includes collaborations with Tricky, The-Dream, Stargate, and SRP.\n\nOne year later, Rihanna released her fifth studio album called \"Loud'. It's lead single, \"Only Girl (In the World)\", reached number one in more than ten countries. The song also won a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording.\n\n\"Talk That Talk\" was released one year after \"Loud\". With the song \"We Found Love\", Rihanna became the fastest solo artist in the chart's history to achieve twenty Hot 100 top-ten singles, breaking the previous record set by Madonna. The song later became her eleventh number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. \"You Da One\" became the second single from the album but was not as successful as \"We Found Love\". The third single from the album, \"Talk That Talk\" featuring Jay-Z, was announced on Rihanna's Twitter. The fourth single, \"Where Have You Been\", peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\nOn February 20, 2012, Rihanna and Chris Brown released 2 remixes, one featuring the \"Talk That Talk\" album track \"Birthday Cake\" and the other featuring Chris Brown's \"Turn Up The Music\"\n\nIn April 2012, the singer appeared in the movie \"Battleship\", which is based on the game of the same name.\n\nRihanna's seventh album, Unapologetic was released on November 19, 2012; it was preceded by the lead single Diamonds, which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 becoming Rihanna's twelfth number one single on the chart and tying her with Madonna and The Supremes for the fourth-most number ones in the chart's history.\n\nOn January 28, 2016, Rihanna released her eighth studio album Anti exclusively through streaming service Tidal. The album peaked at number one on the US Billboard 200, becoming Rihanna's second number one and eighth top ten album on the chart. The album was supported by the release of four singles including the lead single \"Work\" featuring Drake, which topped the Billboard Hot 100. Further platinum singles \"Needed Me\" and \"Love on the Brain\" both peaked inside the top ten of the Hot 100. In 2016, Rihanna was featured on several singles. The first collaboration was Calvin Harris' \"This Is What You Came For,\" which reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two in the United Kingdom. Rihanna was also featured on Drake's \"Too Good\" from his album Views and Mike Will Made It's single, \"Nothing Is Promised\". On June 27, 2016, Rihanna released \"Sledgehammer\", the lead single from the Star Trek Beyond soundtrack. On August 28, Rihanna was honored with the MTV Video Vanguard Award at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was released on 8 March 2013, as the lead single from the EP. Lorde and Joel Little co-wrote and produced the song. Musically, \"Royals\" is a minimal and art pop song. Lyrically, it expresses the protagonist's disdain for the lavish lifestyles of music stars.\n\nUpon release \"Royals\" was met with acclaim, and won the 2013 APRA Silver Scroll award, New Zealand's top songwriting prize. Critics placed the track among the year's best. \"Royals\" reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. It also reached number one in Belgium, Ireland, Canada, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand, and was certified triple platinum by Recorded Music NZ. In August 2013, Lorde became the first female solo act to top the Billboard Alternative Songs chart since Tracy Bonham in 1996. \"Royals\" was the second ever track from a New Zealander to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2013 after \"Somebody That I Used To Know\", from Kimbra in collaboration with Australian-Belgian singer Gotye.\n\nJoel Kefali directed the music videos for \"Royals\", the first portrayed ordinary teenagers doing mundane things, in slow motion \u2013 an 'international version' followed, additionally featuring short Lorde appearances. The track has been remixed by artists including Rick Ross, The Weeknd, Gilbere Forte, and Pomplamoose.\n\n\"Lately I've been waking up at 4 or 5 a.m., turning things over in my head. So much to think about, so much to break down and process and decide. I'm only at the beginning, but it has always been important to me that everything feels cool, feels right. This song means a hell of a lot to me, and to others, and I guess what I tried to do is make something you could understand. A lot of people think teenagers live in this world like 'skins' every weekend or whatever, but truth is, half the time we aren't doing anything cooler than playing with lighters, or waiting at some shitty stop. That's why this had to be real. And I'm at that particular train station every week. Those boys are my friends.

Over those years, 2015 to 2017, Lorde became an adult and moved away from her \u201cglossy idiot god\u201d teenage self and \u201ccrossed over\u201d to adulthood. In a Facebook post on her 20th birthday, she described 2016 as a \u201ccolossal year.\u201d\n\nThe song was promoted heavily via the website imwaitingforit.com, which released teasers of the music video for the track for three days before it officially dropped. One day before the website\u2019s launch, the first teaser was aired as a commercial across New Zealand, Lorde\u2019s home country, and two days before the song dropped, she left clues around specific locations in Auckland, New Zealand, containing lyrics from the song and hints about its title. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lorde/_/Green+Light\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

And I think everyone knows what that\u2019s like, to just feel like a fucking liability.\u201d\n \nShe also explained: \u2039\u2039I\u2019m really proud of this bit of songwriting. I feel like I got somewhere they hadn\u2019t been before, which is always a nice feeling as a songwriter. It\u2019s interesting because I had this realization that because of my lifestyle and what I do for work there\u2019s going to be a point with every single person around me where I\u2019m gonna be attacks on them in some way. If it is having to give up a little portion of their privacy or their life becoming more difficult or whatever. It was just this moment of sadness and I remember it so vividly.\nI was in this cab alone listening to \u201cHigher\u201d by Rihanna because ANTI had just come out. And I had a little cry and I was just like, \u201cIt\u2019s always going to be this way, at some point with everyone it\u2019s going to be this way.\u201d But the song kind of ended up turning into a bit of a protective talismans for me. I was like, you know what, I\u2019m always gonna have myself so I have to really nurture this relationship and feel good about hanging out with myself and loving myself. And the tone of the melody, the way it kind of falls around, it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s kind of drunk or it sort of leans around, it\u2019s got this hip-hop cadence to it.\u203a\u203a\n\nIt follows Melodrama\u2019s \u201cGreen Light,\u201d which she co-wrote with Antonoff and Joel Little and co-produced with Antonoff and Frank Dukes. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lorde/_/Liability\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

She released her first EP, The Love Club EP, in March 2013 and her first single, \"Royals\", in June 2013. Her d\u00e9but album, Pure Heroine, was released on September 27, 2013.\n\nLorde was born in Auckland, New Zealand. Her father, an Irish-New Zealander, is a civil engineer, and her mother, Sonja Yelich, a Croatian-New Zealander, is a prize-winning poet. She was raised in Devonport, a suburb of Auckland.\n\nAt the age of 12, she was spotted by A&R scout Scott Maclachlan when he saw her singing in a video of a talent show at her school, Belmont Intermediate. Later, when Yelich-O'Connor was 13, Maclachlan signed her to Universal Music and, at the age of 14, she began working with their songwriters in 2012.\n\nOfficially released digitally in March 2013 and on CD in May 2013, The Love Club EP features five songs, including the number one hit \"Royals\". On May 27 2013, \"Royals\" was covered on national television on the New Zealand version of The X Factor by all-girl group Gap 5, mentored by Melanie Blatt of the All Saints. \"Royals\" d\u00e9buted as a single at number 1 on the New Zealand Top 40 on 15 March 2013 and remained in the top position for three weeks. In the U.S. it peaked at number 1 on the Hot 100 and number 1 on both the Alternative charts (making Lorde the first female artist since Tracy Bonham to reach the top) and number 1 on the Rock charts, making her the first female artist to top the charts as a lead singer.\n\nOn 8 May 2013, The Love Club EP d\u00e9buted in the number 2 position on the album chart. In August 2013, Lorde became the first woman to top the Billboard Alternative Songs chart in the United States since Tracy Bonham in 1996. Following the release of \"Royals\" in the United States in June 2013, 85,000 copies were sold during a single week in July. In a subsequent interview, Lorde stated, \"I had a sneaking suspicion that it might do all right\". In November 2013, her song \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" was included on the soundtrack of \"the movie \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\" along with tracks from Coldplay, Sia, The Weeknd, Christina Aguilera, Of Monsters and Men, and Imagine Dragons among others.\n\nThe \"Tennis Court\" single was released in New Zealand on 8 June 2013. The \"Tennis Court EP\" was released digitally in the UK on 7 June (due to the timezone difference) and physically on 22 June. It was played during the BBC Sport coverage of the 2013 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's Singles final. On 14 June 2013, Yelich-O'Connor's second single \"Tennis Court\" d\u00e9buted at number 1 on the New Zealand Top 40 singles chart. In the same week, she also became the first New Zealand artist to simultaneously have four songs in the top 20 tracks of the New Zealand Top 40. Previously, Titanium held this record with three songs.\n\n2014 - Major Awards continue \nLorde's success continued in 2014, picking up major awards at:\n- the 56th Grammy Awards - \"Song of The Year\" for \"Royals\" and also \"Best Pop Vocal Performance\" (Los Angeles, January 2014). \n- the BRIT Awards - International Female Solo Artist (London, February 2014).\n- the inaugural iHeartRadio Awards - Best New Artist (Los Angeles, May 2014). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lorde\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song\u2014which BBC Radio 2 later called \"a cross between a Broadway musical and a Salvador Dal\u00ed painting\"\u2014featured guest piano work by keyboardist Rick Wakeman. When released as a single in 1973, it reached #3 in the UK and stayed on the chart for thirteen weeks. The song re-entered the UK charts at #55 over 30 years later, largely because of its use in the original British television series Life on Mars. \nIn 1968, Bowie wrote \"Even a Fool Learns to Love\", a song with lyrics by Bowie set to the music of a 1967 French song (\"Comme d'habitude\"). Bowie's song was never released, but Paul Anka bought the rights to the original French version, and rewrote it into \"My Way,\" made famous by Frank Sinatra in a 1969 recording on his album of the same name. The success of the Anka version prompted Bowie to write \"Life on Mars?\" as a parody of Sinatra's recording.\nBBC Radio has described \"Life on Mars?\" as having \"one of the strangest lyrics ever\" consisting of a \"slew of surreal images\" like a Salvador Dal\u00ed painting. The line \"Look at those cavemen go\" is a reference to the song \"Alley Oop\", a one-off hit in 1960 for American doo-wop band The Hollywood Argyles.\nBowie, at the time of Hunky Dory's release in 1971, summed up the song as \"A sensitive young girl's reaction to the media\". In 1997 he added \"I think she finds herself disappointed with reality... that although she's living in the doldrums of reality, she's being told that there's a far greater life somewhere, and she's bitterly disappointed that she doesn't have access to it\".\nThe liner notes for Hunky Dory indicate that the song was 'inspired by Frankie'. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/_/Life+on+Mars%3F\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Produced by Bowie and Tony Visconti, it was released both as a single and as the title track of the album \"Heroes\". A product of Bowie's fertile 'Berlin' period, life in the city was crystallized into a tale of two lovers who come together in the shadow of the 'Wall of Shame' (though here \"the shame was on the other side\"). David Bowie was inspired by seeing his producer Tony Visconti (who was married at the time) kissing his mistress across from the studio which happened to be next to the Berlin Wall - the lyrics were composed as an ironic commentary on the situation, with the quotes in the title meant to emphasise the irony. While not a huge hit at the time, the song has gone on to become one of Bowie's signature tunes and is well known today for its appearance in numerous advertisements. It has been cited as Bowie's second most covered song after Rebel Rebel. The single version of this song is far shorter than the album version.\n\nAccording to the Heroes Songfacts, featured in this song are not only Brian Eno's synthesizer and Robert Fripp's guitar, but also producer Tony Visconti banging on a metal ashtray that was lying around the studio. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/_/%22Heroes%22\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It offers a promise of deliverance, that the human race has been redeemed by greater powers, with a chorus built for a crowd to sing it. It\u2019s the song that finally broke Bowie, whose performance of it on a July 1972 Top of the Pops made him a nationwide, and soon worldwide, pop star. So while the Ziggy-era Bowie is remembered today for his outrageousness, the song that made his name is warm, reassuring and most of all familiar.\n\nThe latter\u2019s key. For the average UK pop listener of 1972, David Bowie was still the weirdo who had had the song about Major Tom back in the \u201960s, and suddenly, here he was back again with another astronaut song. It finally connected. And \u201cStarman\u201d seems like a revision of \u201cSpace Oddity\u201d\u2014\u201dSpace Oddity\u201d had placed a frail human figure against the unfathomable expanse of space and cast him loose to drift into the unknown. It was submission to the void, the human race reaching its limits. In \u201cStarman\u201d the unknown is domesticated: the alien comes to visit us, in our homes, whispering through our radios, speaking softly, promising release. The stoicism of \u201cPlanet earth is blue/and there\u2019s nothing I can do\u201d is replaced by \u201che\u2019s told us not to blow it/\u2019cos he knows it\u2019s all worthwhile.\u201d The human race, or at least its children, turn out to be essential after all\u2014the earth, once again, is the center of the universe.\n\nVariations on this theme were common in the Seventies, from the popular Erich von D\u00e4niken theory that mysterious aliens had helped guide the progress of human civilization, to the benevolent star-children of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, to even Doctor Who, where in the early \u201970s the cosmos-traveling Doctor was exiled on present-day Earth and freelanced for the military.*\n\n\u201cStarman\u201d is also a pop song about pop music. Bowie\u2019s alien appears only as a voice on the radio (he\u2019s basically a cosmic DJ), whispering secrets to a teenager listening late at night\u2014it\u2019s how pop music can instantly create secret societies, break up the tedium of your life, liberate you from your parents. And \u201cStarman\u201d the track seems fused from a pile of old records. The octave-leap opening of the chorus is a lift from \u201cOver the Rainbow\u201d (so much that Bowie cheekily merged the two songs during a \u201972 concert at the Rainbow, linked to above), the guitar-keyboard hook linking the verse to the chorus is taken from the Supremes\u2019 \u201cYou Keep Me Hangin\u2019 On\u201d or The Five Americans\u2019 \u201cWestern Union\u201d (Nicholas Pegg suggests Blue Mink\u2019s \u201cMelting Pot\u201d), while the long \u201cLA-la-la-la-LA\u201d outro is pure T. Rex, particularly \u201cHot Love.\u201d It\u2019s a greatest-hits compilation in a four-minute song.\n\n\n\nFor all its familiarity, \u201cStarman\u201d begins ominously enough, opening with an eleventh chord and slowly moving through eight bars in which Bowie hums along to his acoustic guitar, all ringing open strings. This intro keeps listeners on edge, getting them to wonder just where the track\u2019s going, until a fill by Woody Woodmansey (just two toms and the snare) kicks off the verse. Bowie sings the two seven-bar verses softly, in a near-whisper in places, keeping to the middle of his range. He barbs a few vocal hooks (the four-note dips in the second and fourth bars (\u2018were low-oh-oh,\u201d \u201cdi-oh-oh-oh\u201d)), while a bar of fast acoustic strumming fills a gap.\n\nThe chorus starts with Bowie\u2019s octave leap (F to F), much like the chorus of \u201cLife On Mars,\u201d but listeners were prepared for the \u201cMars\u201d chorus via the build-up of its extravagant bridge. The \u201cStarman\u201d chorus just erupts after two bars of the \u201cHangin\u2019 On\u201d guitar-keys hook. Ronson\u2019s solo (which repeats in the long outro) is typically melodic and crafty. I\u2019ll let Jesse Gress, author of \u201c10 Things You Gotta Do to Play Like Mick Ronson,\u201d describe it: [it's] a perfect example of how to build a strong, memorable melodic line over a simple IV-I-V-I progression (Bb-F-C-F). The idea is to target the 3 of each chord on every downbeat and connect them with adjacent F major scale tones, while \u201cplaying\u201d the strategically placed rests and making the melody more guitar-y by adding bends and finger vibrato.\n\nAnd like \u201cHot Love\u201d or \u201cHey Jude,\u201d the song seems unwilling to stop, its outro extended for over a minute while Ronson throws in some additional lead playing and Bowie leads a chorus in a circle.\n\n\n\nAfter \u2018Starman,\u2019 everything changed.\n\nWoody Woodmansey, 2008.\n\nIn 1972 I\u2019d get girls on the bus saying to me, \u2018Eh la, you got a lippy on?\u2019 or \u2018Are you a boy or a girl?\u2019 Until [Bowie] turned up, it was a nightmare. All my mates at school would say, \u2018Did you see that bloke on Top of the Pops? He\u2019s a right faggot, him!\u2019 And I remember thinking \u2018you pillocks.\u2019\u2026With people like me, it helped forge an identity and a perspective on things, helped us to walk in a different way, metaphorically\u2026\n\nIan McCulloch, in David Buckley\u2019s Strange Fascination.\n\n\u201cStarman\u201d wasn\u2019t meant for Ziggy Stardust. Bowie went into the studio in early February \u201972 to cut the song as a single, but RCA\u2019s \u201ccontemporary music\u201d VP Dennis Katz loved \u201cStarman\u201d so much he mandated its inclusion on the LP (a sign that RCA\u2019s US operations were calling the shots, as American labels always had been baffled by the UK practice of keeping singles off the album). Released in April, \u201cStarman\u201d had a slow journey up the charts but thanks in part to Bowie\u2019s touring, it reached the top 10 by late June. Two television appearances by Bowie and the Spiders to support the single did the rest.\n\nThe first was Granada TV\u2019s Lift-Off With Ayshea on 15 June, but the one everyone remembers is the Top of the Pops performance, recorded on 5 July and broadcast the following day. For a generation of British teenagers, it was nothing short of the revolution, televised. Marc Riley, later of The Fall, recalled his grandmother shouting insults at the TV while Bowie performed (\u201csomething she usually saved for Labour Party broadcasts\u201d he told David Buckley). The 15-year-old Susan Ballion, soon to call herself Siouxsie Sioux, watched Bowie\u2019s Top of the Pops while in the hospital recovering from colitis; the 15-year-old Gary Numan watched it, stunned, in his East London living room; in Liverpool, the 13-year old Ian McCulloch stared at the TV and \u201cthought maybe I was Ziggy Stardust all along,\u201d as he told Marc Spitz.\n\nThe performance isn\u2019t just about Bowie, though he\u2019s striking with his copper-colored mullet, his leotard and his effortless charisma (twirling his finger at the camera while singing \u201cpicked on you-ooh-ooo\u201d, and connecting with every susceptible kid in the UK). The essential moment comes when Bowie starts to sing the first chorus and Ronson tentatively approaches the mike. Bowie notices him and sweeps his arm over Ronson\u2019s shoulder, pulls him to the mike. It\u2019s a sweet moment of inclusion, the alien embracing the rocker, and, by proxy, all of the nation\u2019s misfits. \u201cStarman\u201d left community in its wake; its promise came true.\n\n\u201cStarman\u201d was recorded on 4 February 1972 and released in April (RCA 2199) c/w \u201cSuffragette City.\u201d It hit #10. \u201cStarman\u201d wasn\u2019t a regular feature of the Ziggy tour; Bowie stopped playing it by the end of 1972 and there are some other signs (such as its odd exclusion from the greatest hits LP ChangesOneBowie) that Bowie didn\u2019t think much of it at the time. He wouldn\u2019t play \u201cStarman\u201d live again until his greatest-hits tour of 1990, though it became a standard in Bowie\u2019s early 2000s shows.\n\n* An indulgent, long footnote on Bowie and Doctor Who. Bowie\u2019s career has many parallels with the history of the UK\u2019s finest SF show (let alone the fact that Bowie\u2019s best chronicler, Nicholas Pegg, is a Dalek operator in his spare time). Bowie\u2019s recording career begins soon after the start of Who in  late 1963, and the odd psychedelia of his late \u201960s work is something akin to the whimsy of Patrick Troughton-era Who (cf. \u201cThe Laughing Gnome\u201d with \u201cThe Mind Robber\u201d). Bowie\u2019s glam era coincides with the Pertwee years (the back cover of Ziggy Stardust even has Bowie standing in a police box!) (well, no, this is a cock-up of a statement\u2014see comments), his most ambitious, influential work with the Tom Baker years (Low and the great Baker Season 14 are synchronous), Bowie\u2019s MTV-era reign with Peter Davison\u2019s.

A different version was recorded for US single release, featuring a funkier backing and looped backing vocals. Cited as his most-covered track, it was effectively Bowie's farewell to the glam movement that had made him a star.\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\nOriginally written for a mooted Ziggy Stardust musical in late 1973, \"Rebel Rebel\" was Bowie's last single in the glam rock style that had been his trademark. It was also his first hit since 1969 not to feature lead guitarist Mick Ronson; Bowie himself played guitar on this and almost all other tracks from Diamond Dogs, producing what NME critics Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray called \"a rocking dirty noise that owed as much to Keith Richards as it did to the departed Ronno\".\n\nThe song is notable for its gender-bending lyrics (\"You got your mother in a whirl / She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl\") as well as its distinctive riff, which rock journalist Kris Needs has described as \"a classic stick-in-the-head like the Stones' 'Satisfaction'\". Bowie himself later said, \"It's a fabulous riff! Just fabulous! When I stumbled onto it, it was 'Oh, thank you!'\"\n\nTranssexual rock artist and former Bowie associate Jayne County claims that \"Rebel Rebel\" was based in part on County's own song \"Queenage Baby\", which was recorded in January of 1974 by Bowie's Mainman Records, but not released at the time. The song later surfaced on the independent 2006 release Wayne County at the Trucks, and some critics, upon hearing the track, echoed County's claims.\n\nRelease and aftermath\n\nThe single quickly became a glam anthem, the female equivalent of Bowie's earlier hit for Mott the Hoople, \"All the Young Dudes\". It reached #5 in the UK and #64 in the USA. The latter release initially featured a different recording altogether. The single, credited to simply 'Bowie', is shorter (2:58) and more uptempo, dense and camp, featuring phased vocals and Bowie playing all of the instruments with the exception of Geoff MacCormack on congas. It was swiftly withdrawn and replaced by the UK single version, but the same arrangement was used on Bowie's North American tour in 1974, appearing on the concert album David Live.\n\nAfter retiring the song on the 1990 Sound and Vision tour, Bowie brought \"Rebel Rebel\" back for the 1999 'hours...' promotional tour. In 2003, a new version was recorded, featuring an arrangement by Mark Plati and without the reference to quaaludes present in the original. This was issued on a bonus disc that came with some versions of the Reality album the same year, and on the 30th Anniversary Edition of Diamond Dogs in 2004. Also in 2004, the track was blended in a mash-up with the Reality song \"Never Get Old\"; the result was issued as the single \"Rebel Never Gets Old\".\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/_/Rebel+Rebel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A rerecorded version was released in 1972 on the album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. Song's classic guitar solo, performed by Bowie's guitarist Mick Ronson, was ranked 85. on Guitar World's \"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\". \n\nStory: The alien messiah is revealed/created, and his destiny to save the world from the disaster in \"Five Years\" is also hinted at, as well his fate as the quintessential \"soul lover\". In terms of the plot, this is one of the most important songs as it describes the creation of Ziggy from a combination of religion, romance, sexual freedom, rebellion, and passion; he metamorphoses into the archetypal rock star.\n\nMoonage Daydream: The Life and Times of Ziggy Stardust is the title of a book written by David Bowie, published in 2002 by Genesis Publications, named after this song. The book documented the years 1972-73 and was fully illustrated with the photography of Mick Rock. David and Mick met in 1972 and formed a working relationship and lasting friendship. Subsequently, Mick Rock was allowed to become the only photographer authorised to record the 2-year career of Ziggy Stardust.\n\nThe Arnold Corns version of \"Moonage Daydream\" was released by B&C on single in the UK in April 1971. \"Hang on to Yourself\" was the B-side.\n[edit] Production credits\n\n    * Producer:\n          o David Bowie and Ken Scott\n\n    * Musicians:\n          o David Bowie: Vocals\n          o Freddi Buretti: Vocals\n          o Mark Carr Pritchard: Guitar\n          o Mick Ronson: Guitar\n          o Trevor Bolder: Bass guitar\n          o Mick \"Woody\" Woodmansey: Drums\n\nThe official band line-up, fronted by dress designer Freddi Buretti, was a total fabrication; Buretti was at the session but his contributions were simply lost alongside Bowie's.\n\nThis version was also released as a bonus track on the Rykodisc rerelease of The Man Who Sold the World album (1990).

The track had become a popular encore on the tour, and Jim Yukich's video for the song used footage of Bowie and his band performing the song from the 20 July 1983 concert in Philadelphia. A live version, recorded in Montreal on July 13, was on the B-side.\n\nThe single reached #2 in the UK, and #14 in America.

During this time, Bowie was staying in New York, where he met John Lennon. The pair jammed together, leading to a one-day session at Electric Lady Studios in January 1975. There, Carlos Alomar had developed a guitar riff for Bowie's cover of \"Footstompin'\" by The Flairs, which Bowie thought was \"a waste\" to give to a cover. Lennon, who was in the studio with them, sang \"ame\" over the riff, which Bowie turned into \"Fame\" and he thereafter wrote the rest of the lyrics to the song. Lennon performed backing vocals and guitar on the track and worked on the tape loops.\n\nBowie would later describe the song as \"nasty, angry\", and fully admitted that the song was written \"with a degree of malice\" aimed at the Mainman management group with whom he had been working at the time. In 1990, Bowie reflected: \"I'd had very upsetting management problems and a lot of that was built into the song. I've left that all that behind me, now... I think fame itself is not a rewarding thing. The most you can say is that it gets you a seat in restaurants.\" \n\n\"Fame\" became Bowie's biggest hit to that point in the U.S. Bowie would later claim that he had \"absolutely no idea\" that the song would do so well as a single, saying \"I wouldn't know how to pick a single if it hit me in the face.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/_/Fame\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Bowie is rumoured to have chosen the length of time, five years, as a result of a dream in which his deceased father told him he must never fly again and would die in five years.\n\nVarious live versions of the song have been recorded:\n\nBowie played the song at the BBC show In Concert: John Peel on June 3, 1971.

These recordings were made available on the iTunes Music Store in a virtual live EP.\n\nThe track was to be the closing number of David's 1985 Live Aid set at London's Wembley Stadium but was dropped the day before the concert to allow time for the broadcast of the famous appeal video featuring Drive by The Cars as its soundtrack.\n\nIt can also be found on the japanese Best of Bowie and the Russian release of Starman.\n\nThe song has also been covered many times:\nAslan - CD Single (1998)\nCyclefly - Blockbuster: A Glitter Glam Rock Experience (2000).\nEndless - The Dark Side Of David Bowie: A Tribute To David Bowie (1997)\nFish - Songs From The Mirror (1993)\nSeu Jorge recorded a Portuguese version for the film The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and appear on his album The Life Aquatic Studio Sessions.

Active during six decades of popular music and frequently reinventing his music and image, Bowie is widely regarded as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s. Shortly after releasing his 25th studio album Blackstar, it was announced Bowie died on 10 January 2016, following an eighteen-month battle with cancer. At the 59th Grammy Awards on Sun, February 12, 2017, Bowie took the award for \"Best Rock Song\" for \"Blackstar\".\n\nAs a multi-instrumentalist, he was famous for playing the guitar, piano, and saxophone, but also plays the harmonica, drums, cello, marimba, bass guitar, koto, and stylophone. His first single was released in 1964, but he rose to fame with the 1969 single \"Space Oddity\" and the 1972 album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. Subsequent albums have explored blue-eyed soul, electronica, and new wave, often pre-dating these genres' popularity or even the point at which they were defined as genres.\n\t \nBowie was one of the most influential rock musicians from the 1970s to the present. He has sold an estimated 136 million albums in his career and has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In addition to his musical career, Bowie has had success as a painter, web-designer, sculptor, Broadway actor starring in The Elephant Man, and film actor starring in many films.\n \t \nBowie is also credited as being a major inspiration behind the new romantic, futurist movement, and subsequent development of electronic/electronica music.\n\t \nBowie frequently brought the worlds of high art, mime, and straight theatre to his stage acts. His most famous on-stage look was that of Ziggy Stardust; other personae include Halloween Jack, Aladdin Sane, and the Thin White Duke. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

With just\u00a0half a semester left of business school, breakout artist\u00a0DJ Vanic\u00a0did exactly that when he decided to pursue a full-time career in music. Without knowing exactly what it would lead to, the Vancouver based producer took a chance and boy did it pay off.&quot;Family and personal issues came up in my life that\u00a0made me re-evaluate my goals and direction,&quot; Vanic told\u00a0Forbes.com. &quot;I decided that I might as well spend my youth trying for something really cool and different, something I was passionate about. And music was the obvious choice, it&#39;s been one of the biggest parts of my life since I was 3 years old.&quot;\u00a0In as little as two years,\u00a0Vanic quickly made his mark. He took the festival circuit by storm and already managed to play the coveted\u00a0Coachella\u00a0music festival last year.\u00a0You&#39;re probably one of the millions of people who had his remix of Zella Day&#39;s hit single &quot;Hypnotic&quot; on repeat, which he dropped a few months ahead of his debut in the desert. Since then,\u00a0he&#39;s released originals of his own, including his latest track featuring Clara Mae &quot;Staring At the Sun,&quot;\u00a0which exudes the same high-energy as his live sets.\u00a0&quot;Clara sent over the vocal and I fell in love with it,&quot; he shared. &quot;The whole process took probably over a year though, because we kept changing the drop style and re-writing verses. As with any song I work on, it&#39;s the vocal itself that usually inspires me \u2014 whatever the singer makes me feel, I try to replicate that in the music.&quot;\u00a0\u00a0Though it appears his success happened overnight, that certainly wasn&#39;t the case. Vanic opened up\u00a0about how he&#39;s nowhere near where he wants to be skill wise and the importance of continuing to hustle.\u00a0&quot;I&#39;ve never claimed to be an amazing DJ,&quot; he humbly said. &quot;It&#39;s hard to keep creating music that is true to my own sound, but still unique and not repetitive. Though it&#39;s a challenge, I love the struggle behind it, otherwise I wouldn&#39;t be doing it.&quot;\u00a0A stepping stone that propelled his career was the moment\u00a0he signed onto Disruptor Records, the label headed by\u00a0The Chainsmokers&#39; manager, Adam Alpert. Vanic&#39;s own manager\u00a0Sebastian Barwinski (The Standard Group)\u00a0encouraged him to take that next step\u00a0and has backed Vanic\u00a0ever since he decided to make the move. &quot;\u00a0I have a really amazing team of people who help ensure everything in my life and business as Vanic falls into place,&quot; he revealed. &quot;Adam and Disruptor were the right fit. Everything they do seems to be spot on, and they&#39;re really good people to work with.&quot;\u00a0Up next, you can expect\u00a0way more new music from EDM&#39;s rising star. &quot;I have a couple remixes and a few more originals all being wrapped up,&quot; Vanic confirmed. &quot;I&#39;m hoping to release all of them throughout the summer and fall. Then I&#39;ll spend the rest of the time playing, traveling, DJ-ing, and hitting up festivals. After that we will be getting into another full headline tour across North America.&quot;\u00a0Vanic recently\u00a0played Houston&#39;s\u00a0Free Press Summer Fest\u00a0last\u00a0weekend and is scheduled to perform at\u00a0this weekend&#39;s Bonnaroo along with\u00a0Made in America later this year, where he&#39;ll be reunited with The Chainsmokers who are headlining the Philadelphia based event. However, I\u00a0have a feeling there&#39;s plenty more where that came from, this is hands down just the beginning.- FORBES\u00a0\u00a0", "img": null, "title": "Vanic - Black Masquerade", "url": "http://anchorage.eventful.com/events/vanic-black-masquerade-/E0-001-110594666-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Williwaw", "city": "Anchorage"}], "description": "Karla Camila Cabello Estrabao (born in Cuba on March 3, 1997), is a Cuban-born American singer and songwriter. \n\nCabello was a member of the American girl group, Fifth Harmony, but left the group in December 19, 2016. \n\nIn May 2017, Cabello released \"Crying in the Club\" as her first single as a solo artist.

In this song, she plays the innocent girl as well as her neighbour's girlfriend.\n\n\"You Belong with Me\" is a song in which the singer loves a boy, but they are just friends, and he is with someone else. Swift commented about the song's background: \"I came into the writing session with Liz Rose and said\u2026.I've got this idea. I had overheard a friend of mine talking to his girlfriend and he was completely on the defensive saying, 'No, baby...I had to get off the phone really quickly...I tried to call you right back...Of course I love you. More than anything! Baby, I\u2019m so sorry.' She was just yelling at him! I felt so bad for him at that moment. So I came up with the first line 'You\u2019re on the phone with your girlfriend, she\u2019s upset, going off about something that you said', and I ran that into the story line that I\u2019m in love with him and he should be with me instead of her. It just became this whole picture. It was really fun for us to write the line, 'She wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts, She's cheer captain, and I'm on the bleachers'\".\n\nThe music video for \"You Belong with Me\"  was shot at her brother's High School. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/You+Belong+with+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was written by Swift with the song's co-producers Max Martin and Shellback. It was released as the lead single from Swift's upcoming fourth studio album Red (2012) on August 14, 2012 by Big Machine Records. The We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together Songfacts reports that the song was Taylor's first ever #1 on the American Hot 100.\n\nAfter writing Speak Now (2010) entirely solo, she opted to collaborate with different songwriters and producers for Red. Thus, she called Max Martin and Shellback, two songwriters and producers whose work she admired fondly, to discuss a possible collaboration. The trio conceived the concept for \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" incidentally after a friend of Swift's ex-boyfriend walked into the recording studio and spoke of rumors he heard that Swift and her former flame were reuniting. With the friend gone, Martin and Shellback asked Swift to elaborate on the details of the relationship, which she described as \"break up, get back together, break up, get back together, just, ugh, the worst\".

It was written by Taylor Swift, Max Martin and Shellback. The song was released to the radio by Big Machine Records, LLC on November 10, 2014 as the album's second single, after \"Shake It Off\" and is the second track on the album. Musically, \"Blank Space\" is an electropop and minimal song with lyrics that satirize the media's perception of Swift and her relationships.\n\n\"Blank Space\" was a critical and commercial success, having reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 following \"Shake It Off\". Swift became the first woman in the Hot 100's 56-year history to succeed herself at the top spot. The song has also topped charts in Canada, South Africa and Australia. It was included in several critic's year-end lists and was the second and the sixth best song according to Time and Rolling Stone. In January 2015, \"Blank Space\" was ranked at number three on The Village Voice\u200a'\u200bs annual year-end Pazz & Jop critics' poll, one rank before \"Shake It Off\".\n\nThe songs accompanying music video was directed by Joseph Kahn and was shot over three days. The song received its first televised performance at the 2014 American Music Awards and as part of \"Taylor Swift's 1989 Secret Session with iHeartRadio\" on October 27, 2014 in New York City. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/Blank+Space\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song, written by Swift and produced by Nathan Chapman and Swift, was first released as a promotional single for the album on October 17, 2010, by Big Machine Records. The song was later released as an official single on March 7, 2011.\n\nThis song is rumored to be directed at blogger Bob Lefsetz, although nothing was officially confirmed. In addition, it also verses about the harsh criticism Taylor has received since her performance at the 52nd Annual Grammy awards, with Stevie Nicks, considered by many subpar.\n\nTaylor Swift also explains the story behind \"Mean\" on her official website:\n\"The song \"Mean\" is about, well, when you do what I do, which is you put yourself out there for a lot of people to say whatever they want about it, there are a million different opinions from a million different people.\n\nI get it that not everyone is going to like everything that you do, and I get that no matter what, you're going to be criticized for something. But I also get that there are different kinds of ways to criticize someone. There is constructive criticism. There's professional criticism. And then, there's just being mean. There's a line that you cross when you just start to attack everything about a person, and there's one guy who just crossed the line over and over again. Just being mean, and saying things that would ruin my day.\n\nThis happens\u2026no matter what you do, no matter how old you are, no matter what your job is, no matter what your place is in life. There's always going to be someone who's just mean to you. Dealing with that is all you can control about that situation, how you handle it. \"Mean\" is about how I handle it, and sort of my mind set about this whole situation.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/Mean\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Kaempfert originally used it under the title \"Beddy Bye\" as part of the instrumental score for the movie A Man Could Get Killed. The song was made famous in 1966 by Frank Sinatra.\n\nReaching number one on both the Billboard Hot 100 chart and the Easy Listening chart, it was the title song for Sinatra's 1966 album Strangers in the Night, which became his most commercially successful album. The song also reached number one on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nSinatra's recording won him the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance and the Grammy Award for Record of the Year, as well as a Grammy Award for Best Arrangement Accompanying a Vocalist or Instrumentalist for Ernie Freeman at the Grammy Awards of 1967. Hal Blaine was the drummer on the record and Glen Campbell played rhythm guitar.\n\nOne of the most memorable and recognizable features of the record is Sinatra's scat improvisation of the melody with the syllables \"doo-be-doo-be-doo\" as the song fades to the end. Many fans lament the fact that the fade was early and Sinatra's improvisation is cut off too soon.\n\nFor the CD Nothing but the Best, the song was remastered and the running time is 2:45 instead of the usual 2:35. The extra ten seconds is just a continuation of Sinatra's scat singing. The track was recorded on April 11, 1966, one month before the rest of the album.\n\nSinatra despised the song, calling it at one time \"a piece of shit\" and \"the worst fucking song that I have ever heard.\" He was not afraid to voice his disapproval of playing it live. In spite of his contempt for the song, for the first time in eleven years he had a number one song, and it remained on the charts for fifteen weeks.

It was written for and performed in the film by Liza Minnelli.\n\nIn 1980, it was recorded by Frank Sinatra, for his album Trilogy: Past Present Future  (1980), and has since become closely associated with him. He occasionally performed it live with Minnelli as a duet. Sinatra recorded it a second time in duet with Tony Bennett for his 1993 album Duets.\n\nIt should not be confused with the song \"New York, New York\", from Leonard Bernstein/Adolph Green/Betty Comden's musical On the Town, which features the lyric \"New York, New York, is a helluva town / The Bronx is up and the Battery's down...\"\n\nComposers Kander and Ebb stated on the A&E Biography episode about Liza Minnelli that they attribute the song's success to actor Robert De Niro, who rejected their original theme for the film because he thought it was \"too weak.\"\n\nThe song did not become a popular hit until it was picked up in concert by Frank Sinatra during his performances at Radio City Music Hall in October 1978. Subsequently, Sinatra recorded it in 1979 for his 1980 Trilogy set (Reprise Records), and it became one of his signature songs. The single peaked at #30 in June 1980, becoming one of his final hits on the charts. Sinatra made two more studio recordings of the song in 1981 (for his NBC TV special The Man and His Music) and 1993 (for Capitol Records). From the latter, an electronic duet with Tony Bennett was produced for Sinatra's Duets album.\n\nThe lyrics of the Sinatra versions differ slightly from Ebb's original lyrics. Notably, the phrase \"A-number-one,\" which does not appear at all in the original lyrics, is sung twice at the song's rallentando climax. (Ebb has said he \"didn't even like\" Sinatra's use of \"A-number-one\").[1] The phrase is both the first and fourth on a list of four superlative titles the singer strives to achieve \u2014 \"A-number-one, top of the list, king of the hill, A-number-one\" \u2014 where Ebb's original lyrics were closer to \"king of the hill, head of the list, cream of the crop, at the top of the heap.\"\n\nThe song has been embraced as a celebration of New York City, and is often heard at New York-area social events, such as weddings and bar mitzvahs. Many sports teams in the New York area have played this song in their arenas/stadiums, but the New York Yankees are the most prominent example. It has been played over the loudspeakers at both the original and current Yankee Stadiums at the end of every Yankee home game. At first, Sinatra's version was played after a Yankees win, and the Minnelli version after a loss. Minnelli also raised some controversy when, in 2001, she demanded that the Yankees play her version after a win, or not play it at all. The Yankees took the latter option, and played Sinatra's version after wins and losses. \n\nAs of the 2005 season, at the Richmond County Bank Ballpark following Staten Island Yankees games, the Sinatra version is heard regardless of the game's outcome, and was formerly done at Shea Stadium at the end of New York Mets games after the September 11 attacks. \n\nPreviously, Mets fans believed that the song was a \"Yankee Song,\" and began booing it when it was played. It actually first had snippets of the song played after World Series home runs by Ray Knight and Darryl Strawberry during Game 7 of the 1986 World Series.\n\n The song is also sometimes played at New York Knicks games. The Sinatra version is played at the end of every New York Rangers game at Madison Square Garden. It was played at the opening faceoff of Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals at the Garden. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Sinatra/_/Theme+from+New+York,+New+York\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide. \n\nBorn in Hoboken, New Jersey, to Italian immigrants, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the \"bobby soxers\". He released his debut album, The Voice of Frank Sinatra, in 1946. Sinatra's professional career had stalled by the early 1950s, and he turned to Las Vegas, where he became one of its best known residency performers as part of The Rat Pack. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of From Here to Eternity, with his performance subsequently winning an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra released several critically lauded albums, including In the Wee Small Hours (1955), Songs for Swingin' Lovers! (1956), Come Fly with Me (1958), Only the Lonely (1958) and Nice 'n' Easy (1960).\n\nSinatra left Capitol in 1960 to start his own record label, Reprise Records, and released a string of successful albums. In 1965, he recorded the retrospective September of My Years, starred in the Emmy-winning television special Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music, and released the tracks \"Strangers in the Night\" and \"My Way\". After releasing Sinatra at the Sands, recorded at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Vegas with frequent collaborator Count Basie in early 1966, the following year he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Tom Jobim, the album Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim. It was followed by 1968's collaboration with Duke Ellington. Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971, but came out of retirement two years later and recorded several albums and resumed performing at Caesars Palace, and reached success in 1980 with \"New York, New York\". Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured both within the United States and internationally until a short time before his death in 1998.\n\nSinatra forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award for From Here to Eternity, he starred in The Man with the Golden Arm (1955), and received critical acclaim for his performance in The Manchurian Candidate (1962). He appeared in various musicals such as On the Town (1949), Guys and Dolls (1955), High Society (1956), and Pal Joey (1957), winning another Golden Globe for the latter. Toward the end of his career, he became associated with playing detectives, including the title character in Tony Rome (1967). Sinatra would later receive the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1971. On television, The Frank Sinatra Show began on ABC in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Sinatra was also heavily involved with politics from the mid-1940s, and actively campaigned for presidents such as Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, though before Kennedy's death Sinatra's alleged Mafia connections led to his being snubbed.\n\nWhile Sinatra never formally learned how to read music, he had an impressive understanding of it, and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music. A perfectionist, renowned for his dress sense and performing presence, he always insisted on recording live with his band. His bright blue eyes earned him the popular nickname \"Ol' Blue Eyes\". Sinatra led a colorful personal life, and was often involved in turbulent affairs with women, such as with his second wife Ava Gardner. He went on to marry Mia Farrow in 1966 and Barbara Marx in 1976. Sinatra had several violent confrontations, usually with journalists he felt had crossed him, or work bosses with whom he had disagreements. He was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. After his death, American music critic Robert Christgau called him \"the greatest singer of the 20th century\", and he continues to be seen as an iconic figure.\n\nSinatra died with his wife at his side at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on May 14, 1998, aged 82, after a heart attack. Sinatra had ill health during the last few years of his life, and was frequently hospitalized for heart and breathing problems, high blood pressure, pneumonia and bladder cancer. He was further diagnosed as having dementia. He had made no public appearances following a heart attack in February 1997. Sinatra's wife encouraged him to \"fight\" while attempts were made to stabilize him, and his final words were, \"I'm losing.\" Sinatra's daughter, Tina, later wrote that she and her sister, Nancy, had not been notified of their father's final hospitalization, and it was her belief that \"the omission was deliberate. Barbara would be the grieving widow alone at her husband's side.\" The night after Sinatra's death, the lights on the Empire State Building in New York City were turned blue, the lights at the Las Vegas Strip were dimmed in his honor, and the casinos stopped spinning for a minute.\n\nSinatra's funeral was held at the Roman Catholic Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills, California, on May 20, 1998, with 400 mourners in attendance and thousands of fans outside. Gregory Peck, Tony Bennett, and Sinatra's son, Frank Jr., addressed the mourners, who included many notable people from film and entertainment. Sinatra was buried in a blue business suit with mementos from family members\u2014cherry-flavored Life Savers, Tootsie Rolls, a bottle of Jack Daniel's, a pack of Camel cigarettes, a Zippo lighter, stuffed toys, a dog biscuit, and a roll of dimes that he always carried\u2014next to his parents in section B-8 of Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California.\n\nHis close friends Jilly Rizzo and Jimmy Van Heusen are buried nearby.

(C) 2005 Roc-A-Fella Records, LLC."}, "description": "\"Gold Digger\" is a song recorded by American rapper Kanye West featuring guest vocals by Jamie Foxx. Released as the second single from West's second album, Late Registration, \"Gold Digger\" peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 on September 6, 2005, becoming West's and Foxx's second number one single. Co-produced with Jon Brion, the song contains an interpolation of Ray Charles' \"I Got a Woman\" by Foxx.\n\nThe single broke a record for the most digital downloads in a week, selling over 80,000 digital downloads, and was also the fastest selling digital download of all time; both records have since been broken. It was 2005's second-longest running number one on the Billboard Hot 100 at ten weeks, behind Mariah Carey's \"We Belong Together\". \"Gold Digger\" was nominated for Record of the Year at the 2006 Grammy Awards (losing to Green Day's \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\") and won the award for Best Rap Solo Performance. The song lists at number 49 on Billboard magazine's All Time Top 100. The song was voted number 20 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop.\n\nUpon its release, many surmised that West conceived \"Gold Digger\" after watching Jamie Foxx's Oscar-winning portrayal of Ray Charles in the biographical film Ray. However, he had actually recorded the song long before the movie was even developed. West originally produced and recorded the song in Ludacris's home in Atlanta, Georgia for Shawnna's 2004 debut album Worth Tha Weight and had written the chorus from a female first-person viewpoint. However, for reasons unknown, Shawnna passed on the beat. Not wanting to let it go to waste, West decided to write the two verses for the song himself, this time from a male's point-of-view. About a year later, right before \"Gold Digger\" was set to be released, West decided to add a third verse and in a week the new song was recorded and mastered at Sony Music Studios in New York. The idea of employing Jamie Foxx specifically to sing an interpolation of Ray Charles' \"I Got a Woman\" in place of its initial sample did in fact arise from West seeing Ray with his friend John Mayer. Foxx's vocals were recorded over many takes; one version, he sang from start to finish, but the track was retracted as his performance didn't coincide well with the song's instrumentation. After recording another version, Jamie decided to re-record it once more as he felt it contained too many explicit lyrics. Once the track was in place, it was layered with additional instruments provided by Brion and individually selected by West. By the end of their very first studio session together, the pair had completed the basic tracks for final version of \"Gold Digger\".\n\n\"Gold Digger\" contains an interpolation of \"I Got a Woman\" by Ray Charles and a bouncy beat formed from handclaps as well as scratches DJ A-Trak. The song also contains a frequent vocal sample from the song \"Bumpin' Bus Stop\" by Thunder and Lightning. Towards the end, the song employs vintage 1970s synthesizers which emit a honking sound in cadence to Kanye's voice. West delivers a tongue-in-cheek lyrical narrative within \"Gold Digger\" in which he critically depicts the disastrous life of a man married to a woman who manipulates him for financial gain. However, another story arises within the third verse, which illustrates a once destitute black male who earns a fortune and decides to leave a loyal, unselfish girlfriend for a white girl.\n\nThe song's music video was directed by Hype Williams, who also directed West's previous video, \"Diamonds from Sierra Leone\". Shot in a widescreen letterbox format, using stylized art direction with few props, the video features performances shots of West interspersed with footage of Williams' trademark female video models depicted as \"pin-up\" cover models from fictional vintage magazines. The titles of the magazines the women appear on the cover of reflect the correlating verses in the song. Foxx is also present, lip-synching both his own parts and the Ray Charles vocal sample. John Legend makes a brief cameo. At the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards, \"Gold Digger\" received nominations for both Best Male Video and Best Hip Hop Video, but did not win either of these awards. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/_/Gold+Digger\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was released as the first single from the album on July 4, 2013. The song has since peaked at number 69 on the Billboard Hot 100.\nIt\u2019s also probably the most compelling song on Yeezus, an exceedingly visceral (and even sneaky-catchy) listen, with Kanye as in-the-zone as we\u2019ve ever heard him, ranting \u201cEnter the kingdom / But watch who you bring home / They see a black man with a white woman at the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong.\u201d By the time he peaks with his screaming at the end of the chorus, it sounds like a natural release of all the pent-up fury \u2018Ye\u2019s built over the course of the song, and his ending exhortations of \u201cGod!\u201d don\u2019t seem like a self-proclamation as much as the rapper just unsure of any other way to vent his bile.

Its sonic layers are dense: lush string parts interpolated from Patrick Doyle's \"Kissing in the Rain,\" which appears on the soundtrack to the 1998 film \"Great Expectations\" and a bottom-heavy beat that wouldn't be out of place in Miami bass circa 1993-- just to name two.\n\nThere are other eccentric production flourishes reminiscent of some of the less traditional rap and R&B artists and groups through the last 20 years: Prince, De La Soul, Wu-Tang Clan's RZA, Dan the Automator and so on.\n\n\"Robocop\"'s lyrics are a completely different matter. They're fairly standard rap patter: a kiss off to a current or former girlfriend that is/was too clingy. Kanye calls the girl spoiled repeatedly in the outro of the song. She's on him so often that she's similar to RoboCop (or a RoboCop), the title character of the 1987 film of the same name.\n\nThere is speculation-- more than speculation, in fact-- that this song is about his infamous break up with his long-time, on-and-off girlfriend/fiancee Alexis Phifer, a fashion model and clothing line designer. Before this song was released to the general public, August 2008, Phifer said she and Kanye were \"friends\" in April of that same year. \"Robocop\" is the seventh track off of \"808s and Heartbreak,\" mostly dwelling on his mother, Donda West's, death and his subsequent engagement and then break up with Phifer.\n\nWith those two losses seemingly on his mind, Kanye West made \"808s,\" a record significantly more dark and bleak than his previous ones. \"RoboCop\" stands as a contrast to this mood, however. It's a momentarily funky respite of humor, playfulness and swagger in an otherwise maudlin work. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/_/RoboCop\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

With just\u00a0half a semester left of business school, breakout artist\u00a0DJ Vanic\u00a0did exactly that when he decided to pursue a full-time career in music. Without knowing exactly what it would lead to, the Vancouver based producer took a chance and boy did it pay off.&quot;Family and personal issues came up in my life that\u00a0made me re-evaluate my goals and direction,&quot; Vanic told\u00a0Forbes.com. &quot;I decided that I might as well spend my youth trying for something really cool and different, something I was passionate about. And music was the obvious choice, it&#39;s been one of the biggest parts of my life since I was 3 years old.&quot;\u00a0In as little as two years,\u00a0Vanic quickly made his mark. He took the festival circuit by storm and already managed to play the coveted\u00a0Coachella\u00a0music festival last year.\u00a0You&#39;re probably one of the millions of people who had his remix of Zella Day&#39;s hit single &quot;Hypnotic&quot; on repeat, which he dropped a few months ahead of his debut in the desert. Since then,\u00a0he&#39;s released originals of his own, including his latest track featuring Clara Mae &quot;Staring At the Sun,&quot;\u00a0which exudes the same high-energy as his live sets.\u00a0&quot;Clara sent over the vocal and I fell in love with it,&quot; he shared. &quot;The whole process took probably over a year though, because we kept changing the drop style and re-writing verses. As with any song I work on, it&#39;s the vocal itself that usually inspires me \u2014 whatever the singer makes me feel, I try to replicate that in the music.&quot;\u00a0\u00a0Though it appears his success happened overnight, that certainly wasn&#39;t the case. Vanic opened up\u00a0about how he&#39;s nowhere near where he wants to be skill wise and the importance of continuing to hustle.\u00a0&quot;I&#39;ve never claimed to be an amazing DJ,&quot; he humbly said. &quot;It&#39;s hard to keep creating music that is true to my own sound, but still unique and not repetitive. Though it&#39;s a challenge, I love the struggle behind it, otherwise I wouldn&#39;t be doing it.&quot;\u00a0A stepping stone that propelled his career was the moment\u00a0he signed onto Disruptor Records, the label headed by\u00a0The Chainsmokers&#39; manager, Adam Alpert. Vanic&#39;s own manager\u00a0Sebastian Barwinski (The Standard Group)\u00a0encouraged him to take that next step\u00a0and has backed Vanic\u00a0ever since he decided to make the move. &quot;\u00a0I have a really amazing team of people who help ensure everything in my life and business as Vanic falls into place,&quot; he revealed. &quot;Adam and Disruptor were the right fit. Everything they do seems to be spot on, and they&#39;re really good people to work with.&quot;\u00a0Up next, you can expect\u00a0way more new music from EDM&#39;s rising star. &quot;I have a couple remixes and a few more originals all being wrapped up,&quot; Vanic confirmed. &quot;I&#39;m hoping to release all of them throughout the summer and fall. Then I&#39;ll spend the rest of the time playing, traveling, DJ-ing, and hitting up festivals. After that we will be getting into another full headline tour across North America.&quot;\u00a0Vanic recently\u00a0played Houston&#39;s\u00a0Free Press Summer Fest\u00a0last\u00a0weekend and is scheduled to perform at\u00a0this weekend&#39;s Bonnaroo along with\u00a0Made in America later this year, where he&#39;ll be reunited with The Chainsmokers who are headlining the Philadelphia based event. However, I\u00a0have a feeling there&#39;s plenty more where that came from, this is hands down just the beginning.- FORBES\u00a0\u00a0", "img": null, "title": "Vanic - Black Masquerade", "url": "http://anchorage.eventful.com/events/vanic-black-masquerade-/E0-001-110594666-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Williwaw", "city": "Anchorage"}, {"date": "2018-02-09 22:00:00", "description": " Line-up /<p>Merky Ace <br><a>Lemzly Dale</a><br> F17 <br><a>Lukas Wigflex</a><br> Jdot <br> Kyeza<br> DJ Skimask <p> Expert Death presents 001: <br><br> Expert Death is a new event series based in Nottingham which aims to provide a refined showcase of UK electronic music: rebirthing the sound&#39;s original attributes with a focus on intimate venues and all-vinyl sets. <br><br> No Lights, No Stage and a 4 piece Funktion One Soundsystem.</p></p>", "img": null, "title": "Expert Death 001: Merky Ace, Lemzly Dale, F17, Jdot, Kyeza & DJ Skimask", "url": "http://nottingham.eventful.com/events/expert-death-001-merky-ace-lemzly-dale-f17-jd-/E0-001-109855961-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United Kingdom", "venue": "Rough Trade", "city": "Nottingham"}, {"date": "2018-02-10 18:00:00", "description": "Join us on the 14th anniversary of the release of College Dropout as we paint the iconic bear from the cover and listen to some classic Kanye with DJ Ron P.

West said he sped up the drum beat of Dr. Dre\u2019s Xxplosive to use as a replacement for his drums on This Can\u2019t Be Life.\n\nWest has said that Wu-Tang Clan producer RZA influenced him in his style, and has said on numerous occasions that Wu-Tang rappers Ghostface Killah and Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard were some of his all-time favorites. Said by Kanye West: \u201cWu-Tang? Me and my friends talk about this all the time\u2026 We think Wu-Tang had one of the biggest impacts as far as a movement. From slang to style of dress, skits, the samples. Similar to the [production] style I use, RZA has been doing that.\u201d\n\nIn 2004 (after being pushed aside by many record companies who felt he wasn't a marketable hip hop artist), he managed to release his debut solo album, The College Dropout on Roc-A-Fella Records. The album received critical acclaim, defining the style for which West would become known: \"wordplay\" and heavy sampling of 70s soul and RnB tracks. He is also known for his politically-charged rhymes and controversial behavior both inside and outside the realms of music.\n\nHe has since released five more albums, all of which have received numerous awards, high commercial success and critical acclaim. Late Registration (2005); Graduation (2007); 808s & Heartbreak (2008); My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010); Yeezus (2013).\n\nMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, West's fifth studio album, was released in November 2010 to rave reviews from critics, many of whom described it as his best work that solidified his comeback. In stark contrast to his previous effort, which featured a minimalist sound, Dark Fantasy adopts a maximalist philosophy and deals with themes of celebrity and excess. The record included the international hit All of the Lights, and Billboard hits Power, Monster, and Runaway, the latter of which accompanied a 35-minute film of the same name. During this time, West initiated the free music program G.O.O.D. Fridays through his website, offering a free download of previously unreleased songs each Friday of the week, a portion of which were included on the album. Dark Fantasy went on to go platinum in the United States, but its omission as a contender for Album of the Year at the 54th Grammy Awards was viewed as a \"snub\" by several media outlets.\n\nFollowing a headlining set at Coachella 2011 that was described by The Hollywood Reporter as \"one of greatest hip-hop sets of all time,\" West released the collaborative album Watch the Throne with Jay-Z. By employing a sales strategy that released the album digitally weeks before its physical counterpart, Watch the Throne became one of the few major label albums in the Internet age to avoid a leak. Niggas in Paris became the record's highest charting single, peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2012, West released the compilation album Cruel Summer, a collection of tracks by artists from West's record label GOOD Music. Cruel Summer produced four singles, two of which charted within the top twenty of the Hot 100: Mercy and Clique. West also directed a film of the same name that premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival in custom pyramid-shaped screening pavilion featuring seven screens.\n\nSessions for West's sixth solo effort begin to take shape in early 2013 in his own personal loft's living room at a Paris hotel. Determined to \"undermine the commercial,\" he once again brought together close collaborators and attempted to incorporate Chicago drill, dancehall, acid house, and industrial music. Primarily inspired by architecture, West's perfectionist tendencies led him to contact producer Rick Rubin fifteen days shy of its due date to strip down the record's sound in favor of a more minimalist approach. Initial promotion of his sixth album included worldwide video projections of the album's music and live television performances.\n\nYeezus, West's sixth album, was released June 18, 2013 to rave reviews from critics. It became the rapper's sixth consecutive number one debut. Def Jam issued \"Black Skinhead\" to radio in July 2013 as the album's lead single. On September 6, 2013, Kanye West announced he would be headlining his first solo tour in five years, to support Yeezus, with fellow American rapper Kendrick Lamar, accompanying him along the way.\n\nIn November 2013, West stated that he was working on and recording his next studio album. The album is being produced by Rick Rubin and Q-Tip. In April 2014, he appeared in Future's new single titled I Won. Kanye released the first single from the album on December 31, 2014 entitled Only One. All Day the second single from Kanye's new album was released on March 2, 2015. West had originally stated the album would be called 'So Help Me God' but in May, 2015, changed the album title to 'SWISH'. \n\nPersonal life:\nWest was born in Atlanta, Georgia. When he was three years old (as mentioned in Hey Mama) his parents divorced, and he moved with his mother to Chicago, Illinois. His father, Ray West, was a former Black Panther; one of the first black photojournalists at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution; and is now a Christian counselor. Kanye\u2019s late mother, Dr. Donda West, worked as a Professor of English at Clark Atlanta University, and the Chair of the English Department at Chicago State University before retiring to serve as Kanye\u2019s manager. He was later raised in an upper middle class background, attending Polaris High School in suburban Oak Lawn, Illinois after living in Chicago.\n\nAfter attending The American Academy of Art, a Chicago art school, West attended Chicago State University but eventually dropped out due to poor grades and in order to continue working on his music career. While attending school, West produced for local artists, including on rapper Grav\u2019s debut album Down to Earth. He later gained fame by producing hit singles for major hip hop/R&B artists, including Jay-Z, Talib Kweli, Cam\u2019ron, Paul Wall, Common, Mobb Deep, Jermaine Dupri, Scarface, The Game, Alicia Keys, Janet Jackson and John Legend among others. He also \u201cghost-produced\u201d for his once mentor Deric Angelettie according to his song Last Call and the credits of Nas\u2019 Poppa Was a Playa.\n\nKanye is married to Kim Kardashian. Together they have a daughter named North, and a son named Saint.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Her first name \"Dua\" is an Albanian word which means \"love\" or \"want\". Her parents, who are ethnic Albanians from Prishtina, had left Prishtina in the 1990s. Among the schools she attended was the Sylvia Young Theatre School. She moved with her family to Kosovo in 2008, the year the country declared its independence from Serbia. At the age of 15, she moved back to London and lived with friends, because she wanted to build a career in music. She began working as a model at age 16. Lipa grew up listening to her father, the Kosovan rock singer Dukagjin Lipa, sing. At the age of 14 she began posting covers of her favourite songs by artists such as Christina Aguilera and Nelly Furtado on YouTube.\n\nIn 2015 Dua Lipa began working on her debut album for Warner Bros. Records. In August 2015 she released her first single \"New Love\", produced by Emile Haynie and Andrew Wyatt. She released her second single \"Be the One,\" written by Lucy \"Pawws\" Taylor, in October 2015. Dua Lipa has said that \"Be the One is the only song on my album I haven't written ... [but] I couldn't not take it, it's my favourite thing\". Dua Lipa describes her musical style as \"dark pop\". On 30 November 2015, she was revealed as one of the acts on the \"BBC Sound of...2016\" long list. Her first tour in the UK and Europe began in January 2016. Her self-titled debut album was released on 2 June 2017. Her European Self-Titled Tour starts in October. She will be also supporting Bruno Mars on his 24k Magic World Tour in the USA in September 2017 and later in February and March 2018 in New Zealand and Australia.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dua+Lipa\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Released in 2004, the single peaked at #5 in the USA becoming Maroon 5's second Top 10 single; it also peaked at #4 in the UK. The song reached #1 in Australia and remained at the top for 5 non-consecutive weeks; it also peaked at #2 in Latin America becoming Maroon 5's second consecutive Top 3. The song also reached #1 on the world-wide chart. The single is noted for its music video which stars Kelly Preston.\n\nThe song was inspired by the complicated relation between Maroon 5's vocalist, Adam Levine, and his ex-girlfriend, Jane. The song is one of the band's more melodic-sounding songs, with its instantly-recognisable bassline running parallel to the main textured guitar riff. In some versions of the song, including the UK release, the age of the girl in the lyrics is seventeen instead of eighteen.\n\nWhen the band was commissioned to perform at the AFI Life Achievement Award ceremony for George Lucas, this song was chosen in tribute to Lucas' children, mainly his oldest daughter. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Maroon+5/_/She+Will+Be+Loved\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The group was formed in 1994 as Kara's Flowers while its members were still in high school and originally consisted of Adam Levine (lead vocals, guitar), Jesse Carmichael (guitar, backing vocals) Mickey Madden (bass guitar) and Ryan Dusick (drums). Kara's Flowers signed to Reprise Records and released an album, \"The Fourth World\", in 1997. After a tepid response to the album, the band parted ways with the record label and the members attended college. Dusick and Madden stayed local at UCLA, while Levine and Carmichael relocated to the east coast to attend Five Towns College. While Levine and Carmichael were in New York, they began to take notice of the urban music surrounding them and later let the style influence the songs they wrote.\n\nIn 2001, the band regrouped, with guitarist James Valentine added to the line-up, and pursued a new direction under the name: Maroon 5. At this point, Jesse Carmichael switched to playing the keyboards and this has become his main instrument in the band (although he also plays rhythm guitar to this day). After these changes, Maroon 5 signed with Octone Records and released their debut album, \"Songs About Jane\", in June 2002. The album's lead single \"Harder to Breathe\", received heavy airplay, which helped the album to debut at number six on the Billboard 200 chart. The band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2005. For the next few years, the band toured extensively worldwide in support of Songs About Jane and produced two live recordings: 2004's \"1.22.03.Acoustic\" and 2005's \"Live Friday the 13th\". In 2006, Ryan Dusick officially left the band after suffering from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn. The band recorded their second album, \"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\" and released it in May 2007. The album reached number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and the lead single, \"Makes Me Wonder\", became the band's first number-one song on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nOn September 21, 2010, the band released their third studio album entitled \"Hands All Over\". It was re-released in 2011 to include the single \"Moves like Jagger\" (featuring Christina Aguilera). While the original version of the album received mixed reviews, \"Moves like Jagger\" reached the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The band released their next album, \"Overexposed\", on June 26, 2012. All four singles of the album were really successful on the charts - for example, the second single from Overexposed, \"One More Night\" (released on June 19, 2012), reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2014, the band signed with Interscope Records and released their fifth studio album, \"V\", with the very-first line-up of six official band members, as keyboardist and backing vocalist PJ Morton became an official member in 2012. The album debuted at top of the weekly Billboard 200 chart. Since its debut in 2002, the band has sold more than 15 million albums in the United States and over 100 million singles and 27 million albums worldwide. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Maroon+5\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

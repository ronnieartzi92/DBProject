The music on &quot;Luciferian Towers&#39;&quot; took shape over the past two years, amidst GYBEs collaborative performances with the Holy Body Tattoo dance companys monumental, and spurred by the commissioning of new compositions memorializing the 100th anniversary of the WWI Battle of Messines, which premiered at a live concert event on the site of the massacre at Heuvelland, Belgium this past June. &quot;Luciferian Towers&quot; is Godspeeds third album since the groups reunion in 2011 and their second consecutive single LP-length record (following three double-album releases in 2000, 2002 and 2012). The band provides this statement and track description for the new album: this, this long-playing record, a thing we made in the midst of communal mess, raising dogs and children. eyes up and filled with dreadful joy we aimed for wrong notes that explode, a quiet muttering amplified heavenward. we recorded it all in a burning motorboat. (context as follows:) 1. UNDOING A LUCIFERIAN TOWERS look at that fucking skyline! big lazy money writ in dull marble obelisks! imagine all those buildings much later on, hollowed out and stripped bare of wires and glass, listen- the wind is whistling through all 3,000 of its burning window-holes! 2. BOSSES HANG labor, alienated from the wealth it creates, so that holy cow, most of us live precariously! kicking at it, but barely hanging on! also the proud illuminations of our shortened lives! also more of us than them! also what we need now is shovels, wells, and barricades! 3. FAM / FAMINE how they kill us = absentee landlord, burning high-rise. the loud panics of child-policemen and their exploding trigger-hands. with the dull edge of an arbitrary meritocracy. neglect, cancer maps, drone strike, famine. the forest is burning and soon theyll hunt us like wolves. 4. ANTHEM FOR NO STATE kanada, emptied of its minerals and dirty oil. emptied of its trees and water. a crippled thing, drowning in a puddle, covered in ants. the ocean doesnt give a shit because it knows its dying too. finally and in conclusion;the luciferian towers L.P. was informed by the following grand demands:+ an end to foreign invasions+ an end to borders+ the total dismantling of the prison-industrial complex+ healthcare, housing, food and water acknowledged as an inalienable human right+ the expert fuckers who broke this world never get to speak again much love to all the other lost and wondering ones,xoxoxox gods pee / montral / 4 juillet, 2017", "img": null, "title": "Godspeed You!

They dissolved in 2001, but reunited in 2006 and again in 2007 for a few festival dates and brief US tours. The group was founded by Samoth (guitar) and Ihsahn (guitar, vocals). Emperor have sold over 500,000 albums worldwide over the course of their career as of 2003.\n\nIn their youth, Ihsahn and Samoth met at a rock music seminar. The two young men began playing together under various names; first Dark Device, then Xerasia, then Embryonic. The group soon evolved into the now well-known band Thou Shalt Suffer. Soon, however, Samoth began to write music outside of Thou Shalt Suffer, and together with Ihsahn and a new bass player called Mortiis (later of his own eponymous band Mortiis), Emperor was formed. After a short while together, the band released a demo entitled Wrath of the Tyrant. It quickly gained popularity in the underground and attracted the attention of the then-start-up label Candlelight. Soon afterwards, a record contract was signed, Samoth moved to rhythm guitar, Ihsahn continued the vocal duties and lead guitars, and Faust was recruited as a drummer. The band was signed to the infamous first black metal label, Deathlike Silence Productions, and planned to release their next album soon, though the band never managed to release any material while signed to DSP.\n\nEmperor were one of the bands somewhat involved in the church burnings during the mid 1990s. Samoth was jailed 16 months for taking part in church burnings with Varg Vikernes (Burzum), along with other members of the Norwegian black metal scene. Drummer Faust was jailed for church burning and for the stabbing and murder of a homosexual man in 1992 (he was never suspected for it until 2 years later when he was arrested in 1994).\n\nThe group disbanded in 2001 because they felt they had lived up to everything they wanted to with Emperor. They have received \"legendary\" status, toured worldwide, have a large catalog of releases, and they didn't want to be known as another group that \"never knows when to quit making music\". The band reunited to play at Scream Magazine's anniversary festival and to headline the 2006 editions of Norway's Inferno Festival and Germany's Wacken Open Air. In an interview with UK Magazine Terrorizer, Ihsahn hinted at the possibility of another Emperor album, but stated that Emperor is now a side project.\n\nA Tablature Book based on their Scattered Ashes: A Decade of Emperial Wrath compilation album, containing thirteen Emperor tracks from their back catalogue, transcribed by Ihsahn with a foreword also by him, was released October 31 2007 via Candlelight Records. Emperor's albums were also re-issued in a special box version with a bonus poster on Aug. 21, 2007.\n\nSamoth announced on October 23, 2007 that Emperor had begun preparing a second official DVD release. On December 8, 2008 it was revealed that this release will be called Live Inferno and come in the form of a double-disc live album and a live DVD, taken from their appearances at Inferno and Wacken metal festivals during their brief reunion. It was released on April 16, 2009 in Europe and April 21 in North America.\n\n2) Emperor is a drum 'n' bass and dubstep DJ from Halifax, UK. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Emperor\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

But one only needs to get the lead singer and guitarist speaking to their songwriting process to witness firsthand just how passionate he remains about its teeming creativity. Its a beautiful process, the effusive singer says of the almost epiphany-like manner in which the band typically translates its vivid ideas to melodies and lyrics. Youre trying to figure out exactly what it is youre trying to say. And then, Bam! Lightning strikes, everybodys in the room, and its like the heavens open. Suddenly youre able to write a song.The Lone Bellow, which also now includes Jason Pipkin on keys/bass, has long nurtured a deep and highly personal connection with their music. But with Walk Into A Storm, their third studio album, due on September 15 via Descendant Records/ Sony Music Masterworks, the band turned inward like never before. We covered such a broad range of emotion on the album, Elmquist says of the raw, intimate and undeniably soulful Dave Cobb-produced LP recorded in Nashvilles famed RCA Studio A. The 10-track album, Elmquist says, is centered on the human condition and how youre trying to connect with it, and with stunning tracks including Is It Ever Gonna Be Easy? and Long Way To Go, it features some of the bands most poignant material to date.When creating the follow-up to 2014s cherished Then Came The Morning, the band confronted and ultimately overcame a host of personal obstacles: not only did all the members and their respective families work through a relocation from New York City to Nashville, but on the day they were to begin recording the album Elmquist entered a rehab facility for issues stemming from alcohol abuse. Theres a thousand different ways this could have gone down but its the way it did, says Elmquist, says the tumultuous experience helped put what were doing in perspective. I got to see the love and friendship we have for each other in action. Im thankful.Our band was the receiver of a lot of grace and kindness from the music community, Williams adds, citing peers and industry folks offering words of encouragement as well as the non-profit MusicCares greatly aiding in the costs of the guitarists treatment.Elmquists situation presented a logistical challenge for the band they now had nine days to record instead of the pre-planned 20. But as Pipkin notes, the sacrifice paled in comparison to what we have with each other. Without our friendships we dont have anything, she says. Thats the reason we do this. To forge ahead without taking care of each other doesnt work. We wouldnt be able to do what we do. Working with the notoriously no-nonsense Cobb (Chris Stapleton, Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell), was a richly rewarding process. It was also one that helped the band kick out the jams in short order. Theres no real bells and whistles, Elmquist recalls of Cobbs no-frills recording process. You go practice a song, play it, record it and put it on a record.The results are stunning: from the orchestral, uplifting May You Be Well, to Long Way To Go, a beatific piano-anchored ballad Elmquist wrote while in rehab; and Between The Lines, a harmony-drenched sing-along Williams says acts as both a letter to Elmquist and an exploration of the push-pull of drawing art from pain.Theres this lie that the only good and worthy art that can be made has to come from tragedy and darkness, Williams offers.

I just love being able to have that opportunity with these friends.The singer pauses, and with a supreme sense of contentment in his voice, notes proudly of his band mates: Theyre pretty good musicians. But theyre truly amazing people.&quot;The feeling I get singing with Zach and Brian is completely natural and wholly electrifying, says Kanene. Our voices feel like they were made to sing together.&quot; Long before they combined their voices, the three members of the Lone Bellow were singing on their own. Brian had been writing and recording as a solo artist for more than a decade, with three albums under his own name. Kanene and her husband Jason were living in Beijing, China, hosting open mic nights, playing at local clubs and teaching music lessons. Zach began writing songs in the wake of a family tragedy: After his wife was thrown from a horse, he spent days in the hospital at her bedside, bracing for the worst news. The journal he kept during this period would eventually become his first batch of songs as a solo artist. Happily, his wife made a full recovery. When Kanenes brother asked her and Zach to sing O Happy Day together at his wedding, they discovered their voices fit together beautifully, but starting a band together seemed impossible when they lived on opposite sides of the world. Brian soon relocated to New York and Kanene moved there to attend culinary school a couple years later. The three got together in their new hometown to work on a few songs of Zachs, hed been chipping away at the scene as a solo artist for awhile by then. After hitting those first harmonies did they decide to abandon all other pursuits. Soon the trio was playing all over the city, although they considered Rockwood Music Hall on the Lower East Side to be their home. They opened for the Civil Wars, Dwight Yokam, Brandi Carlile and the Avett Brothers, and their self-titled debut, produced by Nashvilles Charlie Peacock (the Civil Wars, Holly Williams) and released in January 2013, established them as one of the boldest new acts in the Americana movement. After two hard years of constant touring, the band was exhausted but excited. By 2014, they had written nearly 40 songs on the road and were eager to get them down on tape. After putting together a list of dream producers, they reached out to their first choice, the National guitarist Aaron Dessner, who has helmed albums by the L.A. indie-rock group Local Natives and New York singer-songwriter Sharon Van Etten. It occurred to me that it would be fun to get together and make music with them, says Aaron. My main interest in producing records is community and friendship more than making money. I already do a lot of traveling and working with the National, so when I have to time to work with other artists, it should be fun and meaningful. Aaron is just so kind, Zach says. And he has surrounded himself with all these incredibly talented people, like Jonathan Low, the engineer. His brother Bryce [Dessner, also a guitarist for the National] wrote these amazing brass and string arrangements, and he got some of his friends to play with us. Dessner and the Lone Bellow spent two weeks recording at Dreamland in upstate New York, a nineteenth-century church that had been converted into a homey studio. The singers found the space to inspire the emotional gravity necessary for the material and the acoustics they were looking for. (For Kanene, Dreamland had one other bonus: Im a big Muppets fan, and it looks exactly like the church where Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem lived.) Aaron set them up in a circle in what had once been the sanctuary, with microphones hanging in the rafters to capture the sound of their voices bleeding together. Most of the vocals were recorded in single takes, a tactic that adds urgency to songs like Heaven Dont Call Me Home and If You Dont Love Me. There were a couple of times when somebody sang the wrong word or hit a bad note, and we just had to keep going, says Zach, who says that recording Marietta in particular was dauntingespecially the moment near the end when he hits an anguished high note, bends it even higher, and holds it for an impossibly long time. Its a startling display of vocal range, but its also almost unbearably raw in its emotional honesty. Marietta is probably the darkest song on the whole record, Zach explains, and its based on something that happened between my wife and me. The band was getting ready to record that song when all of a sudden my wife showed up with our youngest baby. It was a great surprise, a beautiful moment. So I was able to go out and sing that song, knowing she was there to help me carry the moment. These are true stories, says Brian. These arent things we made up. We tried to write some songs that had nothing to do with our personal stories, but we just didnt respond to them. But were best buds, so we know each others personal stuff and trust each other to figure out what needs to be said and how to say it. Case in point: Brian wrote Call to War about his own struggles during his twenties, but gave the song to Kanene to sing. The content is painful and brutal, she says, but the imagery, the vocals, they build something delicate and ethereal. That kind of contrast illuminates the true beauty and power of a song. Says Brian, We do this one thing together, and we carry each other. Hopefully that makes the listener want to be a part of it. It becomes a communal thing, which means that theres never a sad song to sing. Its more a celebration of the light and the dark.", "img": null, "title": "The Lone Bellow", "url": "http://portland.eventful.com/events/lone-bellow-/E0-001-109480212-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Aladdin Theater", "city": "Portland"}, {"date": "2018-04-06 22:00:00", "description": " \n", "img": null, "title": "The Lone Sharks", "url": "http://eventful.com/amagansett/events/lone-sharks-/E0-001-110631180-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "The Stephen Talkhouse", "city": "Amagansett"}, {"date": "2018-03-17 20:00:00", "description": null, "img": null, "title": "Los Lonely Boys", "url": "http://chicago.eventful.com/events/los-lonely-boys-/E0-001-107975740-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "City Winery", "city": "Chicago"}, {"date": "2018-03-08 19:30:00", "description": null, "img": null, "title": "Los Lonely Boys", "url": "http://dallas.eventful.com/events/los-lonely-boys-/E0-001-107955643-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "House of Blues - Dallas", "city": "Dallas"}, {"date": "2018-03-14 20:00:00", "description": null, "img": null, "title": "Los Lonely Boys", "url": "http://atlanta.eventful.com/events/los-lonely-boys-/E0-001-108696297-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "City Winery - Atlanta", "city": "Atlanta"}], "description": "Lone is electronic music producer Matt Cutler, from Nottingham, UK, experimenting with hip-hop, early 90's hardcore and techno, His d\u00e9but \"Lemurian\" was released on local label Dealmaker back in 2008; followed by a remix on Warp Records for Bibio and a deal with Actress' London label Werk Discs, where he released the follow-up album \"Ecstasy & Friends\", which merged an endless range of styles including 80's funk, 90's hiphop.

Though it failed to crack the Top 40 in any country it was released (UK #41, Canada #45, US #49, Australia #90), over the years \"Tempted\" has become one of Squeeze's most well known songs, especially in North America, thanks to its use in various TV commercials and in modern video games such as Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. Unlike other Squeeze songs, which are usually sung by guitarist/songwriter Glenn Tilbrook, the song's lead vocal is mainly by keyboardist Paul Carrack, though Tilbrook and producer Elvis Costello also sing for a few lines in the second verse. The song was written by Squeeze members Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook.\n\nTilbrook considers this one of his favorite songs. He told Songfacts: \u201cIt was our first song. It was when we grew up, really, as a band. When we finished it I couldn't quite believe it was us.\u201d\n\nTempted has been covered numerous times, including versions by Sting, Richard Thompson, Joe Cocker, The Georgetown Chimes, and Rockapella. Jools Holland also covered this song on his album Lift The Lid, which was a nod to Jools's history with the band.\n\nIn 1993, Squeeze remixed and overdubbed the original recording to create a 'new' version of the song for the soundtrack to the film Reality Bites. This version received some radio airplay and was dubbed \"Tempted '94.\"\n\nIn 2002, the song reached a new audience as part of the Grand Theft Auto: Vice City soundtrack, and in 2008 as downloadable content for the music video game series Rock Band.\n\nIn 2010, the song re-appeared in re-recorded form on Spot the Difference, a retrospective of Squeeze hits performed by many of the original artists. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Squeeze/_/Tempted\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

(1979)"}, "description": "\"Up the Junction\" was the third single released from Squeeze's second album, Cool for Cats. Written by band members Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook, it remains one of the band's most popular and well-remembered songs (especially in the UK); it reached #2 on the UK Singles Chart. It is quite notable for not having a chorus.\n\nSpeaking with Songfacts  about this song in an interview, Glenn Tilbrook explained : \"The lyric was a story that had no obvious repeats, and I thought it read perfectly well as it was. I was thinking of something like Positively 4th Street as a template when I wrote the music.\"\n\nA blink and you miss it intro, a punched drum fill and you're in.  The desire for economy is taken to extremes: no time wasting chorus and definitely no soloing, even the birth takes only half an hour.  The arrangement is simple and breathtakingly subtle: the bridge being the verse's melody over different backing and the final heartbreaking passage sung over a pared down band with a simple string arrangement.\nThe focus rests almost entirely on the words. Lyrically it's probably the most unpretentiously detailed song since She's Leaving Home, from the opening line \"I never thought it would happen...\", through the job with Stanley and the bunch of flowers we hang on every word.  Until in the end, as we always knew, there is tragedy.\nIt seems to have been quietly forgotten, but this very English kitchen sink drama shines as brightly today as any of it's more celebrated contemporaries and on a par with the greats.  \nHighlights abound, I suppose we all have our favourites, but the line that gets me?  \"I'd beg for some forgiveness, but begging's not my business.\"\nAnd there you have it: a story of al fresco sex, happiness, birth, alcoholism, gambling, separation and good ol' fashioned remorse, crammed into three detail packed minutes.\nYou can hear all the great story records from Patches through Hey Joe and Piss Factory right up to Common People singing down the years.

It featured a comparatively rare lead vocal performance from Squeeze lyricist Chris Difford, one of only two occasions he sang lead on a Squeeze single A-side (the other was 1989's \"Love Circles\"). The single, slightly edited from the album track, peaked at #2 on the UK Singles Chart, making it one of the band's biggest hits. Difford brought a cockney accent to the way the lyrics were sung which makes it distinctive as well. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Squeeze/_/Cool+For+Cats\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A popular British new wave band\n2. An American rapper\n3. A Nigerian Dancehall artist\n\n1. Squeeze is a rock band which formed in London, England in 1974. The band was formed by songwriters Glenn Tilbrook (vocals, guitar) and Chris Difford (guitar, vocals) who have been the group's only constant members since the band's formation (with the exception of Difford's hiatus from the band in 1999). Aside from Difford and Tilbrook, the band currently consists of Stephen Large (keyboards), Lucy Shaw (bass) and Simon Hanson (drums).\n\nThe group initially split in 1982, but reunited in 1985 until splitting once more in 1999. Difford and Tilbrook reunited the band in 2007 with bassist John Bentley (who had been a member of the band from 1980 to 1982), keyboardist Stephen Large and drummer Simon Hanson.\n\nThe original lineup of the band also included pianist Jools Holland, who went on to become a popular solo artist and bandleader, and is now best known as the host of the critically-acclaimed and highly successful British music TV show Later with Jools Holland.  Squeeze's lineup in the 1980s also featured the lead vocals of Paul Carrack, who was one of the lead singers of Ace - whose hit \"How Long?\" reached #3 in the U.S. charts and also a vocalist with Mike and the Mechanics as well as a solo artist.\n\nSince the release of their last album, 1998's Domino, no new Squeeze material has been produced. Glenn and Chris have each subsequently embarked on solo careers, with South East Side Story released in 2006 containing a number of reworked Squeeze tracks.\n\nIn 2007, Glenn and Chris announced that they were reforming Squeeze for some concerts in the USA and Britain. These dates are to support a new Greatest Hits CD and DVD (Essential Squeeze- released 30/04/07)  Glenn Tilbrook is also releasing his original demos on CD, the first of these (The Past Has Been Bottled) is also released on 30/04/07. \n\n2.

It  was initially released in 1994 as a track on 45 RPM on the MFS record label, and was van Dyk's first album. It was later reworked and re-released in 1998 as \"E-Werk Remix\" on Deviant Records, a homage to the E-Werk nightclub where van Dyk used to be the resident DJ, charted around the world, reaching #28 in the UK Singles Chart and #26 in the Irish Singles Chart. In 2009, van Dyk retooled the track once again on \"For An Angel 2009\".\nThree videos exist for the track, one from 1994, filmed in the Riviera Maya in Mexico; the other from 1998, featuring footage from the Love Parade in Berlin; the third from 2009, filmed in a exhibition in L.A. and Berlin. The first video is available on Global.\nThis song and another Paul van Dyk's song \"Buenaventura\" shares the similar subtle synth riff. \"Buenaventura\" is on a slower tempo and adds lot of reverb to the original riff. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+van+Dyk/_/For+an+Angel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

BT was entered into the Guinness Book of World Records for his song &quot;Somnambulist (Simply Being Loved)&quot;. This song was recognized as using the largest number of vocal edits in a song (6,178 edits).[2] BT&#39;s work with stutter edit techniques led to the formation of software development company, Sonik Architects, and the development of the sound-processing software plug-in Stutter Edit.

After mastering the art of DJing in his teenage years, Mark decided to try his hand at making his own music to play live. One of his first releases, Destination 6, received Tune of the Week status on Armin van Buurens radio show, A State Of Trance, and was supported by some of the biggest names on the planet. The next single led to Mark signing with Armada Music. Fade 2 Black was, once again, selected as Tune of the Week on ASOT, truly cementing Mark as one to watch within the world of trance. Armin van Buuren then selected Marks tracks for his annual, platinum-selling A State Of Trance compilation three years in a row. In addition to the compilations, Armin also featured one of Marks tunes on his Wii Game and gave him the opportunity to remix Minack, the massive collaboration with Ferry Corsten. Since then Mark has gone on to release on some of the biggest labels in dance music, including but not limited to: Armada, Revealed, and Spinnin Records. Also on his list of achievements is the mix compilation Worldwide Trance Sounds Vol. 6on Armada Music. Mark Sixma has toured extensively, with big performances across the globe alongside top DJs like Armin van Buuren, Ferry Corsten, Gareth Emery, Judge Jules, Markus Schulz, Paul van Dyk, Sander van Doorn and W&W. Mark has performed at several festivals including Stereosonic, A State of Trance 550 & 650, Nature One (two times) as well as Electronic Family, Escapade Music Festival, and Ultra Music Festival Miami in 2015. He also played alongside Armin van Buuren for the official closing party of the legendary Guverment in Toronto.In 2013 Mark Sixma made his debut on W&Ws fast-rising label Mainstage Musicwith his epic smash Requiem. This fought off competition to hit the Beatport Trance Chart at #1, beating the likes of world number one DJ and producer Armin van Buuren, whilst also holding the #1 slot on major digital download sites Audiojelly and Trackitdown, achieving a unique hat-trick of chart-topping positions! His tune Requiemwas the most played trance track of 2013, and he had scored six top 10 Beatport records for his original tracks Character, Refused, and The Saga, and his remixes of Orjan Nilsen (Mafioso), Cosmic Gate (Crushed), and Jorn van Deynhoven (New Horizon) up to this point. 2014 was a breakout year for Sixma, who released an updated version of the iconic Adagio For Strings, Shadow(W&W Edit), remixed Cosmic Gate and Armin van Buuren (Save My Night), and released on both Armada Music and Revealed Recordings. While Adagioheld the #1 spot on Beatport, Sixma got to kick himself out of the charts with his next record, as hisremix of Falling Backsupplanted Adagioto claim the #1 position in the charts from himselfa feat very few have accomplished. Mark Sixmas first North American Tour took place in 2015, following his top-level releases and remixes from the previous year. After seeing heavy support from Armin van Buuren, the two finally collaborated on Panta Rhei, a major accomplishment for Sixma that would lock in his place in the the dance music elite. As Mark Sixma shifts gears, he heads into the future with more ammunition than ever, and hes poised to dominate the industry that hes shook since the very beginning of his career. Local Support MarQ.

Because his community did not have a true club culture, Paul van Dyk listened to the radio where he discovered his passion for music that extended beyond Techno music \u2013 he wanted to create a different, more unique sound. In the early 1990\u2019s Paul van Dyk was spinning regularly at various clubs in Berlin before releasing his first album 45 RPM in 1994.   But it wasn\u2019t until the release of his second album Seven Ways which catapulted him into the Top 100, followed by the release of his hit single \u201cFor An Angel,\u201d which began to earn him praise across the globe. By the time Paul van Dyk released Out There & Back in 2000, it became clear that the Berlin-based musician had far more to offer than his signature club sets and remixes that had already defined him as one of the most influential DJs and producers of all time.  His first compilation mix CD Politics of Dancing was released in 2001, followed by Global in 2003 \u2013 a DVD which illustrates his own experiences traveling the world.  \n\nPaul van Dyk created the internet radio station VONYC.com focused on the electronic dance scene.  \n\nPaul van Dyk\u2019s touring diary remains incredibly hectic with regular globetrotting stops at major venues across the globe from New York, London, Ibiza to India, China and Singapore. In the little time remaining between all the travel, Paul van Dyk resides in Berlin where he has his own radio show \u201cPaul van Dyk\u2019s VONYC Sessions\u201d which airs weekly on Area 33 on Sirius Radio on Thursday nights at 6PM ET (and rebroadcasts Saturdays at 8PM ET and Tuesdays at Midnight ET) and Soundgarden which airs every Saturday 2pm \u2013 4pm (EST) on Fritz radio and over the internet (www.fritz.de).\n\nFor more information, please visit www.paulvandyk.com or www.myspace.com/paulvandyk. \n\n1991 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Paul+van+Dyk\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Growing up in central PA, Jeff learned to write songs as a teenager by listening to Ramones records, while Ben learned on his own studying David Bowie. In their early 20s they decided to join forces and began playing and writing together. The Brown brothers have always been infatuated by the excitement of American rock n roll and the cinematic soundscapes of British post punk and indie music, with one foot in the world of The Replacements and another in The Smiths, with the literary influence of Lou Reed and the rainy day dreams of The Cure. Being based in Texas, Jeff and Ben feel that the eclecticism of Doug Sahm and the opera of Roy Orbison has also been an influence on their music.The band is led by Jeff Brown (Shinyribs/ATX top ten bass players of 2017) and Ben Brown who share lead vocals and electric guitar duty, backed by Alex Moralez on drums (Bo Diddley), Roger Wuthrich on bass and newest addition Christine Smith on keyboards and background vocals.Their current release The Grown Ups was recorded at The Shire in ATX. It was produced, engineered and mixed by Christine Smith (Crash Test Dummies, Jesse Malin, Ryan Adams & Marah.) The foundation tracks were recorded completely analog in PA by Smith with David Bielanko of Marah. Special guests on the record include Keith Langford (The Gourds, Shinyribs) on harmonica and Jeff Johnston (Ramsay Midwood) on saw.The Grown Ups is a subversive and eclectic album informed by the passion and possibility of rock n&#39; roll, that takes a hard look at the here and now of modern life. Songs range from the explosive and humorous &quot;Night of a Thousand Tuesdays,&quot; that ponders the greatest horror movie of all - endless weeks at a meaningless job - to the gentle and haunting title track, which is an explanation from an adult to a child about why adults havent left the world a better place for them. The songs delve into both the explicitly political and the extremely personal. &quot;Thats How the West Was Lost&quot; is two and half minutes of exuberant pop, steeped in the soundscapes of a Spaghetti Western, that deals with Americas original sin in the exploitation of Native peoples. The 8 minute sonic death march of &quot;Hand Coming Down&quot; is a gloomy, gothic romance from the point of view of someone coming of age in the modern world.Jeff believes that the best records always straddle the line between accessibility and mystery. Thematically I knew that we wanted to make an unsettling record that spoke to the insanity of modern America, but more poetic than topical in its approach.

The soundtrack for his upbringing was provided by his guitar slinging, country singing mother, and influenced by any music he could find, not to mention Billy&#39;s penchant for wandering the world. The result is a driving roots rock sound, complete with catchy riffs, lyrical hooks and a &#39;feel-good&#39; toe tapping kind of style. Billy&#39;s new release &#39;AllTogetherNow&#39; packages this sound into one beautiful and diverse album, sure to catch the ear of any who hears it. From the anthemic, uptempo lead track &#39;On A Road&#39; and the sweet harmonies of &#39;Hannah&#39;, to the wailin&#39; bluesy rock of &#39;61 Highway&#39; and the summertime pop sounds of &#39;Has Been&#39;, &#39;AllTogetherNow&#39; combines musical ingredients so well, it puts the icing on the rock n&#39; roll cake. Recorded at Orange Lounge Studios and Knob and Tube Studios in Toronto and produced by Chris Wardman (The Watchmen, Randy Bachman) with help from David Gavan Baxter (Justin Rutledge), &#39;Alltogethernow&#39; is music for modern times. In addition to Billy on vocals and guitar, the album showcases the talents of many well-known Canadian musicians, Geoff Hilhorst (Deep Dark Woods) on keys, Erik Allen (Jenny Whiteley) on drums, Mike Filipowitsch on guitar and Jonny Kerr on bass, plus appearances from many others. Penguin Eggs, Canada&#39;s Folk, Roots & World Music Magazine, describes the album as &quot;a powerful roots-rock assault that hits every pop nerve you&#39;ve ever pumped with proteins.&quot; (Eric Thom)Billy Manzik&#39;s music career debuted in Alberta in 2007 with his self-titled release. Recorded at Calgary&#39;s Rocky Mountain Studios by producer Rob Smith with Daniel J. Coe (Aerosmith, The Trews), the album featured musical contributions from Canadian roots music greats Tim Williams, Charlie Hase and Bill Zulak (Crash Test Dummies). &quot;Billy Manzik&quot; received critical acclaim, charting on several !earshot charts and being featured on CBC&#39;s Key of A. In 2008 Billy showcased at the annual Alberta Sessions (Alberta Music Series), broadcast on CBC&#39;s Radio 2, and kicked off the 2008 Juno Awards with a spirited performance at the annual Juno Welcome Reception. In recent years Billy has played with or opened for such luminaries as Blue Rodeo, Elliott Brood, The Trews, Todd Snider, Colin James, The Wailin&#39; Jennys, Gordie Johnson (Big Sugar), Cara Luft, among many others.&quot;Billy Manzik has been a great addition to the Live From the Rock Folk Festival.

They are best known for their 1993 international pop hit \"Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm\". Up to 1999 the band has consisted of Brad Roberts (vocals, guitar), Ellen Reid (keyboards, vocals), Benjamin Darvill (guitar, mandolin), Dan Roberts (bass) and Mitch Dorge (drums). Nowadays Crash Test Dummies has essentialy become a solo project for Brad Roberts, albeit Ellen Reid, Dan Roberts and Mitch Dorge sometimes join him both on record and on stage.\n\nDiscography:\n1991: The Ghosts That Haunt Me\n1993: God Shuffled His Feet\n1996: A Worm's Life\n1999: Give Yourself a Hand\n2001: I Don't Care That You Don't Mind\n2002: Jingle All the Way\n2003: Puss 'n' Boots\n2004: Songs of the Unforgiven\n2010: Oooh La La!\n\nHistory:\nFormed in 1989 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the group quickly signed to a major label and released their debut album, The Ghosts that Haunt Me, on April 5, 1991. An unusual combination of folk-rock stylings with witty and offbeat lyrics and the attention-grabbing voice of vocalist Brad Roberts, the album became one of the year's best-selling records in Canada on the strength of the hit single \"Superman's Song\". It has sold nearly 500,000 copies in Canada, and won that year's Juno Award for Group of the Year.\n\"God Shuffled His Feet\" has been the Crash Test Dummies' most successful album to date\n\nOn October 15, 1993, they released the follow-up, the more polished and matured God Shuffled His Feet. It was also a success, with the first single, \"Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm\", becoming a major pop hit internationally as well as in Canada and parodied by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic under the title \"Headline News\". The title track, \"Afternoons and Coffeespoons\", and \"Swimming in Your Ocean\" were also major hits on the Canadian pop charts, although they didn't follow suit outside of North America. The album would go on to sell nearly six million copies in America, and nearly ten million worldwide.\n\nOn October 2, 1996, A Worm's Life, their most overtly hard guitar-rock album, proved to be the beginning of the end for the band's commercial fortunes, selling poorly compared to its two predecessors and only spawning the minor hits \"He Liked to Feel It\" (with a video featuring a young boy finding ways to pull out his baby teeth) and \"My Own Sunrise\". It ended up selling two or three million copies worldwide.\n\nGive Yourself a Hand, released on March 23, 1999, confirmed this decline -- although it included the Canadian radio hit \"Keep a Lid on Things\", the album's experiments in R&B and electronic dance music garnered the most negative reviews of the band's career, and sold poorly.\n\nThe Crash Test Dummies moved into new territority releasing a mainly Country influenced album entitled I Don't Care That You Don't Mind which marked Brad Roberts return to form after a fairly serious car accident. Jingle All The Way followed which was a re-release of Christmas Carol renditions. In 2003 Puss 'N' Boots was released which harkened back to their original style, but arguably lacked the quirkiness and appeal of the early releases. The band's next release, Songs of the Unforgiven was a very sombre affair with dark lyrics heavily featuring death as the topic over a mostly simple acoustic backing track.\n\nIn 2010, Brad Roberts released Oooh La La under his Crash Test Dummies sobriquet.  Primarily a collaboration with engineer/producer Stewart Lerman, it finds Roberts changing up the band's sound again, often from one track to the next, while maintaining his trademark lyrical quirkiness.  Following the release of this album, Brad Roberts and Ellen Reid toured in the summer/fall of 2010, playing a number of acoustic sets throughout the US.\n\nMany members of the Crash Test Dummies have continued to work in the music industry releasing solo material, possibly most noticeably Ben Darvill who as Son Of Dave tours extensively supporting larger acts such as Supergrass in the UK.\n\nBrad Roberts has since released a solo \"live\" album, under the name Crash test Dude. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Crash+Test+Dummies\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Little; Libretto by Royce Vavrek\n\nSaratoga Springs, NY - Opera Saratoga&#39;s Artistic and General Director Lawrence Edelson announced that the company&#39;s 2018 Summer Festival will feature new productions of four operas at in Spa State Park, along with a wide variety of free and ticketed concert events from May 26 through July 15 at venues throughout the region.\n\nOne of the most popular operettas across the globe, THE MERRY WIDOW returns to Opera Saratoga for the first time in thirty years next summer. Hanna Glawari, the Merry Widow, is beautiful and rich... and she&#39;s captivated every man in the country. But Hanna is looking for true love. Will she be able to find a suitor that is not only after her wealth? Will the nation of Pontevedro slip into economic collapse if she marries a foreigner? Will all those dancing girls prove too distracting for the audience?! Franz Leh\u00e1r&#39;s magical score features the famous &quot;Vilja&quot; song, the &quot;Merry Widow Waltz,&quot; and many more beloved melodies.\u00a0The Merry Widow, which was composed in 1905, ushered in a new era of operettas in which the waltz was used for romantic plot purposes, and was danced as much as sung.\u00a0Opera Saratoga&#39;s new production continues the company&#39;s\u00a0Opera-in-Motion\u00a0initiative, in which dance is prominently integrated into one production each summer.\u00a0The Merry Widow\u00a0will be directed and choreographed by\u00a0John de los Santos, and conducted by\u00a0Anthony Barrese, both making their company debuts. Soprano\u00a0Cecilia Violetta L\u00f3pez\u00a0(Beatrice in\u00a0Il Postino,\u00a02016) returns to star in the title role, alongside the company debut of baritone\u00a0Jonathan Beyer\u00a0as Danilo.\n\u00a0\nWinner of both the New York Drama Critic Circle award as the Best Musical Play and the Pulitzer Prize in Music in 1950,\u00a0THE CONSUL\u00a0is an American masterpiece that ran on Broadway for eight months before premiering at La Scala, followed by productions at opera houses around the globe.\u00a0Olin Downes hailed the Broadway premiere in The New York Times as &quot;a smash hit&quot; and &quot;an opera of eloquence, momentousness, and intensity of expression...written from the heart, with a blazing sincerity and a passion of human understanding... It is torn out of the life of the present-day world, and poses an issue which mercilessly confronts humanity today. And this is done with a new wedding of the English language with music in a way which is singable, intensely dramatic and poetic by turns, and always of beauty.&quot;Almost 70 years later,\u00a0Gian Carlo Menotti&#39;s riveting opera\u00a0still\u00a0delivers a punch as powerful and timely as its subject matter - the struggle for freedom against oppression, and the maddening nature of unrelenting bureaucracy.\u00a0Set in an unnamed European city, political dissident John Sorel is on the run from the secret police. After he escapes the country, his\u00a0devoted wife Magda clashes with the bureaucracy at the Consulate while trying to obtain an exit visa for her family.\u00a0The emotional high point of the opera comes when Magda, thwarted in her quest for a visa, addresses the Consul&#39;s secretary in &quot;To this we&#39;ve come,&quot; a stirring lament over the world&#39;s indifference to inhumanity and suffering.\u00a0The suspenseful narrative surprises with several magical touches and is buoyed by a melodic score in which love, hope, and redemption all play their part.\u00a0\u00a0Last seen at Opera Saratoga (as Lake George Opera) in 1984,\u00a0The Consul\u00a0remains as timely as when it was written, taking on renewed relevance for contemporary audiences. Artistic and General Director\u00a0Lawrence Edelson directs this new production, conducted by\u00a0Andrew Bisantz\u00a0(Le nozze di Figaro, 2016). The production will feature soprano\u00a0Meghan Kasanders, a distinguished alumna of Opera Saratoga&#39;s Young Artist Program, as Magda Sorel, alongside baritone Wes Mason\u00a0as John Sorel, and mezzo soprano\u00a0Deborah Nansteel\u00a0as John&#39;s Mother, both in their company debuts.\n\u00a0\nThe third production of the season will be a double-bill of contemporary operas that revolve around themes of obsession, desire, competition and the need to win as seen through the lens of two very different sports - Thoroughbred Horse Racing, and Finch Sitting!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe first half of the double-bill will be the American Premiere of\u00a0ROCKING HORSE WINNER. This critically acclaimed chamber opera by Gareth Williams and Anna Chatterton received its world premiere last season at Tapestry Opera in Toronto.\u00a0 A modern adaptation of D.H. Lawrence&#39;s short story, Rocking Horse Winner\u00a0explores the relationship between Paul and his emotionally distant mother. Paul becomes dangerously obsessed with solving the &quot;bad luck&quot; of his family in order to win his mother&#39;s love. His pursuit awakens a strange magic that connects him not only to luck, but also to powerful voices only he can hear - voices that tell him which horses will win at the track.\u00a0Rocking Horse Winner\u00a0is an intimate, psychological look at love, &quot;luck&quot;, and greed. The second half of the double-bill will feature the World Premiere of a new chamber version of\u00a0VINKENSPORT, or THE FINCH OPERA.\u00a0Originally commissioned by Dawn Upshaw for the Graduate Vocal Arts Program at the Bard Conservatory, where it premiered in February of 2010, this opera was one of the earliest collaborations between David T. Little and Royce Vavrek, whose critically acclaimed works also include JFK\u00a0and\u00a0Dog Days. Vinkensport\u00a0is a bittersweet comedy in one act that explores the nature of competition and the need to win through the frame of an obscure Flemish folk sport, Finch-Sitting. We see a motley assortment of contestants battle to see who has the most melodious bird. As they compete, the joys, sorrows, delusions and all-too-stark realities of their trainers are revealed. Principal roles in both operas will be cast from members of Opera Saratoga&#39;s nationally acclaimed Young Artist Program - the second oldest mentorship program for emerging opera singers in the country, under the leadership of\u00a0Laurie Rogers. The production will prominently feature these gifted singers as part of Opera Saratoga&#39;s commitment to providing emerging professional artists important performing opportunities to advance their careers.\u00a0The production will be directed by\u00a0Michael Hidetoshi Mori\u00a0in his company debut, and will be conducted by\u00a0Lidiya Yankovskaya\u00a0(Z\u00e9mire et Azor, 2017).\n\u00a0\nIn making the announcement today, Edelson reflected on opera&#39;s ability to captivate diverse audiences through vivid music and compelling stories. &quot;From the enchanting waltzes and flirtatious scheming in\u00a0The Merry Widow, through the striking and timely exploration of human rights in\u00a0The Consul, to the often obsessive and all-encompassing nature of gambling and competition in our double-bill of\u00a0Vinkensport\u00a0and\u00a0Rocking Horse Winner\u00a0- which brings our local passion for Thoroughbred Racing to the opera stage -\u00a0 Opera Saratoga is committed to entertaining, moving, and engaging audiences. In opera, we often see and hear characters who are often very different from ourselves - but just as often, we see ourselves and our world reflected on the stage. We look forward to sharing four very different operas during the 2018 Festival - there truly is something for everyone next summer at Opera Saratoga!&quot;\n\u00a0\nIn addition to the opera productions, Opera Saratoga will present a variety of free and ticketed concerts and master classes from May 26 through July 15\u00a0at venues throughout the region. These events will include two concerts directly connected to the summer operas:\u00a0Vienna, City of My Dreams\u00a0- a concert featuring scenes from operettas by Johann Strauss, Franz Leh\u00e1r, Emmerich K\u00e1lm\u00e1n, Franz von Supp\u00e9, Leo Fall and more; and\u00a0Refugee Voices, a concert of vocal music by composers from different periods of time who were refugees.\n\u00a0\nThe complete performance schedule for the 2018 Summer Festival, along with Subscription Packages, will be available on October 1, 2017.\u00a0\u00a0Single tickets will go on sale February 15, 2018.

The Company now calls Saratoga Springs home and performs for more than 25,000 people annually. Opera Saratoga serves the communities of Saratoga Springs, the Lower Adirondack and New York State Capital areas by providing access to world-class opera through the production of an annual Summer Festival, as well as year-round activities including extensive educational programs, mentorship of emerging operatic artists, and unique opportunities for the public to experience opera in both our home theater and non-traditional venues that leverage and embrace the unique cultural, historic, and natural resources of the area. To date, the Company has performed over 90 different fully-staged works by over 50 different composers, including thirty-five works by American composers and six world-premiere productions. Throughout its history, the Company&#39;s success has been shaped by visionary leaders, talented artists, and critically acclaimed productions. In July 2014, Lawrence Edelson became the Opera Saratoga&#39;s Artistic and General Director. Edelson&#39;s leadership marked a new chapter in the company&#39;s history, with increased emphasis on community partnerships throughout the year, diversification of the company&#39;s repertoire, and a reaffirmed commitment to both the presentation of American opera and the mentorship of emerging artists as core activities in the company&#39;s programs each season. The 2018 Summer Festival will be the fourth season under his leadership.

Little; Libretto by Royce Vavrek\n\nSaratoga Springs, NY - Opera Saratoga&#39;s Artistic and General Director Lawrence Edelson announced that the company&#39;s 2018 Summer Festival will feature new productions of four operas at in Spa State Park, along with a wide variety of free and ticketed concert events from May 26 through July 15 at venues throughout the region.\n\nOne of the most popular operettas across the globe, THE MERRY WIDOW returns to Opera Saratoga for the first time in thirty years next summer. Hanna Glawari, the Merry Widow, is beautiful and rich... and she&#39;s captivated every man in the country. But Hanna is looking for true love. Will she be able to find a suitor that is not only after her wealth? Will the nation of Pontevedro slip into economic collapse if she marries a foreigner? Will all those dancing girls prove too distracting for the audience?! Franz Leh\u00e1r&#39;s magical score features the famous &quot;Vilja&quot; song, the &quot;Merry Widow Waltz,&quot; and many more beloved melodies.\u00a0The Merry Widow, which was composed in 1905, ushered in a new era of operettas in which the waltz was used for romantic plot purposes, and was danced as much as sung.\u00a0Opera Saratoga&#39;s new production continues the company&#39;s\u00a0Opera-in-Motion\u00a0initiative, in which dance is prominently integrated into one production each summer.\u00a0The Merry Widow\u00a0will be directed and choreographed by\u00a0John de los Santos, and conducted by\u00a0Anthony Barrese, both making their company debuts. Soprano\u00a0Cecilia Violetta L\u00f3pez\u00a0(Beatrice in\u00a0Il Postino,\u00a02016) returns to star in the title role, alongside the company debut of baritone\u00a0Jonathan Beyer\u00a0as Danilo.\n\u00a0\nWinner of both the New York Drama Critic Circle award as the Best Musical Play and the Pulitzer Prize in Music in 1950,\u00a0THE CONSUL\u00a0is an American masterpiece that ran on Broadway for eight months before premiering at La Scala, followed by productions at opera houses around the globe.\u00a0Olin Downes hailed the Broadway premiere in The New York Times as &quot;a smash hit&quot; and &quot;an opera of eloquence, momentousness, and intensity of expression...written from the heart, with a blazing sincerity and a passion of human understanding... It is torn out of the life of the present-day world, and poses an issue which mercilessly confronts humanity today. And this is done with a new wedding of the English language with music in a way which is singable, intensely dramatic and poetic by turns, and always of beauty.&quot;Almost 70 years later,\u00a0Gian Carlo Menotti&#39;s riveting opera\u00a0still\u00a0delivers a punch as powerful and timely as its subject matter - the struggle for freedom against oppression, and the maddening nature of unrelenting bureaucracy.\u00a0Set in an unnamed European city, political dissident John Sorel is on the run from the secret police. After he escapes the country, his\u00a0devoted wife Magda clashes with the bureaucracy at the Consulate while trying to obtain an exit visa for her family.\u00a0The emotional high point of the opera comes when Magda, thwarted in her quest for a visa, addresses the Consul&#39;s secretary in &quot;To this we&#39;ve come,&quot; a stirring lament over the world&#39;s indifference to inhumanity and suffering.\u00a0The suspenseful narrative surprises with several magical touches and is buoyed by a melodic score in which love, hope, and redemption all play their part.\u00a0\u00a0Last seen at Opera Saratoga (as Lake George Opera) in 1984,\u00a0The Consul\u00a0remains as timely as when it was written, taking on renewed relevance for contemporary audiences. Artistic and General Director\u00a0Lawrence Edelson directs this new production, conducted by\u00a0Andrew Bisantz\u00a0(Le nozze di Figaro, 2016). The production will feature soprano\u00a0Meghan Kasanders, a distinguished alumna of Opera Saratoga&#39;s Young Artist Program, as Magda Sorel, alongside baritone Wes Mason\u00a0as John Sorel, and mezzo soprano\u00a0Deborah Nansteel\u00a0as John&#39;s Mother, both in their company debuts.\n\u00a0\nThe third production of the season will be a double-bill of contemporary operas that revolve around themes of obsession, desire, competition and the need to win as seen through the lens of two very different sports - Thoroughbred Horse Racing, and Finch Sitting!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe first half of the double-bill will be the American Premiere of\u00a0ROCKING HORSE WINNER. This critically acclaimed chamber opera by Gareth Williams and Anna Chatterton received its world premiere last season at Tapestry Opera in Toronto.\u00a0 A modern adaptation of D.H. Lawrence&#39;s short story, Rocking Horse Winner\u00a0explores the relationship between Paul and his emotionally distant mother. Paul becomes dangerously obsessed with solving the &quot;bad luck&quot; of his family in order to win his mother&#39;s love. His pursuit awakens a strange magic that connects him not only to luck, but also to powerful voices only he can hear - voices that tell him which horses will win at the track.\u00a0Rocking Horse Winner\u00a0is an intimate, psychological look at love, &quot;luck&quot;, and greed. The second half of the double-bill will feature the World Premiere of a new chamber version of\u00a0VINKENSPORT, or THE FINCH OPERA.\u00a0Originally commissioned by Dawn Upshaw for the Graduate Vocal Arts Program at the Bard Conservatory, where it premiered in February of 2010, this opera was one of the earliest collaborations between David T. Little and Royce Vavrek, whose critically acclaimed works also include JFK\u00a0and\u00a0Dog Days. Vinkensport\u00a0is a bittersweet comedy in one act that explores the nature of competition and the need to win through the frame of an obscure Flemish folk sport, Finch-Sitting. We see a motley assortment of contestants battle to see who has the most melodious bird. As they compete, the joys, sorrows, delusions and all-too-stark realities of their trainers are revealed. Principal roles in both operas will be cast from members of Opera Saratoga&#39;s nationally acclaimed Young Artist Program - the second oldest mentorship program for emerging opera singers in the country, under the leadership of\u00a0Laurie Rogers. The production will prominently feature these gifted singers as part of Opera Saratoga&#39;s commitment to providing emerging professional artists important performing opportunities to advance their careers.\u00a0The production will be directed by\u00a0Michael Hidetoshi Mori\u00a0in his company debut, and will be conducted by\u00a0Lidiya Yankovskaya\u00a0(Z\u00e9mire et Azor, 2017).\n\u00a0\nIn making the announcement today, Edelson reflected on opera&#39;s ability to captivate diverse audiences through vivid music and compelling stories. &quot;From the enchanting waltzes and flirtatious scheming in\u00a0The Merry Widow, through the striking and timely exploration of human rights in\u00a0The Consul, to the often obsessive and all-encompassing nature of gambling and competition in our double-bill of\u00a0Vinkensport\u00a0and\u00a0Rocking Horse Winner\u00a0- which brings our local passion for Thoroughbred Racing to the opera stage -\u00a0 Opera Saratoga is committed to entertaining, moving, and engaging audiences. In opera, we often see and hear characters who are often very different from ourselves - but just as often, we see ourselves and our world reflected on the stage. We look forward to sharing four very different operas during the 2018 Festival - there truly is something for everyone next summer at Opera Saratoga!&quot;\n\u00a0\nIn addition to the opera productions, Opera Saratoga will present a variety of free and ticketed concerts and master classes from May 26 through July 15\u00a0at venues throughout the region. These events will include two concerts directly connected to the summer operas:\u00a0Vienna, City of My Dreams\u00a0- a concert featuring scenes from operettas by Johann Strauss, Franz Leh\u00e1r, Emmerich K\u00e1lm\u00e1n, Franz von Supp\u00e9, Leo Fall and more; and\u00a0Refugee Voices, a concert of vocal music by composers from different periods of time who were refugees.\n\u00a0\nThe complete performance schedule for the 2018 Summer Festival, along with Subscription Packages, will be available on October 1, 2017.\u00a0\u00a0Single tickets will go on sale February 15, 2018.

Hanna Glawari, the Merry Widow, is beautiful and rich... and she&#39;s captivated every man in the country. But Hanna is looking for true love. Will she be able to find a suitor that is not only after her wealth? Will the nation of Pontevedro slip into economic collapse if she marries a foreigner? Will all those dancing girls prove too distracting for the audience?! Franz Leh\u00e1r&#39;s magical score features the famous &quot;Vilja&quot; song, the &quot;Merry Widow Waltz,&quot; and many more beloved melodies.\u00a0The Merry Widow, which was composed in 1905, ushered in a new era of operettas in which the waltz was used for romantic plot purposes, and was danced as much as sung.\u00a0Opera Saratoga&#39;s new production continues the company&#39;s\u00a0Opera-in-Motion\u00a0initiative, in which dance is prominently integrated into one production each summer.\u00a0The Merry Widow\u00a0will be directed and choreographed by\u00a0John de los Santos, and conducted by\u00a0Anthony Barrese, both making their company debuts.

It is torn out of the life of the present-day world, and poses an issue which mercilessly confronts humanity today. And this is done with a new wedding of the English language with music in a way which is singable, intensely dramatic and poetic by turns, and always of beauty.&quot;Almost 70 years later,\u00a0Gian Carlo Menotti&#39;s riveting opera\u00a0still\u00a0delivers a punch as powerful and timely as its subject matter - the struggle for freedom against oppression, and the maddening nature of unrelenting bureaucracy.\u00a0Set in an unnamed European city, political dissident John Sorel is on the run from the secret police. After he escapes the country, his\u00a0devoted wife Magda clashes with the bureaucracy at the Consulate while trying to obtain an exit visa for her family.\u00a0The emotional high point of the opera comes when Magda, thwarted in her quest for a visa, addresses the Consul&#39;s secretary in &quot;To this we&#39;ve come,&quot; a stirring lament over the world&#39;s indifference to inhumanity and suffering.\u00a0The suspenseful narrative surprises with several magical touches and is buoyed by a melodic score in which love, hope, and redemption all play their part.\u00a0\u00a0Last seen at Opera Saratoga (as Lake George Opera) in 1984,\u00a0The Consul\u00a0remains as timely as when it was written, taking on renewed relevance for contemporary audiences. Artistic and General Director\u00a0Lawrence Edelson directs this new production, conducted by\u00a0Andrew Bisantz\u00a0(Le nozze di Figaro, 2016). The production will feature soprano\u00a0Meghan Kasanders, a distinguished alumna of Opera Saratoga&#39;s Young Artist Program, as Magda Sorel, alongside baritone Wes Mason\u00a0as John Sorel, and mezzo soprano\u00a0Deborah Nansteel\u00a0as John&#39;s Mother, both in their company debuts.\n\u00a0\nThe third production of the season will be a double-bill of contemporary operas that revolve around themes of obsession, desire, competition and the need to win as seen through the lens of two very different sports - Thoroughbred Horse Racing, and Finch Sitting!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe first half of the double-bill will be the American Premiere of\u00a0ROCKING HORSE WINNER. This critically acclaimed chamber opera by Gareth Williams and Anna Chatterton received its world premiere last season at Tapestry Opera in Toronto.\u00a0 A modern adaptation of D.H. Lawrence&#39;s short story, Rocking Horse Winner\u00a0explores the relationship between Paul and his emotionally distant mother. Paul becomes dangerously obsessed with solving the &quot;bad luck&quot; of his family in order to win his mother&#39;s love. His pursuit awakens a strange magic that connects him not only to luck, but also to powerful voices only he can hear - voices that tell him which horses will win at the track.\u00a0Rocking Horse Winner\u00a0is an intimate, psychological look at love, &quot;luck&quot;, and greed. The second half of the double-bill will feature the World Premiere of a new chamber version of\u00a0VINKENSPORT, or THE FINCH OPERA.\u00a0Originally commissioned by Dawn Upshaw for the Graduate Vocal Arts Program at the Bard Conservatory, where it premiered in February of 2010, this opera was one of the earliest collaborations between David T. Little and Royce Vavrek, whose critically acclaimed works also include JFK\u00a0and\u00a0Dog Days. Vinkensport\u00a0is a bittersweet comedy in one act that explores the nature of competition and the need to win through the frame of an obscure Flemish folk sport, Finch-Sitting. We see a motley assortment of contestants battle to see who has the most melodious bird. As they compete, the joys, sorrows, delusions and all-too-stark realities of their trainers are revealed. Principal roles in both operas will be cast from members of Opera Saratoga&#39;s nationally acclaimed Young Artist Program - the second oldest mentorship program for emerging opera singers in the country, under the leadership of\u00a0Laurie Rogers. The production will prominently feature these gifted singers as part of Opera Saratoga&#39;s commitment to providing emerging professional artists important performing opportunities to advance their careers.\u00a0The production will be directed by\u00a0Michael Hidetoshi Mori\u00a0in his company debut, and will be conducted by\u00a0Lidiya Yankovskaya\u00a0(Z\u00e9mire et Azor, 2017).\n\u00a0\nIn making the announcement today, Edelson reflected on opera&#39;s ability to captivate diverse audiences through vivid music and compelling stories. &quot;From the enchanting waltzes and flirtatious scheming in\u00a0The Merry Widow, through the striking and timely exploration of human rights in\u00a0The Consul, to the often obsessive and all-encompassing nature of gambling and competition in our double-bill of\u00a0Vinkensport\u00a0and\u00a0Rocking Horse Winner\u00a0- which brings our local passion for Thoroughbred Racing to the opera stage -\u00a0 Opera Saratoga is committed to entertaining, moving, and engaging audiences. In opera, we often see and hear characters who are often very different from ourselves - but just as often, we see ourselves and our world reflected on the stage. We look forward to sharing four very different operas during the 2018 Festival - there truly is something for everyone next summer at Opera Saratoga!&quot;\n\u00a0\nIn addition to the opera productions, Opera Saratoga will present a variety of free and ticketed concerts and master classes from May 26 through July 15\u00a0at venues throughout the region. These events will include two concerts directly connected to the summer operas:\u00a0Vienna, City of My Dreams\u00a0- a concert featuring scenes from operettas by Johann Strauss, Franz Leh\u00e1r, Emmerich K\u00e1lm\u00e1n, Franz von Supp\u00e9, Leo Fall and more; and\u00a0Refugee Voices, a concert of vocal music by composers from different periods of time who were refugees.\n\u00a0\nThe complete performance schedule for the 2018 Summer Festival, along with Subscription Packages, will be available on October 1, 2017.\u00a0\u00a0Single tickets will go on sale February 15, 2018.

The Company now calls Saratoga Springs home and performs for more than 25,000 people annually. Opera Saratoga serves the communities of Saratoga Springs, the Lower Adirondack and New York State Capital areas by providing access to world-class opera through the production of an annual Summer Festival, as well as year-round activities including extensive educational programs, mentorship of emerging operatic artists, and unique opportunities for the public to experience opera in both our home theater and non-traditional venues that leverage and embrace the unique cultural, historic, and natural resources of the area.

Little; Libretto by Royce Vavrek\n\nSaratoga Springs, NY - Opera Saratoga&#39;s Artistic and General Director Lawrence Edelson announced that the company&#39;s 2018 Summer Festival will feature new productions of four operas at in Spa State Park, along with a wide variety of free and ticketed concert events from May 26 through July 15 at venues throughout the region.\n\nOne of the most popular operettas across the globe, THE MERRY WIDOW returns to Opera Saratoga for the first time in thirty years next summer. Hanna Glawari, the Merry Widow, is beautiful and rich... and she&#39;s captivated every man in the country. But Hanna is looking for true love. Will she be able to find a suitor that is not only after her wealth? Will the nation of Pontevedro slip into economic collapse if she marries a foreigner? Will all those dancing girls prove too distracting for the audience?! Franz Leh\u00e1r&#39;s magical score features the famous &quot;Vilja&quot; song, the &quot;Merry Widow Waltz,&quot; and many more beloved melodies.\u00a0The Merry Widow, which was composed in 1905, ushered in a new era of operettas in which the waltz was used for romantic plot purposes, and was danced as much as sung.\u00a0Opera Saratoga&#39;s new production continues the company&#39;s\u00a0Opera-in-Motion\u00a0initiative, in which dance is prominently integrated into one production each summer.\u00a0The Merry Widow\u00a0will be directed and choreographed by\u00a0John de los Santos, and conducted by\u00a0Anthony Barrese, both making their company debuts. Soprano\u00a0Cecilia Violetta L\u00f3pez\u00a0(Beatrice in\u00a0Il Postino,\u00a02016) returns to star in the title role, alongside the company debut of baritone\u00a0Jonathan Beyer\u00a0as Danilo.\n\u00a0\nWinner of both the New York Drama Critic Circle award as the Best Musical Play and the Pulitzer Prize in Music in 1950,\u00a0THE CONSUL\u00a0is an American masterpiece that ran on Broadway for eight months before premiering at La Scala, followed by productions at opera houses around the globe.\u00a0Olin Downes hailed the Broadway premiere in The New York Times as &quot;a smash hit&quot; and &quot;an opera of eloquence, momentousness, and intensity of expression...written from the heart, with a blazing sincerity and a passion of human understanding... It is torn out of the life of the present-day world, and poses an issue which mercilessly confronts humanity today. And this is done with a new wedding of the English language with music in a way which is singable, intensely dramatic and poetic by turns, and always of beauty.&quot;Almost 70 years later,\u00a0Gian Carlo Menotti&#39;s riveting opera\u00a0still\u00a0delivers a punch as powerful and timely as its subject matter - the struggle for freedom against oppression, and the maddening nature of unrelenting bureaucracy.\u00a0Set in an unnamed European city, political dissident John Sorel is on the run from the secret police. After he escapes the country, his\u00a0devoted wife Magda clashes with the bureaucracy at the Consulate while trying to obtain an exit visa for her family.\u00a0The emotional high point of the opera comes when Magda, thwarted in her quest for a visa, addresses the Consul&#39;s secretary in &quot;To this we&#39;ve come,&quot; a stirring lament over the world&#39;s indifference to inhumanity and suffering.\u00a0The suspenseful narrative surprises with several magical touches and is buoyed by a melodic score in which love, hope, and redemption all play their part.\u00a0\u00a0Last seen at Opera Saratoga (as Lake George Opera) in 1984,\u00a0The Consul\u00a0remains as timely as when it was written, taking on renewed relevance for contemporary audiences. Artistic and General Director\u00a0Lawrence Edelson directs this new production, conducted by\u00a0Andrew Bisantz\u00a0(Le nozze di Figaro, 2016). The production will feature soprano\u00a0Meghan Kasanders, a distinguished alumna of Opera Saratoga&#39;s Young Artist Program, as Magda Sorel, alongside baritone Wes Mason\u00a0as John Sorel, and mezzo soprano\u00a0Deborah Nansteel\u00a0as John&#39;s Mother, both in their company debuts.\n\u00a0\nThe third production of the season will be a double-bill of contemporary operas that revolve around themes of obsession, desire, competition and the need to win as seen through the lens of two very different sports - Thoroughbred Horse Racing, and Finch Sitting!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe first half of the double-bill will be the American Premiere of\u00a0ROCKING HORSE WINNER. This critically acclaimed chamber opera by Gareth Williams and Anna Chatterton received its world premiere last season at Tapestry Opera in Toronto.\u00a0 A modern adaptation of D.H. Lawrence&#39;s short story, Rocking Horse Winner\u00a0explores the relationship between Paul and his emotionally distant mother. Paul becomes dangerously obsessed with solving the &quot;bad luck&quot; of his family in order to win his mother&#39;s love. His pursuit awakens a strange magic that connects him not only to luck, but also to powerful voices only he can hear - voices that tell him which horses will win at the track.\u00a0Rocking Horse Winner\u00a0is an intimate, psychological look at love, &quot;luck&quot;, and greed. The second half of the double-bill will feature the World Premiere of a new chamber version of\u00a0VINKENSPORT, or THE FINCH OPERA.\u00a0Originally commissioned by Dawn Upshaw for the Graduate Vocal Arts Program at the Bard Conservatory, where it premiered in February of 2010, this opera was one of the earliest collaborations between David T. Little and Royce Vavrek, whose critically acclaimed works also include JFK\u00a0and\u00a0Dog Days. Vinkensport\u00a0is a bittersweet comedy in one act that explores the nature of competition and the need to win through the frame of an obscure Flemish folk sport, Finch-Sitting. We see a motley assortment of contestants battle to see who has the most melodious bird. As they compete, the joys, sorrows, delusions and all-too-stark realities of their trainers are revealed. Principal roles in both operas will be cast from members of Opera Saratoga&#39;s nationally acclaimed Young Artist Program - the second oldest mentorship program for emerging opera singers in the country, under the leadership of\u00a0Laurie Rogers. The production will prominently feature these gifted singers as part of Opera Saratoga&#39;s commitment to providing emerging professional artists important performing opportunities to advance their careers.\u00a0The production will be directed by\u00a0Michael Hidetoshi Mori\u00a0in his company debut, and will be conducted by\u00a0Lidiya Yankovskaya\u00a0(Z\u00e9mire et Azor, 2017).\n\u00a0\nIn making the announcement today, Edelson reflected on opera&#39;s ability to captivate diverse audiences through vivid music and compelling stories. &quot;From the enchanting waltzes and flirtatious scheming in\u00a0The Merry Widow, through the striking and timely exploration of human rights in\u00a0The Consul, to the often obsessive and all-encompassing nature of gambling and competition in our double-bill of\u00a0Vinkensport\u00a0and\u00a0Rocking Horse Winner\u00a0- which brings our local passion for Thoroughbred Racing to the opera stage -\u00a0 Opera Saratoga is committed to entertaining, moving, and engaging audiences. In opera, we often see and hear characters who are often very different from ourselves - but just as often, we see ourselves and our world reflected on the stage. We look forward to sharing four very different operas during the 2018 Festival - there truly is something for everyone next summer at Opera Saratoga!&quot;\n\u00a0\nIn addition to the opera productions, Opera Saratoga will present a variety of free and ticketed concerts and master classes from May 26 through July 15\u00a0at venues throughout the region. These events will include two concerts directly connected to the summer operas:\u00a0Vienna, City of My Dreams\u00a0- a concert featuring scenes from operettas by Johann Strauss, Franz Leh\u00e1r, Emmerich K\u00e1lm\u00e1n, Franz von Supp\u00e9, Leo Fall and more; and\u00a0Refugee Voices, a concert of vocal music by composers from different periods of time who were refugees.\n\u00a0\nThe complete performance schedule for the 2018 Summer Festival, along with Subscription Packages, will be available on October 1, 2017.\u00a0\u00a0Single tickets will go on sale February 15, 2018.

The Company now calls Saratoga Springs home and performs for more than 25,000 people annually. Opera Saratoga serves the communities of Saratoga Springs, the Lower Adirondack and New York State Capital areas by providing access to world-class opera through the production of an annual Summer Festival, as well as year-round activities including extensive educational programs, mentorship of emerging operatic artists, and unique opportunities for the public to experience opera in both our home theater and non-traditional venues that leverage and embrace the unique cultural, historic, and natural resources of the area. To date, the Company has performed over 90 different fully-staged works by over 50 different composers, including thirty-five works by American composers and six world-premiere productions. Throughout its history, the Company&#39;s success has been shaped by visionary leaders, talented artists, and critically acclaimed productions. In July 2014, Lawrence Edelson became the Opera Saratoga&#39;s Artistic and General Director. Edelson&#39;s leadership marked a new chapter in the company&#39;s history, with increased emphasis on community partnerships throughout the year, diversification of the company&#39;s repertoire, and a reaffirmed commitment to both the presentation of American opera and the mentorship of emerging artists as core activities in the company&#39;s programs each season. The 2018 Summer Festival will be the fourth season under his leadership.

DeNicola  and F. Previte for the iconic 'Dirty Dancing' soundtrack). The former, a smooth ballad, was penned by Carmen based on a classical theme by Sergei Rachmaninoff. It was more recently covered by Celine Dion and also used in the opening scene of the movie 'Bridget Jones' Diary'.\n\nBesides his successful solo career, Carmen's also known as one of the rock n rollers behind the Cleveland, Ohio based band The Raspberries. As lead vocalist and co-songwriter, he helped the group gain big popularity in the 70s through arena-ready hits such as \"Go All the Way\" and \"Tonight\", with the band becoming a cult figure among power pop fans. Carmen reunited with Raspberries producer Jimmy Ienner to be a part of the 'Dirty Dancing' soundtrack, a commercial juggernaut that achieved massive success and was RIAA certified multi-platinum. Carmen's song \"Hungry Eyes\" reached the top 40 charts in Canada, Germany, the U.S., and elsewhere while attracting critical acclaim. Over the years, Carmen's work has been praised by many of his fellow musicians including Bruce Springsteen and Ringo Starr among others. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Carmen\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

grandpa died\nI read it in the paper, caught me by surprise.\n\nMade me think of when I lost mine\nWhen I asked you said that you were fine.\n\nAnd I would not be surprised to find\nYou'd forgotten my name by now.\n\nNo I could not see, as time went by\nMy shadow fading out.\n\nTough as nails, I tested all the time\nI make my bed, and then I lie.\n\nI try to say, what's mine is mine\nBut its just another story line.\n\nI've tried to think, what happened to the fire\nIt's burning out, made me into a lier.\n\nMade me feel like I'd been shooting shadows\nLetting all that really mattered go.\n\nAnd I would not be surprised to find\nYou'd forgotten my name by now.\n\nNo I could not see, as time went by\nMy shadow fading out.", "youtube": {"duration": 244, "date_published": "2015-06-05

Last years Busted Jukebox, Volume 1 was a collaborative collection of covers featuring such top talents as the Milk Carton Kids, Lucius, JD McPherson and Butch Walker.On the new release, Trent and Hearst as ever play all the instruments and penned the material, which range from stomping rockers to delicate acoustic-based numbers. Many of Little Seeds finely crafted and reflective new songs completed in the late summer of 2015 are drawn from tumultuous events experienced by the couple over the course of the last two years.There were two major changes that happened at the same time, Hearst says. We found out we were pregnant, and at the same time Michaels parents had been living with us, because his father is in the early stages of Alzheimers. Those two things, having the baby and facing the reality that our parents were aging, made this weird, awesome circle of humanity that really just took us out. I guess we were in the crosshairs of human existence. Trent continues, We started putting this record together right after the baby was born. Every spare moment I had I was in the studio doing my best to work around the cries, and Cary would have to sneak up and do her parts when the baby was asleep. Its a funny thing trying to make a rock n roll record with a sleeping baby in the house.Hearst adds, As we were finishing the record and making the final decisions about what to include in it, our good friend Eric was killed here in town. We ended up dedicating the record to his memory. The beginning of This Ride is actually Erics mother telling the true story of how he had been born in the back of a police car. With her blessing, we added that to frame This Ride.Invisible Man and Mourning Song, were directly inspired by the debilitating illness faced by Trents father. Hearst says of the former song, The disease is preventing him from being able to mentally wrap his mind around it. I wanted to speak for him. I wanted to express what it would be like for a man like him, a capable, funny dude. I wanted to put that in an up-tempo pop song, because its always interesting for dark material to be presented that way.Of Mourning Song, Trent says, I was envisioning what it was going to be like for my mother after he wasnt around anymore. Its weird, maybe, to write a song about the death of your father who hasnt died yet. It seemed like something he would do write a tune to comfort my mother after hes gone.The hushed, moving spoken word BWYR, a song of unity at a time when some try to divide, is torn from an event close to home: the mass shootings at Charlestons Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in June 2015.The night we heard about it, we were in Denver and approaching the end of touring while pregnant, which was pretty intense, Trent says. We flew to Chicago, our show was cancelled it was rained out and we were stuck in the hotel, and thats where it was written. We were talking to our friends and texting, and we wanted to be home so bad, to be with our people. These mass shootings seemed to be happening every weekend, and the thought of bringing a child into the world was overwhelming and scary.Buffalo Nickel takes on the most personal of all subjects: Trent and Hearsts relationship as a married couple who also collaborate creatively. Only as the song developed did they begin to understand its topic. We were trying to figure out what the story was about, Trent says, and the more we wrote on it, we said, Are we talking about us here? Are we airing some things here? Without a beat, Hearst adds with a laugh, And we were.Little Seeds also contains songs that deploy Shovels and Ropes widely admired talents as storytellers: the thrashing I Know, a wryly observed description of intra-band backbiting, and Botched Execution, a darkly funny tale of a convict on the run in the manner of Southern gothic writer Flannery OConnor. Inspired by a concise history written by Hearsts father, Missionary Ridge looks back at the decisive 1863 Civil War battle.The album also tips a hat to the groups Americana forebears. The Last Hawk pays homage to Garth Hudson, the master keyboardist of the Band, who Hearst calls a quiet genius, this weird, wonderful creature who can do anything with music. Trent recalls, There was an article in Rolling Stone that was one of the first things youd ever seen where it was just Garth, explaining things from his take. We read it on an airplane, and I looked over at Cary, and she was crying it really moved her.Both Trent and Hearst acknowledge that making Little Seeds took the band into previously unexplored and even unimagined creative terrain.It was cathartic, says Trent. There were some songs we had trouble getting through because it was too emotional for us. Thats not really how we had approached songwriting in the past we got really into writing character-based songs on Swimmin Time. For Little Seeds, this is what was going on, and it was all consuming, physically and emotionally, and I feel like we couldnt help but to be very raw and honest.Hearst says, At a certain point in your relationship, professional or personal, you think its maybe run its course We cant possibly write more together than we have in the past. We cant possibly live closer than we have in the past. We cant possibly understand each other more. But in the last couple of years, that has happened.

Hollis Peach weaves evocative, mischievous and deeply personal stories in the American vernacular of song and story. This unassuming, yet highly original duo is currently touring in promotion of their debut release, Sometimes We Feel the Same. Founding members of the rootsy folk orchestra Patchy Sanders, songwriter and guitarist, Dan Sherrill along with his singing partner, Jacqui Aubert, create a finely nuanced musical pairing. Though deceptively simple, their musical arrangements and harmonies are lush, intricate, and often hypnotic in their elegance. Kenneth Pattengale, of the Grammy-nominated The Milk Carton Kids, describes Dan as, a monster guitar player. And this is true, as Dans phrasing comes out in the cleverest and subtlest of ways. When all is said and done, Hollis Peachs music is a powerhouse of subtle gestures and graceful storytelling. Beautiful harmony, wonderfully intimate song-writing and performance.

The duo have enjoyed intently listening audiences across the country and abroad in their respective solo careers, but an even greater sense of urgency and demand of attention is palpable now that they've come together as The Milk Carton Kids. Their songs are written together, but you won't know there is more than one author. \u00a0Their history together spans only one short year, but you won't know that either. They stand close together when they play, facing each other and using microphones instead of plugging their guitars in. And if they looked more alike, they'd fool you that they were brothers.\n\nTheir songs disguise the youth of the members of the band. Befittingly, so do the old guitars they play and old clothing they wear. But to be sure, The Milk Carton Kids have something new to present: harmonies & minimalist instrumentation which are a clear reference to times passed, but with an eye intently on the future; a perspective on coming-of-age in the eye of a present-day storm; and the chronicling of an American struggle for simplicity, at least musically. To present it they use two guitars and two voices, they labor over the arrangements, they record themselves live, and they release their music on their own label, and for free.\n\nAs solo artists they have 10 releases between them. As a band their career is off to an auspicious start. Starting from a highly regarded position among their peers, they've opened for the art-piano-pop critical darling Vienna Teng, Grammy nominated friend and fan Sara Bareilles, and now will take to the entire U.S. and Canada this summer supporting one of the consummate songwriters of their generation, Joe Purdy. Despite the decision to stick to acoustic guitars in their own show, both Ryan and Pattengale are multi-instrumentalists and will also comprise Purdy's backing band, joining him on bass, pedal steel guitar, piano, and harmonies.\n\nTheir first collaborative release, RETROSPECT, is a live album due out March 15th, 2011, that represents the culmination of the past year of live performance. A collection of songs from each of their solo careers, written separately but reinterpreted and performed as the duo now called The Milk Carton Kids, RETROSPECT will be released under the name \"Kenneth Pattengale & Joey Ryan\".\n\nThe first official release of The Milk Carton Kids, entitled PROLOGUE, comprised of original songs written by the duo for this project. It was released in 2011 on their own Milk Carton Records. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Milk+Carton+Kids\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Its B-side is Crying Shame. The song has been available online since 9 May following a radio premiere the previous day. The single reached #4 in the UK Singles Chart, making it the highest charting single by the band to date. The track was mixed at Townhouse Studios, London. It was released as the third U.S. single on April 23, 2007.\n\nInfluences\n\nThe song showcases the album's experimentation with other genres. \"It's the most different to anything we've ever done,\" Matthew Bellamy told French magazine Rock Mag on 3 March 2006, \"We've had some Belgian influences: Millionaire, dEUS, Evil Superstars, Soulwax... These groups were the first to mix R&B rhythms with alternative guitar. We've added a bit of Prince and Kanye West. The drumbeat isn't rocky, with Rage Against the Machine riffs underneath. We\u2019ve mixed a lot of things in this track, with a bit of electronica; it\u2019s different, slow, quite funky.\"\n\nSpeaking about the album with NME, Bellamy said, \"I was going out dancing in clubs around New York. That helped create tracks like \"Supermassive Black Hole\". Franz Ferdinand would have done it very well, with that dance type beat going on mixed with alternative guitar and I've always wanted to find that.\"\n\nThe different style has met mixed reactions, and resulted in numerous comparisons, often tongue-in-cheek, of the main riff to those of Cameo's 1986 single Word Up! and Britney Spears' 2004 Do Somethin'.\n\nMusic video\n\nThe single's accompanying promotional video shows the band playing in a small furniture shop, clad in masks. This is intercut with images of dancers in Zentai suits which are then unzipped at the end to reveal beings made of space. The video was shot by Floria Sigismondi, who is also known for directing music videos for bands such as Marilyn Manson, The White Stripes, Interpol and The Cure.\n\nRemixes and covers\n\nThe \"Phones Control Voltage mix\" of the song was released as the B-side on the vinyl single of Starlight. On the game FIFA 07 there was also an alternative version of the song, which features slightly different guitar and vocals to the original.\n\nThe song was covered by English Progressive metal band Threshold on the limited edition digipak of their 2007 album Dead Reckoning.\n\nChart performance\n\nThe song has been one of their most successful. It gave them their highest singles chart entry, selling 24,104 in its first week (downloads and physical). In total it has sold over 85,000 and was the 84th best selling song of 2006 in the UK.\n\nThe song went for adds on US radio at the end of April 2007. Its early supporters were S021 (Sirius Satellite Radio), KITS (San Francisco), and WFNX (Boston). By mid-May, many stations, including WBTZ (Burlington, Vermont), KJEE (Santa Barbara), S021, and WFNX, were supporting it. The song reached #6 on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart, making it the second highest charting Muse single in the US behind \"Starlight\". By early June, it was supported by 41 US alternative rock stations and also grew to receive major support from WEQX (Albany, New York) and WHTG (Monmouth/Ocean, New Jersey). By late July, support for the song had spread to 63 US alternative rock stations, with this number rising to 72 by mid-August.\n\n\nThis song was made available as downloadable content for Guitar Hero 3.\n\nThis song was featured in the 2008 movie, 'Twilight' based on the books by Stephanie Meyer. It is also available on the widely popular soundtrack for that movie.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Muse/_/Supermassive+Black+Hole\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Get Muse's album BLACK HOLES & REVELATIONS here: http://smarturl.it/getmuseblackholes http://muse.mu http://instagram.com/muse http://twitter.com/muse..."}, "description": "\"Starlight\" is a song by British alternative rock band Muse and is the second track on their 2006 album Black Holes and Revelations. It was released on 4 September 2006 in the United Kingdom as the second single from Black Holes and Revelations. The song peaked at #13 on the UK Singles Chart. It was also the second single released in the United States, reaching number two on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was first played live during the Radio 1's Big Weekend festival in summer 2006. In live performances \"Starlight\" is usually played half a step down from the key of B used on Black Holes & Revelations.\n\n\"Starlight\" was first written in the band's practice studio in late 2004. Bassist Chris Wolstenholme said that it is \"a love song about missing someone, friends, family, someone you love.\" Lead singer Matt Bellamy commented that he first wrote the song on a boat in bad weather.\n\nIn a separate interview with Tom Wilson and Lara Mathews, posted on MuseLive Forums, Wolstenholme was asked what he thought \"was the hardest song on the album to record?\" His response was \"Starlight,\" stating it \"was one of the songs we went around in circles with, and we recorded maybe six or seven different versions of it.\"\n\nAn alternative mix of \"Starlight\", known as the \"New Mix, \"Radio Mix\" or \"Radio Version\" was distributed on promotional media only. This version was presumably created to give the song a sound more suitable for radio broadcast.\n\nMuse worked with Paul Minor on Starlight's music video, which was filmed in Los Angeles. In the video, the band perform on the deck of the MS Ocean Chie, a handysize bulk carrier. Band members are also carrying flares, in an attempt to \"get rescued,\" but in the end this fails and they are abandoned. This relates to the song's lyrics, which mentions ships and abandonment.\n\nMatthew Bellamy stated in an interview with The Sunday Mail that the band wanted to \"create the idea of a band lost at sea because we see ourselves as being outside what's happening in the music scene.\" He also told the interviewer, Billy Sloan, that \"it was an epic feeling playing on a huge platform with the sea all around us.\"\n\n\"Starlight\" received mixed critical reviews, from various publishers.\n\nNME's review was harshly critical of the song, with the reviewer stating that the song \"is a tune so chart-hungry it's virtually dry-humping JK and Joel's legs.\"\n\nMusicOMH stated that the song was \"a track perfectly at home on drivetime radio\" while saying it \"showcases another side to the band's music and their staggering breadth of appeal.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Leeds Music Scene reviewer Maria Pinto-Fernandes gave \"Starlight\" a glowing review, with a score of 4.5 stars out of 5. In her review, she commented that \"the band's musical arrangements on the track do not come into being just by accident.\" She also stated that the song was just as passionate when performed live as when heard on CD.\n\n\"Starlight\" entered the UK Singles Chart the week of September 3 at number 38 via digital downloads. The following week, and with the physical release in the United Kingdom, the single peaked at number 13. Since then, the single's chart position steadily declined, and it remained in the Top 75 after fifteen weeks, during the week of December 11, 2006. The next week, \"Starlight\" had fallen out of the Top 75.\n\n\"Starlight\" has also peaked at number two on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks chart, Muse's second highest charting single to date on any major chart in the US. It also charted in at number nine on the Triple J Hottest 100, 2006. It was also ranked at number four on Colombian radio station Radi\u00f3nica's 2006 top 100. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Muse/_/Starlight\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released as the lead single from the album on September 8, 2003, in the United Kingdom and other countries. The single proved to be the band's breakthrough hit on alternative rock radio in the United States - hitting number nine on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. It was also the band's first Top 10 hit in the UK, peaking at number eight, besting the number eleven peak of \"Plug In Baby\".\n\nThis song is notable for Chris Wolstenholme's groovy synth-bass riff that was inspired by Michael Jackson.\n\nThe video depicts a number of military officials seated at a round table performing actions simultaneously, moving to the beat of the song, as Muse play the song on the table, with the officials apparently oblivious to Muse's presence. Eventually, the officers begin to start dancing on the table, seeming to go insane. They eventually end up crawling. It is partially based on Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.\n\nTime Is Running Out was featured on the FLYING-DOG Soundtrack \nThe song has been featured in an episode of Entourage entitled \"The Boys Are Back in Town\" and in 2008, the song was featured on Torchwood Declassified, to represent the deaths of two main characters. \nIn 2006, the song was featured in the trailer for the film Running Scared and was also used in promotional spots of the Turner Classic Movies channel. \nIn 2005, The Feeling covered the song for Jo Whiley's Live Lounge on Radio One. They apparently did not know what the song was called or who it was by when they covered it. \nThe song has been featured in the book Blue Bloods by Melissa De La Cruz. \nThis song was used during a montage of Usain Bolt's 2008 Olympic performance on NBC. \nA string version by The Section Quartet[1] was played in an episode of Gossip Girl entitled \"New Haven Can Wait\" on October 14, 2008. \nThe song was played during the late night Hollyoaks special \"Back From The Dead\". \nThe song was used during an Australian Beach Cricket game on Channel 9 after returning from a commercial break, and in doing so has become part of the elite class of songs that have been used as bumper music. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Muse/_/Time+Is+Running+Out\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was also released as a single from that album on 1 December 2003 in the United Kingdom, peaking at number 17 in the UK Singles Chart (see 2003 in British music) and is also known for its famous bass line. It reached number 9 in the U.S. on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.\n\nThe artwork for the 7\" cover was chosen by competition, and the winner was Adam Falkus. The runner-up images are included in the DVD version of the single. The song was performed regularly during the tour in support of Absolution and remains a staple of the band's live show. The song also appears on the Absolution Tour DVD and on both the CD and DVD of HAARP.\n\nThe song's video, starring actor Justin Theroux, is based on the hotel-trashing scene from the movie Pink Floyd The Wall. It takes the form of a short narrative depicting a man (the protagonist) awakening inside of a hotel room and, through non-linear chronological elements, discovering that he both stalked and eventually met with a prostitute with whom he was obsessed (played by Alessandra Torresani ). This encounter, however, ends unpleasantly. The video has several interpretations and can be seen to have several ambiguous elements, including the fit of rage which induces the man to trash the hotel room, and several chronologically non-linear sequences describing elements of plot.\n\nAn alternate video was also created for the release of the single in the U.S. which features the band playing in front of a green screen; with white blood vessels, a woman's face, red, grey and black circles overlapping, and lightning.\n\nThe director's cut of the video features several women visiting the protagonist in his hotel room as well as the main woman from the original version and is available on the Microcuts fansite.\n\nThe television channel TNT used \"Hysteria\" in its commercials in late 2004, and it was also used in commercials for Guerlain's Insolence perfume. Aside from commercials, \"Hysteria\" was also featured in a season 2 episode of the HBO series Entourage, and was used alongside Blackout, another song from the Absolution album, in the movie Millions. The Washington Capitals used the song as a musical introduction to the second period of their home hockey games during the 2006-07 NHL Season[citation needed], and The Jim Rome Show uses this song as a \"bumper\" between show breaks. The British television program Brainiac: History Abuse used the song at the end of each show with the \"Explosive Of The Week\". It was also used as the main theme for Moto GP on the BBC up until the Dutch race at Assen in 2009, as well as the background song of the official race edit for the 2009 Australian Grand Prix on Formula1.com. Hysteria is frequently used as Windsor-Detroits 88.7, 89x's \"Morning X's\" starter song.\n\n\"Hysteria\" is also featured in the European version of the video game Rock Band and as downloadable content for the US version. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Muse/_/Hysteria\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song's title comes in part from the region of Mars named Cydonia, famous for the \"face on mars\". The radio edit version was first aired on KROQ radio on 6 June 2006, and released to other radio stations in the United States on 12 June 2006. The song was released as the third single from Black Holes & Revelations in the UK on 27 November 2006, debuting at #10 in the UK Singles Chart (see 2006 in British music). It also hit the #10 spot on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart in the United States, becoming their third top-ten hit on that chart. The song was described by BBC Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac on 27 October 2006 as \u2018six minutes and seven seconds of pure genius\u2019. In 2007, Eve of Summer recorded a remix. The song is also featured in the video game Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. It was also played on NBC during the 2008 summer olympics in Beijing right after Michael Phelps won his eighth gold medal and broke Mark Spitz's record of \"number of gold medals won in one Olympics\".\n\nThe first live performance of \"Knights of Cydonia\" took place at a BBC Radio 1 event, Radio 1's Big Weekend, held at Camperdown Park in Dundee on 2006-05-13. Also performed at this event were \"Supermassive Black Hole\" and \"Starlight\", the first two singles from Black Holes and Revelations. Live performances of \"Knights of Cydonia\" feature Bellamy's intro falsetto much more loudly and clearly than its studio counterpart. Recent live performances have featured Bellamy playing an extra guitar part during the solo at the end of song, as well as the coda of \"Space Dementia\" played as a finale.\n\nOn January 26, 2008, \"Knights of Cydonia\" was announced as the number-one song in Australia's 2007 Triple J Hottest 100. The song was also ranked #18 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time, 2009. It was also ranked #53 on Rhapsody's list of the Top 100 Tracks of the Decade.\n\nIn the intro is a citation of the five tone musical phrase from the film Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The song features vocals from both Bellamy's higher and lower ranges layered and both synthesised and live trumpet parts. The guitar sound in the song was inspired by the 1962 number one hit \"Telstar\" by The Tornados (George Bellamy, Matt Bellamy's father, was the band's rhythm guitarist). The song, taken in entirety, also bears a striking resemblance to George Bellamy's composition \"Ridin' the Wind\".\n\nThe song's meaning is to teach people to stand up for themselves and make their own destiny.\n\nBellamy has stated that on the album in general he tried to create a vision of what is occurring in the song. For example, the bassline has a galloping rhythm depicting someone riding a horse.\n\nThe KOC video was shot over five days: three days in Romania; one day in London; and one day in Red Rock, California; it was made available on July 11, 2006. It was filmed and edited as a thematic sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord: a spaghetti western film with post-apocalyptic influence, complete with beginning and end credits, livened with the occasional kung-fu cowboy or metal-clad maiden astride a unicorn. At the end of the video one can see Roman numerals MCMLXXXI which translates as 1981. However, in the introduction the numerals MCLMXXXI are seen,[6] which despite claims that it could equal 2081 (MMLXXXI) or 1881 (MDCCCLXXXI), is not a valid roman numeral.\n\nThe video was directed by Joseph Kahn, and stars British actor Russ Bain as the protagonist (The Man With No Name), Richard Brake as the antagonist (Sheriff Baron Klaus Rottingham), and Cassandra Bell as the love interest (Princess Shane Kuriyami). Throughout the video, the actors mouth out the lyrics, such as Russ Bain ramshackled in town square mouthing \u2018No one's going to take me alive\u2019, and Cassandra Bell at the gallows \u2018You and I must fight for our rights\u2019. In both instances, the mouthed words occur after the song lyrics and complete before the song moves on to the next line. The band appears in some scenes as holograms, and there are also some scenes featuring lead singer Bellamy. Also, when it shows the population of the town Cydonia it is shown as \"143\", a common symbol for \"I love you\", although it is unknown whether this is just a random number, or it was put there for a reason by the director or band.\n\nA very brief scene in which Bain has sex with his love interest was edited out of the video for presentation on television. The complete, uncensored version is available for viewing at the director's website, and on YouTube. In the scene where Bain has sex, the camera crew can be intentionally seen in the mirror left of the bed.\n\nA remix of the song was released as Future Funk Squad vs. Muse - \"Knights Of Cydonia\" (Breaks Mix).\n\nThere is also an unlicensed remix which was released on the Crisp Biscuit label, entitled \"Knights of Itchy Town\".\n\nA remix by Simian Mobile Disco titled Knights of Cydonia (Simian Mobile Disco Remix) is also included on Muse's Invincible EP, released in 2007.

The video won \"Best Special Effects\"..."}, "description": "\"Uprising\" is a song by British rock band Muse, featured on their fifth studio album The Resistance. Written by lead vocalist and guitarist Matthew Bellamy, the song was released as the lead single from the album on 7 September, 2009. The song remained at the #1 position on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart for 17 nonconsecutive weeks, and has become the band's most successful song in the United States. The song was mixed by Mark 'Spike' Stent. It was also the last UK single to top an American chart for the 2000s, according to the December 30, 2009 Nielsen BDS alternative chart, and also the first UK single to top an American chart for the 2010s.\n\nThe title \"Uprising\" was first revealed on 3 July 2009, when the album's track listing was released sporadically on the band's Twitter page; the song was unveiled as the opening track of the album, preceding the title track \"Resistance\". In a pre-release review, French media source JudeBox described the song as follows:\n\n\u201c Matt Bellamy's voice is deeper than usual. In terms of lyrics, this is the usual Muse: conspiracies, apocalypse, he announces a gathering, speaks of victory and that \"they will not control us.\" The sound, still very dense and heavy is accompanied by passages of synths. The overall structure is rather straightforward. [Translated from French] \u201d \n\nVarious sources have noted the synthesizer melody in the song's introduction sounds similar to the guitar riff in \"White Wedding\" by Billy Idol. The song's drums, clapping rhythm, synthesizer melody and patch, and general feel deeply resembles The Timelords/KLF's track \"Doctorin' the Tardis\", an homage to the long-running BBC series Doctor Who which itself uses the riff from Garry Glitter's \"Rock and Roll\". The guitar riff also is very similar to the chorus of Blondie's \"Call Me\".\n\nWhile \"United States of Eurasia\" was initially thought by the Muse fan community to be the first single due for release, Muse revealed, via their Twitter page, that it would in fact be \"Uprising\". It was revealed in July 2009 that the band would perform at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. They played at the theatre across the street from where the VMAs were held, and were introduced by Gerard Butler. On July 28, 2009 Zane Lowe played a 32 second sample on BBC Radio 1 ahead of its first play in full on August 3, 2009. After being released to radio in the United States, the single reached #1 on the Billboard Hot Alternative Songs chart on September 9, 2009, becoming Muse's 6th Top 10 single and first #1 on that chart, eventually spending 17 weeks at #1, becoming the second the longest running #1 song ever on the chart. It became their first Billboard Hot 100 single (and Top 40 single), peaking at #37, achieving this with virtually no pop radio airplay, instead relying on iTunes sales and alternative rock radio airplay. The song peaked at #9 on the UK Singles Chart and is the band's fourth top 10 single on that chart.\n\n\"Uprising\" won the Best Single award at the 2010 Music Producers Guild Awards in London.\n\n\"Uprising\" is often played on Network Ten's AFL broadcasts. \nIt is frequently played at Sydney Roosters home matches in 2010. \nIt is also featured in the trailer for the 2010 film Knight & Day and in promos for the March 30, 2010 return of V. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Muse/_/Uprising\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The beginning of the riff shows similarities to Bach's \"Toccata and Fugue\". Bellamy has also stated in a 2005 interview that it elaborates on the riff from DJ Shadow's track Organ Donor.\n\n The bassline has been noted as being very similar to that of Air's single Sexy Boy, which was released 3 years earlier. \n\n\"Plug In Baby\" is a featured song in the rhythm video game Guitar Hero 5. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Muse/_/Plug+In+Baby\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

I claim ownership of nothing shown in this video."}, "description": "\"Map of the Problematique\" is a song by English alternative rock band Muse, released on their 2006 fourth studio album, Black Holes and Revelations. It was released as the fifth single from the album on 18 June 2007 as a digital download only. The release date followed the two concerts Muse performed at Wembley Stadium on June 16 and June 17. The song has been closely compared to \"Enjoy the Silence\" by Depeche Mode due to its similar chord progression and arrangement. Muse frontman Matthew Bellamy has also cited Depeche Mode as inspiration for the song in interviews.\n\nThe title is a reference to a book called The Limits to Growth (1972) and the Club of Rome think-tank who would create a \"map of the problematique\" detailing the \"global problematique\" - a set of likely challenges the world might face in the near future. The Limits to Growth correctly predicted the economic crisis of 2008. In addition, the opening lyric, \"fear and panic in the air\" may be a reference to Mars, in that the red planet's two moons are named Phobos and Deimos, who were the Greek gods of Fear and Panic. Such a connection would fit in with numerous references to Mars in the album. It bears similarity with the music of Depeche Mode, especially Enjoy the Silence, and is a rare track in musical terms as it does not use the dominant chord ever in the riff: C minor, E flat major, A flat major, F minor.\n\n\"Map of the Problematique\" was used in trailers for Children of Men (2006). Also used in the commercial for Prison Break. A short clip of the song was also used during the BBC's coverage of Rugby Sevens World Series.\n\n\"Map of the Problematique\" originated from rehearsals before the recording of Black Holes and Revelations, and was one of the later songs the band started work on. It was originally played on synthesisers before being transferred to guitar, giving it a much darker sound, although initially the intention was to keep it as keyboard-orientated as possible. The rhythm section was recorded after the guitar tracks. This was different to anything the band had done before, according to Chris Wolstenholme, \"because the whole theme of the song was based more on the sound and creation of this sound\".\n\nIn very early live performances of the song, Matt Bellamy replaced the first three lines of the second verse with the following:\n\n   See a future on the run Running away And our judgement has begun\n \nFor performances of the song during the recent The Resistance Tour, Bellamy slightly adjusted the lyrics again. Instead of the second instance of\n\n   Since I met you\n \nBellamy now sings\n\n   Since I lost you\n \nThis is likely due to the fact that Matt and Gaia Polloni broke up during the tour.\n\nThe song reached number 18 in the UK singles chart in its first week of release, and was more successful than \"Invincible\", the previous single.\n\nThe song was used in numerous television adverts through 2006 and 2007, including British science fiction television series Primeval, TV spots for the 2006 film Children of Men, and during Live Earth. It has also been featured on Top Gear during Season 8, Episode 7 and Season 10, Episode 5 and, in the UK, samples were played on golfing events either before advertisements or when it moves on to another part of the event, and was used in numerous episodes of Masterchef. \"Map of the Problematique\" was also used as an entry song into the last episode of Doctor Who Confidential in the fourth series, entitled \"Journey's End\". RAI International television of Italy also uses it as an introduction to the news programme Italia Chiama Italia. The song was rated at #82 in Q Magazine's 100 lost tracks of 2006 list. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Muse/_/Map+of+the+Problematique\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In particular, Matt Bellamy now plays a slightly re-worked piano part during the intro, and substitutes the tremolo technique used in the solo for tapping. At the end of the song, Bellamy plays a riff from Rage Against the Machine's cover of \"Microphone Fiend\" or Deftones \"Headup\".\n\nMatthew Bellamy said of the song: \"It's about a semi-fear of the evolution of technology, and how in reality it's destroying all humanity. My fear is that we can't control it because it's moving faster than we are, so the songs setting myself in a location in the future where the body is no longer important and everyone's plugged into a network. The opening line is 'link it to the world', so it's connecting yourself on a worldwide scale and being born into another reality.\" The song was also remixed by Paul Oakenfold for the movie Swordfish, although it doesn't appear in the movie, it appears on the soundtrack.\n\nChris Wolstenholme said: \"New Born I think between the three of us is probably one of our favourite tracks off Origin of Symmetry. It is a good live track. I think it's one of the songs which showcases the experimental side of the band. It is not really a conventional pop song. I think a lot of the reason for choosing these songs is that we went for the heavier more direct kind of songs rather than going for anything too mellow\".[citation needed]\n\nThe song was featured in the film Haute Tension. The B-sides \"Shrinking Universe\" and \"Map of Your Head\" were featured on the Hullabaloo Soundtrack in the B-sides collection.\n\nThe song was \"performed\" on Live & Kicking, but due to the BBC producers not allowing the band to perform live, Matthew Bellamy waved his hands around instead of playing the keyboard. Chris Wolstenholme (bass) and Dom Howard (drums and percussion) swapped instruments for this mime performance. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Muse/_/New+Born\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song concerns itself with the \"butterfly effect,\" describing how individuals can change the world forever just as the turbulence generated by a butterfly's wings may create tiny changes in the atmosphere ultimately redirecting the path of a hurricane. The song is notable for its Rachmaninoff-style virtuoso piano solo that begins quietly with what may be likened to the flapping of thousands of tiny butterfly wings, and ends with the majestic cascading sounds of diminished 7ths flowing all the way up and down the piano keyboard.\n\nThere are several versions of \"Butterflies and Hurricanes\". For the original studio recording, introduction, verse and choruses were played on keyboard. The band later reworked the song for guitar during the Absolution tour, including an extended guitar solo before the piano interlude (and a bass filler to cover Matt Bellamy's transition from guitar to keyboard). The single version contains both guitar and keyboard, but loses the guitar solo, and the interlude is shorter, reducing the song from 5:01 to 4:48. The vinyl single includes a full-length version with guitars. Finally, the radio edit of the single goes further by omitting the entire piano interlude, bringing the song down to 4:10.\n\nThe promotional video comprises footage of \"Butterflies and Hurricanes\" being played at different venues along the Absolution tour with colourful effects added, and images of the Colosseum in Rome.\n\n\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\" was later covered with full orchestral accompaniment by pop pianist William Joseph on his 2004 album Within.\n\nThe song was dedicated to Dominic Howard's father, who died shortly after the band's performance at Glastonbury Festival. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Muse/_/Butterflies+and+Hurricanes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Muse move through three musical stages: starting off as a classical piece before moving into a techno mid-section and a heavy \"apocalyptic rock\" ending. Initially described \"a looping epic which morphs into a gothic fairytale\".  The chord structure moves in fourths upwards, by using the augmented fifth in between to move.\n\nInitially called \"Hex\", \"Take a Bow\" was originally going to be at the end of the album. Two months later, Chris indicated it could become the opening track. Put first on the album because it ends in the key of B which is the key of the second track. .\n\nWolstenholme: We wrote it at the end of the Absolution sessions, and it sounds similar [to Absolution tracks]. It has evolved a lot since then, but it\u2019s principle remains the same: a change of periodic agreements which are at the brink of exploding. Its structure is mathematical, the main idea being a formula with neither chorus nor verse. Dom\u2019s never played like that, with very jazzy rhythms, slow ones, followed by more chaotic bits integrated into the whole.\n\nTake a Bow was often played as a piano interlude between Citizen Erased and Space Dementia on the Absolution tour.

Bellamy believes that this is a very optimistic song.  He believes that Invincible is the \"heart\" of Black Holes and Revelations.\n\nThe song was initially played entirely on the guitar, without any keyboard part - Bellamy altered the introduction to its present keyboard form whilst rehearsing in the live room of Miraval Studio, and the lyrics came sometime after this.  The band recorded Invincible in \"a fit of rage\" due to not having been able to record Take a Bow.  It was originally thought of as a track that would not make the final album, however, this changed after the recording came together quickly in the studio.  The recording presented on the album is mostly a live one, with only a \"couple\" of overdubbed tracks.  When recording the marching drums, the band set up microphone by a window and marched towards it drumming, to build up the impression of an approaching army.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Muse/_/Invincible\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band consists of Matthew Bellamy on lead vocals, piano, keyboard and guitar, Chris Wolstenholme on backing vocals and bass guitar, and Dominic Howard on drums and percussion.  \n\nThey have been friends since their formation in early 1994 and changed band names a number of times (such as Gothic Plague, Fixed Penalty, and Rocket Baby Dolls) before adopting the name Muse. Since the release of their fourth album, Morgan Nicholls has also appeared with the band at live performances to provide keyboards, samples/synth, and backing vocals.\n\nTheir sound is a blend of alternative rock, classical music, electronica, metal, spanish guitars, and progressive rock. Usually they use the bass line as the driving force, often with the guitar providing only an extra layer to the song rather than carrying the melody, the bass has distortion and other effects applied to it to achieve a greater weight, allowing the guitar to digress from the main tune and play higher notes. Another peculiarity is Muse\u00b4s piano style in many of their songs; their music has been inspired by the works of Romantic pianist-composers such as Rachmaninoff, Tchaikovsky and Liszt, and has thus resulted in a fusion of Romantic style with modern rock.\n\nThe band are known for their energetic live performances and front man Matthew Bellamy's eccentric and avid interests in global conspiracy, extraterrestrial life, theology and the apocalypse (as much as in Space and theoretical physics). Their lyrical themes involve madcap conspiracy theory, revolutionary rabble-rousing, weird stuff about aliens (or Zetas, if you please), religions and other such classic Muse concerns. In general their music and lyrics gaze on helplessly at the subjugation of humanity by corrupt world leaders and encroaching environmental or galactic disasters (and certainly their fourth album 'Black Holes And Revelations' has its fair share of climate change/oil crisis/global inflagration paranoia). \n\nIn October 1999, Muse released their first full length LP; 'Showbiz'. The album received mixed reviews among critics, and music fans, labeling the band as 'Radiohead copycats'. This, however, did not stop the album from selling over 700,000 copies, with success coming from singles; Unintended and Muscle Museum. The album also earned Muse a nomination at the 2000 BRIT Awards, for Best New Act.\n\n2001, with John Leckie behind the desk again, saw the release of Origin of Symmetry along with Top 20 entries for Plug in Baby and New Born. The album went unreleased in the United States until 2005 because their record label at the time, Madonna's Maverick, allegedly thought the falsetto vocals would discourage radio play and wanted the band to re-record alternate vocals.  The band refused, and terminated its contract with Maverick.\n\nMuse followed up with a b-side/live CD/DVD named Hullabaloo Soundtrack, showcasing the band's concert from France in late 2001. To promote the album, Muse also released the Dead Star/In Your World EP, which charted high in the UK charts and proving Muse could also write \"radio-friendly\" rock tunes, as well as the 7 minute long epics on Origin of Symmetry. Muse polished off their impressive year by winning Best Live Band at the 2002 Kerrang! Awards.\n\nIn 2003, Muse asked Rich Costey to step behind the desk to help create Absolution. The album had very strong sales all over the world, and helped the band achieve their first UK number 1 album. Its release was preceded by a download-only single and online video for the song Stockholm Syndrome. Followed by the singles Time is Running Out and Hysteria, which charted well in the UK charts and helped Muse secure a headline spot at the 2004 Glastonbury Festival.\n\nGlastonbury saw Muse storm troop onto the high table of classic Glastonbury headline acts and prove themselves a formidable force in British rock.  Although many had their doubts at putting Muse on the bill with names such as Paul McCartney, Muse proved them all wrong and played what Bellamy described as \"the best gig of our lives.\" It was only with that triumph fresh in their throats, they claim, that they realised they'd 'made it'.  However tragedy struck just shortly after Muse came off stage when Dom Howard's father (a big Muse fan) collapsed after witnessing his son play and died on the site.\n\nLater that year, Muse toured the US, promoting Absolution, before returning home to play two sell-out gigs at London's Earls Court at the end of the year.\n\nIn 2006 and after a long and exhaustive tour, the band returned to the studio, and released Black Holes and Revelations.Interview with Dominic 2006\n\nWith the LP, the band secured their second UK album chart number one, whilst reaching the top spot in several other countries, as well as a Top 10 in the US billboard chart. The controversial single Supermassive Black Hole became Muse's highest UK entry in the charts, reaching number four, and also scored high entries in other countries. The album's second single, Starlight, reached number 13 in the UK charts in September 2006. The 3rd UK single was fan-favourite Knights of Cydonia, released on November 27th, and it reached number 10 in the UK charts. The 4th single from Black Holes & Revelations was Invincible, and was released April 15th 2007. It entered the UK singles chart at 21st place, and was the first single from the new album not to enter in the Top 20. On November 2, 2006, the band won an award for Best Alternative Act at the annual MTV EMA in Copenhagen. Muse were also named 'Best Live Act' at the Brit Awards in 2006 and have retained the title in 2007.\n\nTwo of the album's singles reached the highest US Modern Rock chart positions in the band's career during 2007: Starlight reached #2 in February 2007, and the all-falsetto Supermassive Black Hole reached #6 in October.  2007 also saw the band play to sellouts at Madison Square Garden and the Forum in Los Angeles, as well as headlining Austin City Limits Festival and Lollapalooza.\n\nEven when the band says they do not see themselves as a massive stadium band, their headline concert on June 16th 2007, at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium, sold out in 45 minutes six months before the gig and the band had to add a second show on June 17, where they proved to be more than worthy of stadium gigs.  The Wembley gigs became two of the biggest hyped concerts of 2007.  Already the gigs have been compared by music journalists to Live Aid and Queen gigs, also performed on the \"Hallowed Ground.\"  The band's next release, HAARP: Live from Wembley, is expected to be made up of footage from the June 17th show.\n\nIn July 2007, Bellamy confirmed that he had begun to work on a new studio album and new songs, some more in line with electronic or \"dance\" music and others more with classical or symphonic music. \n\nIn January 2008 the song \"Knights of Cydonia\" was voted number 1 on the Triple J Hottest 100, Australia's biggest annual alternative music countdown.\n\nIn 2009, the band released The Resistance, which contained the successful single \"Uprising\", the band's first Top 40 pop hit in the United States (achieving this with very little radio airplay) and their first #1 on the Billboard Modern Rock Chart. Followup singles \"Resistance\" and \"Undisclosed Desires\" also proved successful. \n\nThe band's sixth album, The 2nd Law, was released on 1 October 2012. The album's first single, \"Survival\", is the official song of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. The second single, \"Madness\" was released on 20 August 2012. The third single, \"Follow Me\" was released on 7 December 2012, with an accompanying lyrics video released on the band's YouTube channel on 1 November 2012. The album has recieved generally positive reviews, with Allmusic noting \"their excursions into dubstep and dance music on tracks like \"Madness\" and \"Follow Me\" feel more like remixes than original songs.\"\n\nTheir latest album Drones was released on June 5 2015, and the band is set to release a new single on May 18 2017. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Muse\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was composed and produced by Brian Wilson, with lyrics by Tony Asher, Brian Wilson and Mike Love. The lead vocal was sung by Brian Wilson with Mike Love singing lead vocals on the bridge.\n\nThe layering of harmonies upon harmonies, and lyrics on top of harmonies make this one of the quintessential Beach Boys songs. In the Endless Harmony documentary, Brian Wilson described the song as \"what children everywhere go through\u2026 wouldn't it be nice if we were older, or could run away and get married\".\n\nWilson was quoted as saying:\n\n    Listen for the rockin' accordions and the ethereal guitars in the introduction. Tony and I had visualized a scene. We had a feeling in our hearts, like a vibration. We put it into music, and it found its way onto tape. We really felt good about that record.\n\nIn a 1996 interview, Wilson stated, \"'Wouldn't It Be Nice' was not a real long song, but it's a very 'up' song.

It is the eighth track on the group's eleventh studio album Pet Sounds (1966), and one of their most widely recognized songs. \"God Only Knows\" was composed and produced by Brian Wilson, with lyrics by Tony Asher, and the lead vocal was sung by Carl Wilson.\n\nThe song broke new ground in many ways. It was one of the first commercial pop songs to use the word 'God' in its title. The song was also far more technically sophisticated than anything the Beach Boys, or arguably any pop group, had ever attempted before - particularly the complicated melodic structure and vocal harmonies. As producer, Brian Wilson also used many unorthodox instruments for the genre, including the harpsichord and French horns that are heard in the song's famous introduction.\n\nMojo magazine ranked the song as the 13th greatest song of all time. Pitchfork Media named it the best song of the 1960s. The song is 25th on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/_/God+Only+Knows\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song features Love on lead vocal for the verse, and Wilson for the chorus. It is noteworthy for its back to front structure - it starts with a chorus and has two short verses. It was a single which was released in 1964 through Capitol Records; the B-side of the single was \"Don\u2019t Worry Baby\", which itself charted at number 24 in the United States. \"I Get Around\" was The Beach Boys' first number-one hit song in the United States. The single also charted at number seven in the United Kingdom, which was the band's first top ten single there. The song's first album release was on All Summer Long in 1964.\n\nIn November 1969, the Wilson's father Murry Wilson, sold the copyrights to the band's songs to Irving Almo for approximately $700,000.[1] Many years later in April 1992, just after Brian Wilson had won a lawsuit which recovered many of the copyrights to his songs, Mike Love filed a lawsuit against Brian Wilson claiming that he had not been given credit, and therefore hadn't received royalties, on over thirty of the band's songs, many of them hit singles.[2] One of these songs was \"I Get Around\". The original credit only credited Wilson, but Love insisted that he had a hand in writing the lyrics. In an interview with Goldmine, published September 18, 1992, Love insisted that he and not Wilson \"came up with 'round round get around'\". Mike Love won the lawsuit and the song-writing credit was amended, therefore ensuring future royalties on all of the songs that he had claimed he had a hand in writing.\n\n    * Knights in 1964\n    * The Catalinas in 1964\n    * The Surfriders in 1967\n    * Langley Schools Music Project in 1977\n    * Bakersfield Boogie Boys in 1980\n    * Papa Doo Run Run on their 1985 album California Project\n    * Papa-O in 1994\n    * Trygve Thue in 1994\n    * Brian Wilson on his 2001 live album Live at the Roxy Theatre.\n    * John B. & The Surfin\u00b4 Safaris in 2002\n    * Pennywise\n    * Red Hot Chili Peppers, performed in concert in 2004\n    * Evan and Jaron also sang a cover version at An All Star Tribute to Brian Wilson in 2001, which was later released on DVD.\n\nThe first film in which the song appeared was the 1984 film Surf II.

The recording reached a peak position of #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 record chart.\n \nThe most famous cover version is by the American rock band The Beach Boys. The song was released as a single on December 20, 1965, with the B-side \"Girl Don't Tell Me\". The song peaked at #2 in the US Billboard Hot 100 (#1 in Cash Box and Record World) and at #3 in the UK It also topped the charts in Germany, Switzerland and Norway. It was The Beach Boys' biggest hit in Italy, reaching #4. The song was also released on the 1965 album \"Beach Boys' Party!\" Brian Wilson and Dean Torrence, who had previously recorded the song as one half of Jan and Dean, are featured on lead vocals. Dean is not credited on the album jacket but \"Thanks, Dean\" is said by Carl at the end of the track.\n \nA version recorded by the Beach Boys without the \"Beach Boys' Party!\" effects can be found on the \"Hawthorne, CA\" album. The Beach Boys made a false start on the Party! album by singing \"Baa Baa Black Sheep\" instead of \"Baa Baa Baa Baa Barbara Ann\". The Beach Boys sang this song as an encore on their \"Live In London\" album. Brian Wilson has a rendition on his live \"Roxy\" CD, and in 2001, performed it himself, with the ensemble, on An All-Star Tribute to Brian Wilson.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/_/Barbara+Ann\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Berry has sole credit for composing the song. \"Surfin' USA\" was recorded by The Beach Boys released as a single on March 4, 1963 and it also appeared on the 1963 album of the same name. The B-side of the single is \"Shut Down\". The song features Mike Love on lead vocals. The songwriting credit for the song was eventually given entirely to Chuck Berry, as \"Surfin' USA\" is similar to Berry's song \"Sweet Little Sixteen\" in many respects, including melody, rhythm, and lyrics.\nBrian Wilson claims the song was merely influenced by Berry, as well as Chubby Checker and Jimmy Bowles, the little brother of Wilson's girlfriend Judy. Bowles came up with the list of surf spots which were included in the song\n\nIt was revived in 1977 by teen idol Leif Garrett, who also had a top 20 hit with it in the USA.\n\nThe song was famously featured in the hit 1985 Michael J.

It is the second track on the album. The song was composed and produced by Brian Wilson with the lyrics by Tony Asher. This was the first song on Pet Sounds to which Asher wrote lyrics. The lead vocal was sung by Brian Wilson. The song was originally titled \"In My Childhood\" and a bicycle horn and bell from \"In My Childhood\" can be heard at the end of the song because they could not be edited out of the final track. This song \"compositionally embodies the unique manner in which Brian writes his music. In a sense, Brian created a new way of using the scale. His progressions are always going up, then pausing before they go up again, like they're going towards God.\" In the mono version of the song, the lead is shared by Brian and Carl Wilson. The new stereo version, due to inability to locate the source material for Carl's vocal overdub, has only a single-tracked lead by Brian.\n\nTo achieve the unique sound in the introduction, Tony Asher explains that \"one of us had to get inside the piano to pluck the strings, while the other guy had to be at the keyboard pushing the notes so that they would ring.\" Brian in 1966 explained that this song is \"A little 'Boys Choir'-type song with me doing the soprano. Very, very spiritual.\"\n\nThis song has been covered by M. Ward and also appears on the Beach Boys' In Concert album. Brian recorded this song for his 2002 album Pet Sounds Live.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/_/You+Still+Believe+in+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band's version, a tender ballad with falsetto lead vocal by Brian, was first released on their 1964 album Shut Down Volume 2. It was also released as the B-side of The Beach Boys' first U.S. number-one hit single, \"I Get Around\", managing to reach number 24 on the U.S. Hot 100 in its own right. The single was released in the United States in May 1964 through Capitol Records. It was released a month later, in June 1964, in the United Kingdom. Brian Wilson cited the song as his attempt to capture the essence of his all-time favourite record, \"Be My Baby\" by the Ronettes, who would later cover his song. At one time, Wilson listened to his 45 record of the song he \"could never do\" up to 100 times a day. John Lennon's 1980 hit, \"(Just Like) Starting Over\", is considered by some to somewhat borrow from the chorus melody of \"Don't Worry Baby\", while Garbage's 1998 hit, \"Push It\", contains an interpolation of its chorus. The song is prominently featured in the 2006 thriller, D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu. The song \"Don't Worry Baby\" is part of the The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll list., and ranked as the 176th greatest song of all time in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

Listen for the twelve-string guitar right after the lyric \"I'm a little bit scared 'cause I haven't been home in a long time.\"\n\nUnlike all of the other songs on Pet Sounds, this track actually featured the Beach Boys playing the instruments; Brian had been using session musicians since The Beach Boys Today!. Brian Wilson plays organ, Carl Wilson plays guitar, and Dennis Wilson plays drums. Alan Jardine has also been credited as playing tambourine, while Mike Love sings the lead vocal with the whole band singing background vocals. The whole band is featured on this one track as the liner notes imply:\n\nThe AFM contract for this date lists Brian, Carl, Dennis, Alan and Bruce as having played on this track. However, on the surviving session tape, only Brian, Carl and Dennis are clearly audible on the basic track, which includes just drums, organ, one guitar, and tamborine. As Brian was on the studio floor. Bruce was in the control booth, helping Chuck Britz direct the session. The tamborine apparently was played by Alan Jardine or an uncredited Terry Melcher; Brian has named the latter on at least one occasion.\n\nAlthough it is unclear who is playing the tambourine, highlights from the session imply that it could be Alan Jardine who is playing the tambourine with them. An overdub session came later.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/_/That%27s+Not+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Pet Sounds Sessions compilation included an alternate take featuring Mike on lead vocals.

It was released as a single and it then appeared on the 1963 album of the same name, Surfer Girl. The B-side of the single was Little Deuce Coupe. The single was the first Beach Boys record to have Brian Wilson officially credited as the producer.\n\nWritten solely by Brian Wilson, the song is one of his very first compositions. Although the song is sometimes referred to as a tribute to his then girlfriend Judy Bowles, this is untrue as the song wasn't written with anyone particular in mind. The meter of the song is identical to \"When You Wish upon a Star\".\n\nBrian explained the genesis of the song: \"Back in 1961, I'd never written a song in my life. I was nineteen years old. And I put myself to the test in my car one day. I was actually driving to a hot dog stand, and I actually created a melody in my head without being able to hear it on a piano. I sang it to myself; I didn't even sing it out loud in the car. When I got home that day, I finished the song, wrote the bridge, put the harmonies together and called it 'Surfer Girl'.\"\n\nThe band first recorded the song at World Pacific Studios on February 8, 1962 which was one of the band's first ever recording sessions. However, the recordings from that session, engineered by Hite Morgan, would ultimately remain unreleased until later archival releases.\n\nThe instrumental track as well as the vocals for the officially released version were recorded at Western Recorders on June 12, 1963. The session was produced by Brian; the first song, along with \"Little Deuce Coupe\", to be credited as a Brian production. The musicians on the track are David Marks and Carl Wilson on guitar; Brian Wilson on bass guitar and Dennis Wilson on drums. The finished instrumental track can be heard on the 1968 release Stack-O-Tracks. The song is sung by the group - Mike Love, Carl & Dennis Wilson - with a prominent vocal by Brian. Also recorded during that session was \"Little Deuce Coupe\".\n\n    * The Sentinals on their 1964 album Surfer Girl\n    * Hollyridge Strings covered the song instrumentally on their 1966 album The Beach Boys Song Book, Volume 2\n    * The Fantastic Baggys on their 1966 album Ride The Wild Surf\n    * Little Joe Shaver & Devil Dog on their 1976 album Sing the Hits of the Beach Boys\n    * Papa Doo Run Run on their 1985 album California Project\n    * Phranc on her 1991 album Positively Phranc\n    * Cathedral City Project in 1994\n    * Pere Ubu on the 1995 album Ray Gun Suitcase\n    * Don Grusin on the 1997 tribute album Wouldn't It Be Nice: A Jazz Portrait Of Brian Wilson\n    * Philip Aaberg & Scott Mathews on the 1997 various artists compilation Summer Solstice: A Windham Hill Collection\n    * Fred Simon on his 1998 album Fred Simon's Interpretation of The Beach Boys\n    * John B. & The Surfin\u00b4 Safaris on their 2002 album A Tribute to the Beach Boys\n    * Scott Cain on his 2004 album Roller Coaster\n\nPaul Simon sang a cover version of the song at An All-Star Tribute to Brian Wilson in 2001, which was later released on DVD.\n\nOC Times caused consternation at the 2007 International convention of the Barbershop Harmony Society by singing a barbershop arrangement of this song.\n\nThe song featured the film Surf's Up. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/_/Surfer+Girl\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The lead vocal was sung by Mike Love and Al Jardine with Brian Wilson singing lead on the choruses. The song features interesting use of a bass harmonica and a banjo.\n\nThe song was originally named \"Hang On to Your Ego,\" but when the lyric of the chorus was changed after concerns that the LSD-related connotations of the phrase \"Hang On to Your Ego\" would be too controversial, the title of the song was also renamed.

An early full working title was \"Let's Go Away For Awhile (And Then We'll Have World Peace)\" - the parenthetical being a reference to Del Close and John Brent's comedy album How to Speak Hip. \"This is a great Burt Bacharach type of thing,\" Brian said in 1996.\n\nBrian stated in 1967 that it was \"the most satisfying piece of music I've ever made. I applied a certain set of dynamics through the arrangement and the mixing and got a full musical extension of what I'd planned during the earliest stages of the theme. I think the chord changes are very special. I used a lot of musicians on the track; twelve violins, piano, four saxes, oboe, vibes, a guitar with a coke bottle on the strings for a semi-steel guitar effect. Also, I used two basses and percussion. The total effect is Let's Go Away For Awhile, which is something everyone in the world must have said at some time or another. Nice thought; most of us don't go away, but it's still a nice thought.\"\n\nIt was included on the Neil Young soundtrack album Journey Through the Past as the closing track.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/_/Let%27s+Go+Away+for+Awhile\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was originally going to be released on their classic 1966 album Pet Sounds. Mike Love however objected to the title of the song and some of the lyrics and insisted that it be changed. \"I was aware that Brian was beginning to experiment with LSD and other psychedelics,\" explained Love. \"The prevailing drug jargon at the time had it that doses of LSD would shatter your ego, as if that were a positive thing... I wasn't interested in taking acid or getting rid of my ego.\" Jardine recalled that the decision to change the lyrics was ultimately Wilson's. \"Brian was very concerned. He wanted to know what we thought about it. To be honest, I don't think we even knew what an ego was... Finally Brian decided, 'Forget it. I'm changing the lyrics. There's too much controversy.'\" Terry Sachen, who co-wrote the revised lyrics to this song, was the Beach Boys' road manager in 1966.\n\nThe song was then renamed to \"I Know There's an Answer\" and it was released on Pet Sounds as the ninth track on the album. The lead vocal was sung by Mike Love and Alan Jardine with Brian Wilson singing lead on the choruses. The song was later covered by Frank Black on his eponymous 1993 album. The cover is a departure from the original in style as it is heavily influenced by 80s synthesizer work while staying true to the original. Black even tried singing like Brian on the song. Sonic Youth also did a cover of I Know There's an Answer in 1990. The song appears as a bonus track on the reissue of Goo. \"Hang On to Your Ego\" appears on the reissue of Pet Sounds as a bonus track.\n\nDetails\n\n    * Written by: Brian Wilson/Tony Asher\n    * Time: 3 min 08 sec\n    * Produced by: Brian Wilson\n    * Instrumental track: recorded February 9, 1966 at Western Recorders, Hollywood, California.

Sure, great bands ascend beyond basements and handmade demos all the time, but the best acts start with little consideration for the outside world. The groups are their own insular worlds, where the reward comes from the process, not accolades and riches. And the bands that thrive on their own artistic satisfaction usually wind up being the bands that are able to grow beyond the donation jar into sustainable successful musical careers. Their charisma is contagious, their songs exist outside of fads, and their spirits can weather the inevitable ups and downs of life as touring musicians. Such is the case with the Atlanta trio The Coathangers.When The Coathangers started up in 2006, their aspirations were humble. \u201cI think all bands in their early twenties start for fun,\u201d says guitarist/vocalist Julia Kugel when talking about their early years of cheeky no-wave and irreverent garage rock. But Julia and her bandmates Meredith Franco (bass/vocals) and Stephanie Luke (drums/vocals) were serious about their craft, and that combination of modest outside expectations and absolute dedication to their music made for exhilarating live shows and contagious records. Ten years later, The Coathangers are still going strong, and while their palette has expanded over the years to touch upon hip-shakin\u2019 classic rock, soulful country ballads, and golden oldies pop, their primary attack strategy still relies heavily on the jagged hooks and boisterous choruses of their formative years. Their fifth album Nosebleed Weekend retains all the devil-may-care magnetism and serrated instrumentation of their debut, but it flourishes with a decade\u2019s worth of songwriting discipline and chemistry.Nosebleed Weekend kicks off with \u201cPerfume\u201d, a song that marries sultry pop vocals with toothy guitar riffs in a manner that would make Ann and Nancy Wilson proud. It\u2019s hard to imagine The Coathangers writing a song this accessible in their early years, but in 2016 it fits perfectly into their canon. From there the band launches into \u201cDumb Baby\u201d, which harkens back to the gritty neo-garage rock of Murder City Devils. Longtime fans who still clamor for their brash post-punk angle will be immediately satiated by \u201cSqueeki Tiki\u201d. And after hearing the noisy loud-quiet-loud bombast of \u201cExcuse Me?\u201d it\u2019s no wonder that Kim Gordon has become an outspoken fan of the band. It\u2019s an eclectic album inspired by life on the road, lost loved ones, and Kugel\u2019s recent move to Southern California. \u201cWe always say that each record is a snapshot of our life at the time,\u201d Kugel says. \u201cAs far as style\u2026 it\u2019s just what came out of us at that point.\u201d So whether it\u2019s the foreboding garage rock of the title track, the post-punk groove of \u201cBurn Me\u201d, the stripped-down pop of \u201cI Don\u2019t Think So\u201d, or the dynamic grunge of \u201cDown Down\u201d, The Coathangers command their songs with passion and authority.The biggest departure for Nosebleed Weekend was the recording process. While all their previous albums were recorded in Atlanta at The Living Room with Ed Rawls, their latest album found the band out in California\u2019s North Hollywood at Valentine Recording Studios with Nic Jodoin. \u201cThe Beach Boys and Bing Crosby both recorded there!\u201d Kugel says excitedly. \u201cIt was an amazing experience, not to mention a ghostly one too. The studio had been custom built by Jimmy Valentine and he was very protective of his passion. It sounds weird, but his spirit was there, checking in on us and fucking with us a bit.\u201d Nosebleed Weekend was the first session at Valentine Recording Studios since Jimmy\u2019s professional interests were diverted elsewhere in 1979. The studio doors were shut, capturing a time capsule of the LA music industry back in the \u201870s. Thinking back to the early years of The Coathangers, it\u2019s hard to imagine the scrappy Southern ladies ever recording in a historic studio in the San Fernando Valley, but it\u2019s a classic demonstration of what can happen when humble young punks stick to their guns.

Sure, great bands ascend beyond basements and handmade demos all the time, but the best acts start with little consideration for the outside world. The groups are their own insular worlds, where the reward comes from the process, not accolades and riches. And the bands that thrive on their own artistic satisfaction usually wind up being the bands that are able to grow beyond the donation jar into sustainable successful musical careers. Their charisma is contagious, their songs exist outside of fads, and their spirits can weather the inevitable ups and downs of life as touring musicians. Such is the case with the Atlanta trio The Coathangers.<br> When The Coathangers started up in 2006, their aspirations were humble. \u201cI think all bands in their early twenties start for fun,\u201d says guitarist/vocalist Julia Kugel when talking about their early years of cheeky no-wave and irreverent garage rock.

Rooted in doo-wop and rock and roll, their early string of vocal surf hits defined the '60s California Sound. For a period afterward, they notably delved into progressive pop styles. often combining elements from classical and jazz in innovative ways. \n\nFormed in Hawthorne, California in 1961, the original group comprised singer-musician-composer and bandleader Brian Wilson, his brothers Carl Wilson and Dennis Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. Wilson neighbor David Marks appeared on their first four albums and was a member from 1962 to 1963 as a temporary replacement for Jardine, who had left the group to pursue a career in dentistry.\n\nOn their first few studio albums, the group primarily played surf music, but this changed after 1964 as their songs became more sophisticated and autobiographical. The 1965 album Today! particularly represented this shift in sound. Bruce Johnston joined the group that same year. Session drummer Hal Blaine is quoted: \"We all studied in conservatories; we were trained musicians. We thought it was a fluke at first, but then we realized Brian was writing these incredible songs. This was not just a young kid writing about high school and surfing.\"\n\nFollowing their most esteemed work, Pet Sounds (1966), the band became symbols of psychedelic counterculture. The highly anticipated follow-up, Smile, was left unfinished, and Brian soon relinquished his creative hold on the group. A trilogy of lo-fi releases followed: Smiley Smile (1967), Wild Honey (1967), and Friends (1968). Brian would not be credited as a primary composer for any Beach Boys album until 1977's Love You, an album on the fringe of synth-pop, new wave, and punk.\n\nIn Brian's absence, the Beach Boys still managed to release music that was regarded favorably by fans and critics despite poor sales: Sunflower (1970) and  Surf's Up (1971). South African musicians Blondie Chaplin  and Ricky Fataar played and sang with the band on the next two albums: Carl & the Passions - So Tough (1972), and Holland (1973).\n\nMany changes in both musical style and personnel have occurred in their sometimes-stormy career: Brian Wilson's mental illness and drug addiction; the deaths of Dennis Wilson in 1983 and Carl Wilson in 1998; and continuing legal battles among surviving members of the group. With the release of 1974's Endless Summer they became a more popular touring act, playing their greatest hits. They have recorded 36 Billboard Top 40 hits (including four number-one singles), have had over 100 million sales, and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.\n\nOfficial site: http://www.thebeachboys.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

After the single was released, the song ended up being a huge hit, spending five weeks at the top of the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was written by frontman Billie Joe Armstrong about his struggle with anxiety; before he was diagnosed with a panic disorder, he thought he was going crazy. The music video, featuring the band members in a mental institution, received heavy airplay on MTV. This song and its music video helped propel Dookie to become a major success among most mainstream rock listeners. Dookie went on to become a multi-platinum album featuring this song as well as hit singles \"Longview\", \"When I Come Around\", \"Welcome to Paradise\" and \"She\".\n\nIn 1995, Green Day was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group for \"Basket Case\".\n\nIn 2006, on Mike Davies and Zane Lowe's Lock Up Special on BBC Radio 1, the listeners voted \"Basket Case\" the Greatest Punk Song of All Time.\n\nThe song can also be found on their 2001 greatest hits compilation International Superhits!. The music video can be found on their International Supervideos! DVD.

It was released in June 2005 as the fourth single from their seventh album, American Idiot.\n\nThe song deals with the death of lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong's father, who died when Armstrong was a child.\n\nThe single peaked at number six in the United States, becoming Green Day's second Top 10 single. It also peaked at #8 in Canada and the UK, while making #13 in Australia. \"Wake Me Up When September Ends\" had sold 1,652,000 copies as of May 2010, and was the second highest selling single in the U.S. from American Idiot, behind only the multi-platinum \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\". The song ended the streak of Green Day's three consecutive #1 hits on the Modern Rock Tracks chart (\"American Idiot\", \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" and \"Holiday\"), but it hit #2 on the chart, kept from #1 by Gorillaz \"Feel Good Inc.\". The song also hit #2 on the Adult Top 40 and #4 on the Mainstream Top 40. This was the band's most successful song to the adult contemporary market, hitting #13 on its own chart and their only song to chart other than \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\". The song is certified Silver in the United Kingdom for sales of 200,000\n\n\nMusic video\n\nLike the majority of the videos from the album American Idiot, it was directed by Samuel Bayer. The video features Green Day's support guitarist, Jason White. This is the second time Jason White has appeared in a Green Day video, first appearing in \"When I Come Around\", ten years earlier but not as a band member.\n\nThe video focuses on a very loving couple (played by Jamie Bell and Evan Rachel Wood). The boyfriend promises never to leave his girlfriend but they later argue when the boyfriend enlists in the United States Marine Corps. The boyfriend interprets his actions as a way to show her that he loves her so much that he would put his life on the line to keep her safe; the girlfriend, however, is heartbroken, as he broke his vow to never leave her, and terrified at the thought that he might die in battle. The video then shows the boyfriend in battle in Iraq being ambushed by insurgents. This scene is intercut with scenes of the girlfriend tearfully mourning in a quiet field. The video ends on this juxtaposition, emphasizing the pain and heartache of losing loved ones due to the war.\n\nThis video adds to the American Idiot anti-war sentiment of the Iraq War. The song eventually became a tribute song to the victims of Hurricane Katrina, and sound bites were added from various news coverages to the song. A live version of the song, recorded on September 3, 2005, at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts was released soon after and dedicated to the hurricane's victims. The song was performed live with U2 guitarist The Edge in the pregame show of the Monday Night Football game between the New Orleans Saints and the Atlanta Falcons; it was the first game played in the Superdome in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.\n\n\nReleased\tJune 13, 2005\nFormat\tDigital download, CD single, vinyl, Video single\nRecorded\tSeptember 2003\nGenre\tAlternative rock\nLength\t4:45\nLabel\t Reprise/Warner Bros.\nWriter(s)\tBillie Joe Armstrong / Green Day\nProducer(s)\tRob Cavallo, Green Day\nCertification\tPlatinum (RIAA) <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Green+Day/_/Wake+Me+Up+When+September+Ends\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

However, the appearance of \"American Idiot\" on the US singles charts occurred just prior to Billboard Magazine's inclusion of internet download purchases into their Billboard Hot 100 chart data, which would have made a significant difference in the song's peak had it benefited from the new chart tabulation system. This most recent form of sales assessment has resulted in the far greater successes of \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", \"Holiday\" and \"Wake Me Up When September Ends\".\n\n\"American Idiot\" became Green Day's first Top 5 single in the United Kingdom, reaching #3, and peaked at #7 in Australia. It debuted at #1 in Canada, holding onto the zenith position for five weeks.\n\nIn Australia, the song was ranked #22 on Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2004.\n\nGreen Day performed this at the 2005 Grammy Awards. The album won for Best Rock Album.\n\nThe song was featured in the trailer for the 2005 film Wedding Crashers. The song features on the soundtrack of the American football video game Madden NFL 2005. It was featured as the closing theme song for the first season of the \"Andy Milonakis\" show. \"Weird Al\" Yankovic parodied the song on his album Straight Outta Lynwood as \"Canadian Idiot\" - a satirical commentary on American nationalism and the stereotypical American view of Canadians. In The Simpsons Movie,the song was played by an organist at the band's funeral. Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine covered this song into a lounge style on their 2005 album Aperitif for Destruction, and Avril Lavigne did as well in 2006. The guitar riffs of the song were sampled for the theme for Johnny Test and multiple episodes of the show.\n\nSong information\n\nThe song was written by all three members of Green Day, and was co-produced by Green Day and Rob Cavallo. It is in the key of A-flat major, and is widely known for the guitar riff that plays through the whole song, excluding the chorus.\n\nThe whole song is similar to the intro riff from Dillinger Four's \"Doublewhiskeycokenoice\", written in 1997. Dillinger Four opened for Green Day on Green Day's Japan tour, and released a split 7\" with Billie Joe Armstrong's side project, Pinhead Gunpowder\n\n\"American Idiot\" criticizes the post 9/11 U.S., referring to such issues as paranoia, propaganda and media. \"American Idiot\" has also been certified as an RIAA Gold (500,000 downloads) along with \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", American Idiot's second single.\n\nThe song helped pave the road for the future American Idiot singles, \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" (which, in a great turnaround, would reach #2 in the U.S.), \"Holiday\" (a Top 30 hit worldwide), \"Wake Me Up When September Ends\" (which would reach #6 in the U.S. and the Top 20 worldwide), and \"Jesus of Suburbia\". It was their first #1 on the Modern Rock Tracks from the American Idiot album and their sixth overall. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Green+Day/_/American+Idiot\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Though the song is a prelude to \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", \"Holiday\" was released as a single later on, in the spring of 2005. The song achieved considerable popularity across the world and performed moderately well on the charts. In the U.S., it reached number nineteen on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks and Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks charts. It debuted at number eleven in the UK and at number twenty-one in Canada.\n\n\"Holiday\" features a spoken word segment during the bridge that is unique to Green Day songs. While it caused controversy, this speech is generally regarded as anti-fascist, with Green Day accusing George W. Bush of being a fascist.\n\nDuring live performances, lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong liked to introduce this song with a political agenda, or alternatively, a disclaimer. For example, on Green Day's CD/DVD Bullet in a Bible (2005), Armstrong announces, \"This next song's a big 'fuck you' to all the politicians. This song's called Holiday! This song is not anti-American; it's anti-war!\" Which some consider to be similar to the way in which Bono of U2 would introduce \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\"; \"This is not a rebel song...\".\n\n\"Holiday\" was played in the movie Accepted and parts of the song were played in the movie Surf's Up. The song is also featured in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Green+Day/_/Holiday\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Although written by lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong just after the release of their 1994 hit album Dookie, the song was not released until their third major-label album Nimrod in 1997 although an alternate version did appear as a B-side to the 1995 German import single for \"Brain Stew/Jaded\".\n\n\nWriting and composition\n\nIn comparison to previous Green Day material, \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" features more mellow, contemplative lyrics with acoustic music. Band member Mike Dirnt went on to state that the release of this song was probably the \"most punk\" thing they could have done. The song is more commonly promoted on the radio as \"Time of Your Life\", and it became a Billboard Rock chart-topper and an international hit, and was the only song from Nimrod that was a crossover success when released in single form.\n\nThe song began life as an entirely different version as a B-side to the Insomniac album. This alternate version featured strummed chords instead of the usual sound and lacked the orchestra strings found on the more well known version. This early version can be found on the \"Brain Stew\" single.\n\nBillie Joe Armstrong in an interview in Guitar Legends magazine, May 2005:\n        \"At the time I wrote Good Riddance, I was breaking up with a girl that was moving to Ecuador, and I was trying to be as understanding about it as I could. I wrote the song as kind of a bon voyage. I was trying not to be bitter, but I think it came out a little bit bitter anyway... I thought that calling the song \"Time of Your Life\" was just a little too level-headed for me, so I had to come up with something different\"\n\nOn the album version, at the beginning, Billie Joe Armstrong makes a mistake (the 3rd and 4th strings of the open G/D chord are played instead of the 2nd and 3rd), tries again, repeats the mistake, and in anger swears in a barely audible voice. This mistake was recorded on purpose and included in the song to provide comic relief, as it is considered one of their more serious songs.\n\nAppeal\n\nThe song reached a massive audience in one night, when it was used during the special two part \"Clip Show\" of the extremely popular show Seinfeld in 1998. The song played during a montage of clips from the show.\n\nBillie Joe plays an electric acoustic version of the song as their traditional show-closer for live Green Day concerts, including their live performance on Bullet in a Bible.\n\nThe song features on their greatest hits compilation International Superhits!.\n\nThe song appeared on the Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time, 2009 at 75, as voted by the Australian public.\n\n\nMusic video\n\nThe music video was directed by Mark Kohr, and features Billie Joe Armstrong playing an acoustic guitar in a bedroom interjected with scenes depicting various people undergoing every-day-things. Band members Mike Dirnt and Tr\u00e9 Cool make cameo appearances in the video as a person getting gas (Dirnt), and an injured bike rider (Cool). Also when the video came out, both names of the songs were swapped and were known as \"Time of Your Life (Good Riddance)\", this name was also used on the single cover.\n\nIn 1998 Green Day won their first MTV Video Music Award for Best Alternative Video for \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" and they were also nominated for Viewer's Choice.\n\nThe video can be found on their music video compilation DVD, International Supervideos!.\n\nGood Riddance (Time of Your Life) was voted #37 on the VH1 Classic's countdown VH1's Classic 100 Greatest Songs of the 90's\n\n\nReleased - December 23, 1997\nFormat - CD\nRecorded - 1997\nGenre - Acoustic rock, soft rock\nLength - 2:35\nLabel - Reprise\nProducer - Rob Cavallo, Green Day\nCertification - Gold (RIAA) <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Green+Day/_/Good+Riddance+(Time+of+Your+Life)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It went on to be released as the second single released from Dookie, after \"Longview\". The Dookie version was later included on their 2001 greatest hits album International Superhits!. The song is based on the band's experience moving out of their parents' houses and into an abandoned house in Oakland, CA where the band members, along with several others, lived without paying rent. The house was quite broken-down but to them it became home, and this sentiment is described in the song.\n\nBillie Joe Armstrong said this of the song:\n\u201c \tIt's about West Oakland, living in a warehouse with a lot of people, a bunch of artists and musicians, punks and whatever just lived all up and down, bums and junkies and thugs and gang members and stuff that just lived in that area. It's no place you want to walk around at night, but it's a neat warehouse where you can play basketball and stuff. \t\u201d\n\nThe opening riff of the song is reminiscent of the Ramones' \"Blitzkrieg Bop\", if one were to take the same chords but play the progression backwards using the same rhythm. The song is played with the guitar tuned a half-step down, as are all their Dookie songs.\n\nA live version of the song can be found on the Foot in Mouth EP and the Live Tracks EP. The song is also featured in the movie Surf's Up.\n\n\nTracklist\n\n   1. \"Welcome to Paradise\" - 3:45\n   2. \"Chump (live)\" - 2:44\n   3. \"Emenius Sleepus\" - 1:44\n\n    * (Track 2 recorded March 11, 1994 at Jannus Landing, St. Petersburg, Florida)\n\n\nReleased - October 1994\nFormat - CD, Vinyl\nRecorded - 1993\nGenre - Punk rock\nLength - 3:44\nLabel \tWEA International, Reprise Records <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Green+Day/_/Welcome+to+Paradise\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His real name is Jimmy, which is revealed in the extended music video when a girl calls him that and in the cut version of the video when he writes \"Saint Jimmy\" on a bathroom stall.\n\n The name \"Jesus of Suburbia\" may just mean he is the savior of the rebels in suburbia. He is a resident of Jingletown, USA, and the son of a divorced mother. His younger years were spent on a \"steady diet of soda pop and Ritalin\", watching television, using drugs, and loitering in front of convenience stores. Although everything seems alright at first, Jimmy feels trapped and bored in Jingletown and longs for escape, as he narrates in \"City of the Damned\".\n\nIn a coming of age move, Jimmy leaves Jingletown by the end of the song to explore The City. His exploits in The City are not described in this song, but are described in greater detail in the rest of the album, especially in \"Holiday\" and \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\". Nevertheless, to describe the essence of the personality of Jimmy, Green Day proclaims, \"I'm the son of rage and love.

The song was the band's first #1 on the Modern Rock chart, in a career that contained many chart-toppers on this chart. The music video for this song received intense airplay on MTV, which is largely credited for breaking Green Day into mainstream popularity.[citation needed] The lyrics describe intense boredom and are about a day spent sitting around the house, doing absolutely nothing of importance, masturbating until it is no longer fun, having no job, and no life. The song captured the attention of many youth at the time with its overt allusions to masturbation. Bassist Mike Dirnt has stated that the famous bass line intro to this song was written one night while he was high on acid, and what remains on the album is what he and lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong could recall in the morning.\n\nConcept\n\n\"It's about boredom, masturbation and smoking dope.\" - Billie Joe Armstrong\n\n\"I guess it was just living in the suburbs in a sort of shit town where you can't even pull in a good radio station. I was living in Rodeo, California, about 20 minutes outside of Oakland. There was nothing to do there, and it was a real boring place.\" - Billie Joe Armstrong in an interview in Guitar Legends magazine, May 2005.\n\n\"When Billie gave me a shuffle beat for Longview, I was frying on acid so hard. I was laying up against the wall with my bass lying on my lap. It just came to me. I said, \"Bill, check this out. Isn't this the wackiest thing you've ever heard?\" Later, it took me a long time to be able to play it, but it made sense when I was on drugs.\" - Mike Dirnt in Rolling Stone magazine, 1995.\n\nIt is said that the name of a song came about after the band took a trip to Longview, Washington where they first played this song. - according to Jim Baltutis, their press agent for the concert.\n\n\nIn 1995, Green Day was nominated for Grammys for Best New Artist and Best Hard Rock Performance for \"Longview\".\n\nThis song can also be found on their 2001 greatest hits collection International Superhits and a live performance can be found on the Bullet in a Bible DVD.\n\n\nMusic video\n\nThe video takes place in a dimly-lit basement unit of a house in Berkeley, California that the band used to live in. The band members say that the look was intentionally grungy. This was Green Day's first music video and was directed by Mark Kohr. Cinematography was by Adam Beckman. The video was edited by Bob Sarles, who also edited ZZ Top's \"Legs\" music video. The \"Longview\" music video was produced by Robert Caruso of Commotion Pictures for Warner Bros. Records. The video was nominated for three MTV Video Music Awards in 1994: Best Group Video, Best Alternative Video, and Best New Artist.\n\n\nReleased - June 6, 1994\nFormat - CD\nRecorded - 1993\nGenre - Punk rock\nLength - 3:59\nLabel - WEA International, Reprise\nProducer - Rob Cavallo\n\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Green+Day/_/Longview\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The two songs are transitional: \"Brain Stew\" ending and moving right into \"Jaded\" without the music stopping. They are tracks 10 and 11 on both Insomniac (the band's second major-label album, and fourth overall) and the 2001 greatest-hits album, International Superhits!. The two were very popular, and they became an alternative rock radio staple.\nThe composition of \"Brain Stew\" is relatively simple. The song contains only five power chords, five bass notes, and a relatively simple drum pattern. Many of Green Day's fans consider it to be one of their first songs to appear in the repertoire of many garage bands. Billie Joe Armstrong has stated that he used as many as 10 guitar overdubs to achieve the scratchy dissonant sounds in the latter part of the song.\n\nThe intro to \"Panic Song\" is often played in between \"Brain Stew\" and \"Jaded\" at live performances, although the key is changed to be relevant with the songs.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Green+Day/_/Brain+Stew\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It\u2019s about liberating yourself from a lot of bullshit that you see on TV.\u201d\n\nA music video for this song will be out with the release of the song on April 24, 2009. It will be the first global cross-channel video premi\u00e8re for MTV and VH1 networks.\n\nThe first play of song occurred on Sara Cox's BBC Radio 1 show at 10:00AM GMT. 93.3 WMMR debuted the song on the 'Preston and Steve show' at 7:05AM. A 90 second clip of the band playing the song was featured at the opening teaser of the NCAA 2009 Men's Basketball Championship game on April 6, 2009. The 90-second clip featured scenes from the music video intercut with scenes from the basketball season. The clip is now available for view on both YouTube and the official Green Day website, after being put up and taken down repeatedly. A short preview clip can be found on Green Day's official website. It was made available for internet download on April 16, 2009. In addition, a 90 second clip of the song was posted on the bands' MySpace page on April 6th, 2009. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Green+Day/_/Know+Your+Enemy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He declares that he doesn't care about anything anymore, he has no purpose and no will. His life has no meaning and he \"steps in line to walk amongst the dead\". The song is often seen as a description of life in punk style.\n\nAside from being an ode to indifference, this song could also be considered an expression of frustration associated with growing up. The narrator shows his desire to never grow up but stay young and immature forever, protecting himself from the pressures of the adult world. He kills his misery in constant intoxication, which causes the rain of apathy to get him closer and closer to drowning - but he doesn't mind because he would rather drown in apathy than face real life.\nAnother view is one of an addict. A true \"burnout\" who is hitting rock bottom but too apathetic and/or high to care. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Green+Day/_/Burnout\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Where some songwriters trade in subtlety and dancing around blunt truths with clever feints and metaphor, Clark aims his words straight to the point and, when needed, right through the heart. His music is unrelentingly direct and hard-hitting, too, charged with a palpable rock \u2018n\u2019 roll immediacy that\u2019s as evident in his most intimate solo acoustic performances as it is in the full-tilt band shows that have packed rooms across his native Lone Star State from the Blue Light in Lubbock to the world\u2019s biggest honky- tonk, Billy Bob\u2019s Texas in Fort Worth. And with the April 21st release of \u2018Ringling Road,\u2019 his eagerly awaited fourth album, Green is set to make his biggest impact on the booming Texas/Red Dirt music scene \u2014 and beyond \u2014 yet.<p>But just don\u2019t call him the \u201cNext Big Thing,\u201d because as Green makes patently clear on \u2018Ringling Road\u201ds riotously myth-busting opening track, that\u2019s a laugh, buddy. And even with tongue firmly in cheek, William Clark Green is only interested in being real.<p>\u201cOh it\u2019s hard to pay your dues when there ain\u2019t no money in the bank It\u2019s a shame<br> I gotta make it to the show but there ain\u2019t no gas in the tank<br> It\u2019s insane<br> what you do for a broken heart and some busted strings And everybody saying I\u2019m the next big thing!\u201d<p>\u201cI\u2019m actually a little nervous about what people are going to think of that song, and if they\u2019ll think I\u2019m being an asshole,\u201d Clark admits with a laugh. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not the case at all, because it\u2019s actually sarcastic as hell. But we\u2019ve been hearing that \u2018you\u2019re the next big thing\u2019 thing for a long time now \u2014 and I\u2019m guilty of saying the same to some of my songwriter friends who are struggling out there, too. And even though it\u2019s always meant in a nice way, you can\u2019t help but think, \u2018What? I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019m actually sleeping in my truck tonight!\u201d<p>Not that he\u2019s complaining. Green is nothing if not fully committed to his chosen path. Granted, had a few chips fallen a little differently, he could have just as easily \u2014 and happily \u2014 devoted his life to ranching, but fate dictated pretty early on that he was meant to be a troubadour. He may have started taking guitar lessons at 13 primarily out of boredom \u2014 his family had just moved from Flint, Texas to College Station in the summer, and he didn\u2019t have any new school friends yet \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t long before he developed a keen interest in songwriting. A healthy obsession with his father\u2019s copy of Willis Alan Ramsay\u2019s classic 1972 debut had a lot to do with that (\u201cThat\u2019s still the best album I\u2019ve ever heard, and the reason I use three names,\u201d Green enthuses). So did timing: \u201cI remember seeing Robert Earl Keen and Pat Green and even Jerry Jeff Walker at the Wolf Pen Creek Amphitheater in College Station when I was in high school,\u201d he says. \u201cThe scene was really kind of in its birth then, and I was right there in the middle, paying attention and really intrigued by all of it.\u201d<p>College originally wasn\u2019t part of his game plan \u2014 \u201cI was a very poor student, and I still wanted to be a cowboy\u201d \u2014 but after a lead on a ranch-hand job fell through and a miserable two-week stint at a feed lot scared him straight, Green enrolled in junior college and eventually found his way to Texas Tech. He majored in agriculture economics, but spent more time songwriting and playing guitar at every open-mic night and hotel bar gig he could find than actually studying. By the time fellow Red Raider and Texas country rising star Josh Abbott handed him the keys to his Tuesday-night residency at the Blue Light, Green and his own band were on their way.<p>\u201cThat\u2019s when things got really serious for me,\u201d Green recalls. \u201cI came out with my first record [2008\u2019s \u2018Dangerous Man\u2019], and it kind of got to the point where I knew if I was going to pursue music, I\u2019d have to give it everything I had, because there\u2019s just no room for half-assing it in this business. School went to the wayside \u2014 I ended up graduating, but it took six years because music was my priority. And here I am now at 28 \u2014 about to release our fourth album and hoping to get to five before I\u2019m 30. That\u2019ll be a pretty quick turn around, but that\u2019s the goal.\u201d<p>The aforementioned \u201cnext big thing\u201d rumors started up in the wake of his second album, 2010\u2019s \u2018Misunderstood,\u2019 but it was 2013\u2019s \u2018Rose Queen\u2019 that proved his real breakthrough. Green recorded the album, produced by Rachel Loy in Nashville, at a real crossroads in his career \u2014 with momentum and high expectations at his back but barely enough money in the bank to foot the bill (and that only after a desperate call for help to angel investor Wade Bowen saved the day). \u201cIt was a huge leap of faith,\u201d Green says today, \u201cbut I told the band, \u2018We\u2019re going to pull out all the stops, and we\u2019re going to find a way to make exactly the record we want to make and need to make.\u201d The end result was a triumph, yielding Green\u2019s first three top-10 Texas Radio hits, including two chart-toppers in \u201cShe Likes the Beatles\u201d and \u201cHanging Around\u201d (the former also won \u201cSong of the Year\u201d honors at the fan-voted Lone Star Music Awards).<p>Of course, all of that set the bar even higher for the follow-up \u2014 and \u2018Ringling Road\u2019 delivers in spades. Returning to Nashville to team once again with Loy (Green calls working with the gifted up-and-coming producer \u201cthe best decision I\u2019ve ever made in my musical career\u201d), the band overcame a a couple of early setbacks \u2014 longtime drummer Jay Saldana had recently left for a new gig with Wade Bowen, followed by guitarist Steve Marcus breaking his arm a week before they went into the studio \u2014 to come through like champs under pressure. Saldana ended up coming back as a guest to drum on most of the record (along with new band member Ryan Garza), while the lead guitars duties were initially shared between Nashville session vet Kenny Greenberg and band friend Josh Serrato, recruited out of fellow Texas band Six Market Boulevard for what originally supposed to be \u201cfill-in\u201d duty. By the time Marcus\u2019 arm healed up enough for him to join the sessions halfway through, though, Serrato had been promoted from temp to full-time band member. Greenberg ended up staying on for the rest of the record as well.<p>\u201cAll three of those guys are monster talents on guitar, so It was a really incredible experience to have them all working with each other in the studio,\u201d Green marvels. \u201cIt all just happened the way it was supposed to, and we weren\u2019t going to get in the way of that!\u201d<p>With that formidable triple-guitar threat augmented by Green on acoustic, seasoned band member Cameron Moreland on bass and key assists from Loy and others on background vocals and a few other instrumental tracks, it\u2019s no wonder that \u2018Ringling Road\u2019 boasts the fullest sound of any WCG album to date. But as has been the case since day one of Green\u2019s career, it\u2019s the quality of his songs that ultimately makes the boldest statement. And it\u2019s not just the flat- out rockers (\u201cNext Big Thing\u201d) and irresistibly catchy, up-tempo numbers (\u201cSticks and Stones,\u201d \u201cCreek Don\u2019t Rise,\u201d \u201cGoing Home\u201d) that hit hard, either. Other highlights include \u201cOld Fashioned,\u201d a stirring elegy for a bygone Texas (\u201cThe interstate\u2019s pumping just like a vein full of California license plates\u201d), and the uproarious, Todd Snider-worthy title track, which takes its name from a real road in Green\u2019s current hometown of Eastland, Texas. Back in the day, the Ringling Bros. Circus used Eastland as a regular resting stop between shows, where the elephants and other animals were let off the train for a drink and the myriad circus folk would unwind and do whatever circus folk usually do on their nights off. As colorfully imagined by Green and co-writers Ross Cooper and Randal Clay, that was a helluva lot more wild and entertaining than the actual ticketed performances.<p>\u201cRoss is a good friend of mine from Lubbock, and Randal is a guy he met in Nashville who was actually a roustabout for 10 years,\u201d Green explains. \u201cI mean, what better way to write a song about the circus than to write it with a guy like that? Randal brought in a lot of truths about what really does happen behind the scenes in the circus. To be honest, after I told them about Eastland and the history of Ringling Road, he and Ross just got going on this tangent that was so good, I kind of just sat back and was like, \u2018keep going!&#39;\u201d<p>\u201cRingling Road,\u201d the song, may be a freak-show blast, but the rest of the album is hardly all fun and circus games. \u201cFinal This Time\u201d is a devastatingly frank post-mortem of a divorce Green witnessed between two close friends. \u201cFool Me Once\u201d and \u201cHey Sarah,\u201d two of the three songs (along with \u201cSticks and Stones\u201d) that Green wrote solo, are unflinching accounts of his own firsthand experiences at bad (or at least uncertain) love. And the lead single \u201cSympathy\u201d (already a No. 1 on Texas radio) offers anything but sympathy to a former lover looking for a shoulder to cry on.<p>Most brutal of all, though, is the hauntingly plaintive \u201cStill Think About You,\u201d in which the kind of sympathy Green does offer an ex comes laced with painfully bitter honesty: \u201cSorry that you fell in love with someone you could never inspire \u2026\u201d<p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m an asshole,\u201d Green says again, laughing. \u201cBut I feel like everybody has those selfish feelings sometimes, but they\u2019re never said in songs. I actually showed that song \u2014 I had the chorus written but still needed the verses \u2014 to Randy Rogers and Sean McConnell, and they both went, \u2018oh, that\u2019s not my style.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Well, maybe this is a terrible idea \u2026&#39;\u201d<p>Before giving up on it, though, Green showed it to one other trusted friend: Kent Finlay, songwriter\u2019s songwriter, founder of the legendary Cheatham Street Warehouse in San Marcos, Texas, and, not for nothing, Green\u2019s co-writer on \u2018Rose Queen\u201ds hit single \u201cHanging Around.\u201d Sage soul that he was, Finlay \u2014 who sadly passed away on March 2, 2015 after a long illness \u2014 took a shine to the unfinished song at first pitch.<p>\u201cI took it to Kent and said, \u2018I\u2019ve got this song, and no one seems to like it,&#39;\u201d Green recalls. \u201cBut I played what I had for him, and he went, \u2018Oh, I like that!\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Thank God, finally somebody does!\u2019 So we ended up finishing it together, and I\u2019m really glad we did.<p>\u201cTaking uncomfortable feelings like that and putting them to paper and writing songs about them \u2014 that\u2019s kind of been my staple, really,\u201d Green continues. \u201cAnd that song is about as true as it gets.\u201d<p>He pauses on that thought for a moment. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing,\u201d he adds with a laugh, \u201cbut I guess the truth prevails! And that makes me able to sleep at night.\u201d</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>", "title": "William Clark Green", "url": "http://littlerock.eventful.com/events/william-clark-green-/E0-001-098598962-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Stickyz Rock N Roll Chicken Shack", "date": "2018-01-19 21:00:00"}, {"city": "Marietta", "description": " Nourish your body with rejuvenating plant-based dishes. &quot;Eat Your Greens & Things&quot; is a signature Learn & Dine\u00a0class, designed by Quinnie&#39;s Kitchen, perfect for the beginner chef or anyone wanting to incorporate prepraring healthy, healing food with the highest nutrient contents into their lifestyle, that delights your palate and is also good for you.\u00a0Additionally, this course is designed for those who are curious about or are new to Raw Foods.\u00a0The Raw Food lifestyle does not have to mean living on salads, energy soups, and fruits.

Nothing could have told me that I would prepare, eat and most importantly LOVE, raw food. If you think you cannot eat without meat and enjoy the meal, you have another think coming! You have to try this for yourself! I cannot yet attest to the many benefits of a raw diet, but I can absolutely attest to the fact it is delicious! I am sick of wondering what I am going to &quot;Cook&quot; for dinner! So, I am challenging myself over the next 30 days not to &quot;COOK&quot; dinner and implement a RAW diet!

The band consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt, drummer Tr\u00e9 Cool and guitarist and backing vocalist Jason White, who became a full member after playing in the band as a session and touring guitarist for 13 years. Cool replaced former drummer John Kiffmeyer in 1990, prior to the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1992).\n\nGreen Day was originally part of the punk scene at the DIY 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were from the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, its major label debut Dookie released through Reprise Records became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands Sublime, Bad Religion, The Offspring and Rancid, with popularizing and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States.\n\nGreen Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997), and Warning (2000) did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, though they were still successful, with Insomniac and Nimrod reaching double platinum and Warning reaching gold status. The band's rock opera, American Idiot (2004), reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the United States. The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009 which achieved the band's best chart performance to date. 21st Century Breakdown was followed up by a trilogy of albums called \u00a1Uno!, \u00a1Dos!, and \u00a1Tr\u00e9! released in September, November and December 2012 respectively.\n\nThey are one of the world's best-selling groups of all time, having sold more than 75 million albums and singles worldwide. The group has won five Grammy Awards: Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", Best Rock Album for the second time for 21st Century Breakdown and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording. In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three Tony Awards: Best Musical, Best Scenic Design and Best Lighting Design, losing only the first. Also in 2010, Green Day were ranked number 91 in the VH1 list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\".\n\nIn 1987, friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, 15 years old at the time, formed a band called Sweet Children. Its first live performance took place on October 17, 1987 at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California. In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with Sean Hughes and the former Isocracy drummer John Kiffmeyer, also known as \"Al Sobrante\". As said in the film Punk's Not Dead, Armstrong cites the band Operation Ivy (which featured Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman of Rancid) as a major influence, and a group that inspired him to form a band.\n\nIn 1988, Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed the group to his label. In 1989, the band recorded its debut extended play, 1,000 Hours. Before 1,000 Hours was released, the group dropped the name Sweet Children; according to Livermore, this was done to avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby. The band adopted the name Green Day, due to their fondness for marijuana.\n\nLookout! would release Green Day's debut studio album, 39/Smooth in early 1990. Green Day would record two extended plays later that year, Slappy and Sweet Children, the latter of which included older songs that the band had recorded for the Minneapolis independent record label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records re-released 39/Smooth under the name 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, and added the songs from the band's first two EPs, Slappy, and 1,000 Hours. In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Sobrante left the East Bay area to attend college. The Lookouts drummer Tr\u00e9 Cool began filling in as a temporary replacement and later Cool's position as Green Day's drummer became permanent. The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993, and played a number of shows overseas in Europe. The band's second studio album Kerplunk sold 50,000 copies in the U.S.\n\nKerplunk's underground success led to a number of major record labels being interested in signing Green Day, and the band eventually left Lookout! and signed to Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo \"was the only person we could really talk to and connect with\". Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, \"I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.\" After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie.\n\n\nRecorded in three weeks, and released in February 1994, Dookie became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the songs \"Longview\", \"Basket Case\", and \"When I Come Around\", all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. At a September 9, 1994 performance at Hatch Memorial Shell in Boston, mayhem broke-out during the band's set (cut short to seven songs) and by the end of the rampage, 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. The band also joined the lineups of both the Lollapalooza festival and Woodstock '94, where they started an infamous mud fight. During the concert, a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions by pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day's growing publicity and recognition, and helped push its album to eventual diamond status. In 1995, Dookie won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and the band was nominated for nine MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year.\n\nIn 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, entitled \"J.A.R.\". The single debuted at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by the band's fourth studio album, Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response to the band's newfound popularity, compared to the more melodic Dookie. The album opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from Rolling Stone, which said \"In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.\" The singles released from Insomniac were \"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Stuck with Me\", \"Brain Stew/Jaded\", and \"Walking Contradiction\".\n\nThough the album did not approach the success of Dookie, it sold two million copies in the United States. In addition, the album won the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for \"Walking Contradiction\" got the band a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form, in addition to a Best Special Effects nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards. After that, the band abruptly cancelled a European tour, citing exhaustion.\n\nAfter a brief hiatus in 1996, Green Day began to work on a new album in 1997. From the outset, both the band and Cavallo agreed that the album had to be different from its previous albums. The result was Nimrod, an experimental deviation from the band's standard pop-punk brand of music. The new album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, surf rock, and ska, to an acoustic ballad. Nimrod entered the charts at number 10. The success of \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video. The song was also used in the second \"clip show\" episode of Seinfeld and on two episodes of ER.\n\nThe other singles released from Nimrod were \"Nice Guys Finish Last\", \"Hitchin' a Ride\" and \"Redundant\". The band made a guest appearance in an episode of King of the Hill entitled \"The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteberg\", which aired in 1997. In late 1997 and most of 1998, Green Day embarked on a tour in support of Nimrod. In 1999, the guitarist Jason White began supporting the band on the concerts as rhythm guitarist.\n\nIn 2000, Green Day released its sixth studio album Warning. In support of the album, the band participated in the Warped Tour in 2000. The band also had an independent tour to support the album in 2001. Critics' reviews of the album were varied. Allmusic gave it 4.5/5 saying \"Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying.\" Rolling Stone was more critical, giving it 3/5, and saying \"Warning... invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core's biggest-selling band?\" Though it produced the hit \"Minority\" and a smaller hit with \"Warning\", some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance, and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day's previous albums had reached a status of at least double platinum, Warning was only certified platinum.\n\nAt the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight of the awards that it was nominated for. The group won the awards for Outstanding Album (Warning), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (Warning), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter, and Outstanding Artist.\n\nThe release of two compilation albums, International Superhits! and Shenanigans, followed Warning. International Superhits and its companion collection of music videos, International Supervideos!. Shenanigans contained some of the band's b-sides, including \"Espionage\", which was featured in the film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.\n\nIn the spring of 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Blink-182 which was documented on the DVD Riding in Vans with Boys.\n\nIn the summer of 2003, the band went into a studio to write and record new material for a new album, tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines. After completing 20 tracks, the master recordings were stolen from the studio. Instead of re-recording the stolen tracks, the band decided to abandon the entire project and start over, considering the taken material to be unrepresentative of the band's best work. It was then revealed that a band called The Network was signed to Armstrong's record label Adeline Records with little fanfare and information. After the mysterious band released an album called Money Money 2020, it was rumored that The Network was a Green Day side project, due to the similarities in the bands' sounds. However, these rumors were never addressed by the band or Adeline Records, except for a statement on the Adeline website discussing an ongoing dispute between the two bands.\n\nGreen Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album Skull Ring in November 2003. On February 1, 2004 a new song, a cover of \"I Fought the Law\" made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl XXXVIII.\n\n\n\nThe resulting album, American Idiot (2004), debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the band's first album to reach number one, backed by the success of the album's first single, \"American Idiot\". The album was labeled as a punk rock opera which follows the journey of the fictitious \"Jesus of Suburbia\". The album depicts the modern American life under the control from an idiot ruler who let people be misinformed by media as well as inserted \"redneck agenda\". It gives different angles on an everyman, modern icons, and leaders on the topic. Released two months before U.S. President George W. Bush was reelected, the album became protest art. American Idiot won the 2005 Grammy for Best Rock Album. The band also won a total of seven awards out of eight awards for which they were nominated, including the Viewer's Choice Award in MTV Video Music Awards 2005.\n\nThrough 2005, the band toured in support of the album with nearly 150 dates (Longest tour in their career) visiting Japan, Australia, South America and the United Kingdom. While touring for American Idiot, they filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, which was voted 'The Best Show On Earth' in a Kerrang! Magazine Poll. These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD called Bullet in a Bible on November 15, 2005. This CD/DVD featured songs from American Idiot as well as songs from all its previous albums, except Kerplunk and 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours. The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band, and showed how the band prepared to put on the show. The final shows of its 2005 world tour were in Sydney and Melbourne in Australia, on December 14 and 17 respectively.\n\nOn August 1, 2005 Green Day announced that it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-Dookie material from Lookout! Records, citing a continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands.\n\nOn January 10, 2006 the band was awarded with a People's Choice Award as favorite musical group or band.\n\nGreen Day engaged in a number of other smaller projects in the time following the success of American Idiot. The group released an album under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs entitled Stop Drop and Roll!!! In 2008, the Foxboro Hot Tubs went on a mini-tour to promote the record, hitting tiny Bay Area venues including the Stork Club in Oakland and Toot's Tavern in Crockett, California.\n\nIn an interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album. The span of nearly five years between American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown was the longest gap between studio albums in Green Day's career. The band had been working on new material since January 2006. By October 2007, Armstrong had 45 songs written, but the band showed no further signs of progress until October 2008, when two videos showing the band recording in the studio with producer Butch Vig were posted on YouTube. The writing and recording process, spanning three years and four recording studios, was finally finished in April 2009.\n\n21st Century Breakdown, was released on May 15, 2009. The album received a mainly positive reception from critics, getting an average rating between 3 and 4 stars. After the release, the album reached number one in fourteen countries, being certified gold or platinum in each. 21st Century Breakdown achieved Green Day's best chart performance to date. The band started playing shows in California in April and early May. It was their first live show in about three years. Green Day went on a world tour that started in North America in July 2009 and continuing around the world throughout the rest of 2009 and early 2010.\n\nWal-Mart refused to carry the album as it contains a Parental Advisory sticker and requested that Green Day release a censored edition. The band members did not wish to change any lyrics on the album and responded by stating, \"There's nothing dirty about our record... They want artists to censor their records in order to be carried in there. We just said no. We've never done it before. You feel like you're in 1953 or something.\"\n\nIn 2009, the band met with award-winning director Michael Mayer and many cast and crew members of the Tony Award-winning musical Spring Awakening to create a stage version of the album American Idiot. American Idiot: The Musical opened in the Berkeley Repertory Theatre during the end of 2009. The show features an expanded story of the original album, with new characters such as Will, Extraordinary Girl, and Favorite Son. On April 20, 2010, American Idiot: The Musical opened on Broadway, and Green Day released the soundtrack to the musical, featuring a new song by Green Day entitled \"When It's Time\". In June 2010 the iTunes received the single \"When It's Time\".\n\nDuring the Spike TV Video Game Awards 2009, it was announced that Green Day was set to have its own Rock Band video game titled as Green Day: Rock Band, as a follow-up to the last band specific Rock Band game, The Beatles: Rock Band. The game features the full albums of Dookie, American Idiot, and 21st Century Breakdown as well as select songs from the rest of Green Day's discography.\n\nDuring the second leg of the 21st Century Breakdown World Tour the band had said that they are writing new material. In an interview with Kerrang! magazine, Armstrong spoke about the possible new album: \"We did some demos in Berlin, some in Stockholm, some just outside of Glasgow and some in Amsterdam. We wanted get [the songs] down in some early form.\" The band also stated that they were recording a live album during the entire tour on the last date of the tour in Mountain View, California, also before playing the song \"Cigarettes and Valentines\". In October 2010, Dirnt was interviewed by Radio W, mentioning that they have completed the writing process of the ninth studio album. In the interview, Dirnt also mentioned that a new live album will \"most likely\" be released. The live CD/DVD and CD/Blu-ray entitled Awesome as Fuck was released on March 22, 2011.\n\nDuring the end of 2011, the band played several secret shows (under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs) whose setlists consisted almost entirely of previously unheard songs. Green Day entered the studio and began recording new material in February 2012, later announcing a trilogy of albums titled \u00a1Uno!, \u00a1Dos!, and \u00a1Tr\u00e9! which would be released in the fall of 2012. The trilogy marked longtime touring guitarist Jason White's induction as the fourth member of the band. That summer Green Day played several festivals and promotional shows including the Rock en Seine festival in France, the Rock am See festival in Germany, and the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom.\n\n\u00a1Uno!, \u00a1Dos!, and \u00a1Tr\u00e9! were released on September 21, November 9, and December 7, 2012 respectively and were met with generally positive reviews. On January 22, 2013 the band announced that \u00a1Cuatro!, a documentary about the making of \u00a1Uno!, \u00a1Dos! and \u00a1Tr\u00e9!, would premiere on January 26 in Aspen, Colorado as part of the X Games FILM showcase, and would be released on DVD April 9, 2013. Another documentary was announced called Broadway Idiot which focuses on the creation on the American Idiot musical and Armstrong's run as playing the character of St. Jimmy. On March 10, 2013, Green Day began their 99 Revolutions Tour to support the trilogy. In June, Green Day broke Emirates Stadium attendance record with 60,000 tickets sold, in the United Kingdom. The band played Dookie from start to finish on several dates on their European leg, including during Reading Festival 2013 headline show.\n\nDemolicious, a compilation that album contains alternate versions and demos of songs from \u00a1Uno!, \u00a1Dos! and \u00a1Tr\u00e9! recorded during the studio sessions of these albums, was released on April 19, 2014, for Record Store Day. It also contains a previously unreleased song called \"State of Shock\" and an acoustic version of \"Stay the Night\", from \u00a1Uno!.\n\nSince 1991, members of the band have branched out past Green Day and have started other projects with other musicians. Notable related projects of Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder (which also features Green Day's guitarist Jason White), The Frustrators in which Mike Dirnt plays bass, and The Network, a collaboration between Green Day and members of the band, Devo in which all members play under fake stage names. Green Day has also released an album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! on May 20, 2008, under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs, they currently use this name to book secret shows. In late December 2011, Armstrong formed a new side band called The Boo along his wife Adrienne and their two sons.\n\nIn September 2006, Green Day collaborated with U2 and producer Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song \"The Saints Are Coming\", originally recorded by The Skids, with an accompanying video. The song was recorded to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians' instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the disaster.\n\nIn December 2006, Green Day and NRDC opened a web site in partnership to raise awareness on America's dependency on oil.\n\nGreen Day released a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", which was featured on the album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. The band performed the song on the season finale of American Idol. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2008 but lost to The White Stripes' \"Icky Thump\". That summer, the band appeared in a cameo role in The Simpsons Movie, where they perform the show's theme song. Their version was released as a single on July 24, 2007.\n\nIn 2009, the band collaborated with theatre director Michael Mayer to adapt their rock opera American Idiot into a one-act stage musical that premiered at the Berkeley Rep on September 15, 2009. The show then moved to Broadway on April 20, 2010.\n\nThe reviews of American Idiot: The Musical have been positive to mixed. Charles Isherwood of The New York Times wrote an enthusiastic review for the Broadway production. He called the show \"a pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions ... only to transcend them through the power of its music and the artistry of its execution, the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as anything I\u2019ve seen on Broadway this season. Or maybe for a few seasons past.\" Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald enjoyed the premise of the show but found that \"the music and message suffer in a setting where the audience is politely, soberly seated\".\n\nMichael Kuchiwara of the Associated Press found the show to be \"visually striking [and] musically adventurous\", but noted that \"the show has the barest wisp of a story and minimal character development\". Paul Kolnik in USA Today enjoyed the contradiction that Green Day's \"massively popular, starkly disenchanted album ... would be the feel-good musical of the season\". Time magazine's Richard Zoglin opined that the score \"is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered [yet] there's enough variety. ... Where the show fall short is as a fully developed narrative.\" He concluded that \"American Idiot, despite its earnest huffing and puffing, remains little more than an annotated rock concert. ... Still, [it] deserves at least two cheers \u2013 for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple, rock and Broadway.\" Peter Travers from Rolling Stone, in his review of American Idiot, wrote \"Though American Idiot carries echoes of such rock musicals as Tommy, Hair, Rent and Spring Awakening, it cuts its own path to the heart. You won\u2019t know what hit you. American Idiot knows no limits\u2014it's a global knockout.\" The musical has been nominated for three Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. It was also nominated for a number of Drama Desk Awards and Outer Critics Circle Awards.\n\nIn October 2009, a Green Day art project was exhibited at StolenSpace Gallery in London. The exhibition showed artworks created for each of the songs on 21st Century Breakdown, was supported by the band, and led by their manager Pat Magnarella. He explained in an interview that \"[Artists are] basically like rock bands. Most are creating their art, but don't know how to promote it.\" For Billie Joe Armstrong, \"Many of the artists... show their work on the street, and we feel a strong connection to that type of creative expression.\"\n\nOn April 13, 2011, a film version of American Idiot was confirmed. Michael Mayer, director of the Broadway musical, will be directing the film. It will be produced by Green Day, Pat Magnarella (Green Day's manager who also produced Bullet in a Bible, Awesome as Fuck, and Heart Like a Hand Grenade), Playtone (Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman) and Tom Hulce.\n\nOn January 23, 2013, it was announced that a documentary showing Armstrong's journey from punk rock to Broadway was to be released. Called Broadway Idiot and showing a lot of behind-the-scenes of the American Idiot musical production, the movie was directed by Doug Hamilton, veteran television journalist for CBS News' 60 Minutes and PBS documentaries such as Nova, Frontline and American Masters. A trailer was released on January 30, 2013. The documentary premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival on March 15, 2013.\n\nThe band has generated controversy over whether the band's musical style and major-label status constitutes as \"true punk\". In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, John Lydon, former front man of the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols commented:\n\n\"So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do.\"\n\nArmstrong himself has discussed the group's status of being a punk band on a major record label, saying \"Sometimes I think we've become totally redundant because we're this big band now, we've made a lot of money \u2013 we're not punk rock any more. But then I think about it and just say, 'You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you can't take the punk rock out of us.'\"\n\nOn September 21, 2012, while Green Day was performing at the iHeartRadio music festival, lead vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong stopped while performing Basket Case, because he believed their time was being shortened, possibly in order to extend R&B artist Usher's performance. Angered, Armstrong began ranting while a screen in the rear of the audience was labeled \"1 Minutes Left\", saying \"You're not gonna give me one fucking minute? You've gotta be fucking kidding me!\". He also told the crowd he was not Justin Bieber and labeled the festival as a \"joke\". When the screen went blank, Armstrong smashed his guitar, while bassist Mike Dirnt smashed his bass. Armstrong then gave the finger, and declared that Green Day would be back before throwing his microphone down and walking off the stage. Two days later, the band's representative apologized for the incident on their behalf stating that \"Green Day would like everyone to know that their set was not cut short by Clear Channel and to apologize to those they offended at the iHeartRadio Festival in Las Vegas\" also adding that Armstrong will be headed to rehab, for abuse of alcohol and prescription pills for anxiety and insomnia. However Mike Dirnt would later say in an interview with Rolling Stone that he agreed with what Billie Joe meant by his rant\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Green+Day\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Recorded and composed by Guetta, Rowland, Miriam Nervo, Olivia Nervo, and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer, and mixed by Veronica Ferraro, for Guetta's fourth studio album, One Love, the track was released digitally as the album's lead single in May 2009. The track became a number one smash, topping charts in the UK, Ireland, Italy, Belgium (Wallonia), Switzerland, Slovakia, and Turkey, and on the European Hot 100 Singles. It has charted within the top five of many other European countries, as well as charting in North America becoming Guetta's second Hot 100 hit, following \"Love is Gone\". The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category for Best Dance Recording for the 52nd Grammy Awards.  The song was also nominated for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical which was ultimately awarded to Guetta, becoming his first Grammy award.\n\nRowland met Guetta while attending one of his shows in Southern France during the summer of 2008. She later met up with him and asked him to show her one of his tracks and what he showed her was a \"pop number built around a lush piano loop and throbbing percussion\" which was the early works of \"When Love Takes Over\". The beat moved Rowland to tears. \"I felt so much emotion from the track; something happened the first time I heard it, and it was just beautiful\", she said. Guetta, meanwhile, is banking on the single to garner a stronger stateside following.\n\nAfter being moved by Guetta's track, Rowland took the song to London and began to work on lyrics with American Songwriter Terry Lef\u00e8vre-Han. The finished product was released in March at Miami's Ultra Music Festival. \"I had spent nights dancing in the South of France from 12:45 a.m. to 8 in the morning\", Rowland said, \"but I had never thought about recording a dance track myself. Hearing David's song made me consider taking on this whole new style.\" \"The track with Kelly has made me experiment with a more American urban influence\", Guetta says. \"Musically, it's opened a new world for me. It's pure pop with a lot of detail, and Kelly had this Whitney Houston vibe and nailed it.\"\n\nIn the United Kingdom, it was originally scheduled to be released digitally and physically on 15 June 2009. However, two other versions of the song by Airi L appeared and so the digital version was brought forward to 11 June 2009 instead.  \"When Love Takes Over\" debuted on the UK Singles Chart on 14 June 2009 at number seven. On 21 June 2009 the single climbed to number one, becoming Rowland's second number one as a featured artist in the UK and Guetta became the first French person (excluding people of French origin) to have a number one in UK charts.  It has also peaked at number one on the Irish Singles Chart.\n\nIn the U.S. the song gained popularity slowly, mainly due to heavy-airplay at radio-stations, the song has sold so far over 320,000 downloads, and after Guetta and Rowland appeared at the show So You Think You Can Dance, the song entered to the iTunes Top 100 Songs. The song is also his third #1 on the Billboard Hot Dance Airplay chart, and also becomes Guetta's first song played on adult contemporary radio stations.\n\nRowland and Guetta appeared at German show \u201cThe Dome\u201d. They\u2019ve received Gold Record for their #1 single \u201cWhen Love Takes Over\u201d.\n\nThe song has so far peaked at number 1 in 10 countries. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/David+Guetta/_/When+Love+Takes+Over\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Taken from the former's fifth studio album, Nothing but the Beat, the song was written by Sia Furler, Guetta, Giorgio Tuinfort and Afrojack. Production was also handled by Guetta, Tuinfort and Afrojack. \"Titanium\" was initially released for digital download on August 8, 2011, as the first of three promotional singles from the album. It was later released as the album's fourth single in December 2011. The song originally featured the vocals of American recording artist Mary J. Blige, whose version of the song leaked online in July 2011. Originally, Katy Perry was offered to feature on the song but turned it down.\n\n\"Titanium\" is a ballad which draws from the genres of pop, house and urban-dance. The song's lyrics are about inner strength. Sia's vocals on \"Titanium\" received comparisons to those by Fergie and the song was also musically compared to Coldplay's work. Critics were positive towards the song and noted it as one of the standout tracks from Nothing but the Beat. \"Titanium\" attained top 10 positions in several major music markets, including Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. In the United Kingdom, it peaked at number one, becoming Guetta's fifth number-one single on the chart and Sia's first. The song's accompanying music video premiered on December 21, 2011 but does not feature appearances by Guetta and Sia. Instead, the video focuses on a young boy, played by actor Ryan Lee, with supernatural powers. Guetta has performed the song with Scottish recording artist Emeli Sand\u00e9 at the 2012 NRJ Music Awards, and at the 2012 Coachella Festival with Sia.\n\n\"Titanium\" has been described as \"an emotional near-ballad\" that draws from the genres of pop, house and urban-dance. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is set in common time with a tempo of 126 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E-flat major with Sia's vocal range spanning from the note of G3 to the note of Eb5. According to Andrew Gregory of The Daily Telegraph, the song's intro features \"a hint of 80's flavour\". Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush noted that the song \"has the headache-inducing club beat, whining synths [and] atmospheric sound effects.\" Ben Norman of About.com noted that it \"incorporate(s) a strumming guitar ... before a staggering beat filters in, Sia's trademark pipes positively ooze with emotional inflection.\" The strumming guitar sounds were compared to those of \"Every Breath You Take\".\n\n\"Titanium\" has lyrics about inner strength, such as: \"I'm bulletproof, nothin' to lose / Fire away, fire away / Ricochet, you take your aim / Fire away, fire away / You shoot me down, but I won't fall / I am titanium.\" Al Fox of BBC Music wrote that on the song, Sia has \"ghostly mandolin-esque vocals\". Cameron Adams of Herald Sun called them \"square-peg\", while Melinda Newman of HitFix compared her vocals to those by Fergie. Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club wrote that on the song, Sia \"manage(s) to keep [her] head above the waves of synths ... by amping up [her] vocals to match the outsized beats.\" David Jeffries of Allmusic compared the song to the music of Coldplay. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/David+Guetta/_/Titanium\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In 2001, however, he went back to his first love: making music.\n\nLaunched by the single \"Just A Little More Love,\" an electro-funk-house cocktail featuring Chris Willis of the band Nashville on vocals, David Guetta\u2019s first album was released by Virgin in June 2002 and went on to sell 250,000 copies. This resounding success carried through in the album's second, even more devastating single, \"Love Don't Let Me Go,\" a track reminiscent of Moroder's techno-disco style crossed with Depeche Mode's new-wave sound.\n\nLike fellow Frenchman Laurent Garnier, David started off his career in the gay clubs around Paris. Les Halles district in the mid-80s, going on to make a name for himself in acid-house and hip-hop. His first album heralded the beginning of a new DJ career \u2013 this time on a global level. Named after the parties he hosts on Ibiza, the fabled isle of techno, David's \"F*** ME I'M FAMOUS: IBIZA DJ MIX\", which featured his remix of David Bowie's \"Heroes,\" went gold: no small feat for a compilation CD. For the last three years, David has been invited to mix throughout Europe on a regular basis and, more and more often, in the United States, Australia, Japan, Singapore and Israel as well. He is also resident DJ at The Cross in London, Barcelona \u2018s Discoteca and the Lausanne club Mad.\n\nPropelled by the rock guitars of the single Money, David\u2019s second album, GUETTA BLASTER, is even gutsier. David and Joachim Garraud (the first album\u2019s co-composer and co-producer) applied themselves to creating real songs modeled on electro-pop classics of the 80s by such masters as Depeche Mode, Yazoo, Dead Or Alive, and New Order, to name the most prominent influences. All the tracks on this second album are original compositions. The gospel sounds of Chris Willis and the stylings of guest vocalists JD Davis (lead singer of Sinema), James Perry (alias Jimmy Polo, renowned singer/producer on the Chicago scene) and Britain\u2019s Stereo MCs give the tracks a unique luster, while the production skills of Guetta and Garraud lift the album to new \u2013 and always spectacular \u2013 heights.\n\nFrom GUETTA BLASTER\u2019s opening salvos, \"Money and Stay,\" we get beats that are cranked up a notch beyond the hard-dance formula of \"Just A Little More Love.\" Without an ounce of hesitation, the album launches itself at the experimental roots of house music and cold-wave, displaying an unexpected stylistic versatility, then oscillates between powerful mixtures of hot & cold and black & white. The result is 100% addictive.\n\n\"Used To Be The One,\" with vocals by Willis, owes a debt to both Yazoo\u2019s Don't Go and garage music. Similarly, the counterpoint of Time evokes Eurythmics\u2019 Sweet Dreams, blending the best of English pop and dance culture \u2013 something David has mastered like no one else. Open Your Eyes, a track tailor-made for the Stereo MCs, is built on a rubbery break beat and an acid sequence, with a rap that brings their classic Connected to mind. The abrasive AC/DC, clearly a future hit on the underground/rave circuit, is like the missing link between Jeff Mills and Ministry of Sound.\n\nTwo velvet-smooth cuts neatly crown the album: \"In Love With Myself,\" a track that could hold its own against Moroder & Oakey\u2019s Electric Dreams any day, is followed by \"Higher,\" on which Chris Willis pays homage to the style of phrasing and embellishment popularized by Stevie Wonder, an approach that has proliferated in both R&B and garage/house music \u00e0 la New Jersey duo Blaze. GUETTA BLASTER drives its point home with the metronomic Movement Girl, featuring James Perry, and the killer Get Up, on which macho riffs, the hysterical falsetto of Chris Willis and screaming guitars swirl around a punchy beat.\nOn GUETTA BLASTER, David Guetta has not only successfully avoided the pitfalls of second albums \u2013 he has truly launched himself into a new dimension.\nThe song \"Just A Little More Love\" appeared in the film The Football Factory, was sung in the Gospel version at the 2006 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.\nOn New Year's Day 2007 he appeared at Big Beach Boutique 3, a concert held on the beach of Brighton, UK, put together by and headlined by Fatboy Slim.\nHis fourth album is \"Pop Life\" released in France on 23 April, 2007 with the leading single\n\"Love is gone.\"\n\n24. August 2009. he released \"One Love\". He introduces this album with the hit singles \"When Love Takes Over\" feat. Kelly Rowland and \"Sexy Bitch/Chick\" feat. Akon. He wanted to make a new music stream named House Pop or Hip House. In this album he worked with well known vocalists, producers and DJs like Chris Willis, Estelle, Kid Cudi, Novel, Ne-Yo, Will I Am & Apl De Ap from The Black Eyed Peas, Lil' John, DJ Chuckie, Abel Ramos, Koen Groenveld, Afrojack, DJ Footloose, Joachim Garraud and others. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/David+Guetta\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Along with many other songs on this album, Charli expresses herself through speak-rap and a catchy hip-hoppy beat with this lovestruck tune. She talks about the one guy who understands her, and does everything that she is interested in, all the while he treats her right and they have a good time. This song is speculated to be about film and music video director Ryan Andrews, with whom Charli was involved in at the time of this song\u2019s release. He also happened to be the director for several of her music videos, including the one for this song!\n\n\u201cWhat I Like\u201d was officially released as True Romance\u2019s fifth single on May 17th, 2013, a little bit over a month after the album\u2019s release. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Charli+XCX/_/What+I+Like\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Performing nationally from large theaters and dive bars, to art galleries, dingy basements, and even children&#39;s television shows, the leather-clad masked monstrosity continues to attract and confuse audiences varying from dance party club kids to heavy metal beer guzzlers. PLACK BLAGUE&#39;s sound emits a vile combination of primitive Industrial noise, sadistic Body Music, and throbbing dance beat party vibes. The live performance is a &quot;must see&quot; spectacle of homoerotic Leathersexual delusions of grandeur mixed with muscle flexing tantrums of harsh noise and electronic disco. Plack Blague was recently featured in Out Magazine, which also premiered the latest music video for Just Another Man of the Street. The summer of 2017 also brought a brand new album Blague called Night Trax, which was released by the NYC hip hop/Noise label Ormolycka.

She signed to Asylum Records in 2010, and released two mixtapes, Heartbreaks and Earthquakes and Super Ultra, in 2012. \n\nCharli XCX's major label debut album, True Romance, was released in 2013, accompanied by singles including \"You (Ha Ha Ha)\" and \"Nuclear Seasons\". She rose to prominence during 2013 and 2014 when she co-wrote and was featured on two successful singles, Icona Pop's \"I Love It\" and Iggy Azalea's \"Fancy\". Her 2014 single \"Boom Clap\" from the soundtrack album of The Fault in Our Stars became a top ten single in a number of countries. It also preceded the release of her second album, Sucker, which featured the singles \"Break the Rules\", \"Doing It\" and \"Famous\".\n\nIn a July 2015 interview, Charli XCX said that she was working on her third album and described it as \"the most pop thing, and the most electronic thing\" she had ever done. British producer SOPHIE has been confirmed to be involved in the album's production, along with other producers, such as BloodPop and Stargate. In early 2016, Charli set up a new record label, Vroom Vroom Recordings, and released an EP titled Vroom Vroom, as the teaser for her third studio album.\n\nCharli XCX has toured alongside artists and bands such as Ellie Goulding, Marina and the Diamonds (whom she has also collaborated with), Paramore, Bleachers, Azealia Banks and Coldplay during her career. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Charli+XCX\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Their experimental fusion of electronica and classical mustve seemed like odd bedfellows back when they first played at their own National Rail Disco while still studying at University, but they immediately recognized their potential mass appeal.Such resolute self-belief was vindicated in awe-inspiring style. Their debut album New Eyes raced to 1.6 million sales, and was propelled by 12 million sales of their omnipresent global hit Rather Be which was the worlds second biggest-selling track of 2014. The awards soon followed: a Grammy for Best Dance Recording and then two Ivor Novellos wins for the bands multi-instrumentalist/producer, Jack Patterson, for Best Contemporary Song and Most Performed Work.The inevitable question that chases such success is simple how do you follow it? Clean Bandits answer was a back-to-basics approach.Its about being able to recognize that a song works as a piece of sheet music and a chord structure like how a jazz standard has a chord structure, a melody and lyrics, explains the bands dominant creative force Jack Patterson. You can that produce and render that however you want. Its making sure that all of the songs have that solid foundation.Its a total contrast to how we made the first album, where it was all produced as it was written, adds cellist Grace Chatto. Its an approach that was particularly evident with Telephone Banking, in which their collaborator Love Ssega wrote the lyrics during its video shoot.This creative process resulted in Clean Bandits anthemic 2016 comeback single Tears, which evolved from a minimalistic piano / vocal composition into the richly layered production which became their fifth domestic Top 5 hit when it was released earlier this summer; the single has reached over 80 million streams and is one of the most successful single releases of this year.Written by Jack and Sam Romans, an early version of Tears found its way to Simon Cowell who called Jack to ask if his X-Factor winner Louisa Johnson could perform it. His initial reticence was countered by Graces enthusiasm for Louisas talents, and soon both Jack and drummer Luke (the younger of the two Patterson siblings) were enthralled by her performance.Always eager to collaborate with new vocalists, Clean Bandits second new track - the dancehall-tinged Rockabye - featured an especially striking presence in the shape of Sean Paul.Why? Because weve always wanted to with him, smiles Grace. Temperature and Breathe were such big songs for me growing up. Jack and I went to his gig in Shepherds Bush in 2013 and gave him our first EP. We both wanted to do something, but weve literally been on tour for three years and hes been really busy as well. Eventually he and Jack got together, and Sean Paul recorded an amazing verse for it.Its story of a single mother battling to do her best for her child resonated with many people who lived through similar experiences. Also featuring the soaring vocals of Anne-Marie, Rockabye has provided the bands second UK #1 almost three years after Rather Be had first conquered the charts. Moreover, aside from X Factor alumni, the single is the first UK #1 by a UK act in 2016 and now heralds Clean Bandit as one of just two UK artists to land two UK Top 5 singles this year.Im really into dancehall music at the moment, so Rockabye is really special and I want to make more songs like that, declares Grace, adding that shes appreciative of co-writer Ina Wroldsens contribution to the track. It also has a super-hot sweet Scandinavia sound with a reggae element thats reminiscent of a lot of the early nineties music that I love.The trio have strived to incorporate fresh sounds and textures into Clean Bandits emerging songbook. In addition to Graces love of dancehall, Jack has been inspired by the confident, pure and very bold production of Frank Oceans Blonde album, while both Patterson brothers have experimented with modular synthesizers and acoustic sax techniques. Those ideas have to work within a coherent album, asserts Jack. Theres no point in just throwing that in for the sake of it.Thematically, the rest of the new tracks follow the deeper themes that were presented in Rockabye. As Grace observes, The lyrics are a lot darker but the music is full of full and joy, whereas the first album was often the other way around particularly with Rather Be, the lyrics are so pure and happy, but you can hear sadness in the music. Weve always been interested in juxtaposing different feelings within the music.Its a stance reiterated with the upbeat Disconnect which features Marina and the Diamonds. Grace interprets the song within the context of a break-up. Youre constantly on the phone, looking up the person and wondering what theyre doing. You need to let go and disconnect from a relationship, but its so hard.It feels very relevant, opines Jack. Its talking about young people who seem to be completely consumed by technology to the extent where its suffocating them. While the bands debut album New Eyes magnified the attention on a range of rising talents, most notably Jess Glynne, the new songs boast a plethora of big names. Theres Sir Elton John, who introduced himself at a party by serenading his new friends with Rather Be; they all praise Craig Davids almost supernaturally precise vocal gift; and Zara Larsson provides the exuberant energy of musics current breed of talent.One person who isnt present, however, is founding member Neil Amin-Smith who recently quit the band after a decade together. We knew something wasnt quite right, states Luke. But it was a major shock when it happened, interjects Jack. I felt sick and really sad.Grace: It was a decision that he didnt take lightly, but he was always one to do other things. After ten years, it was his time to do something else. Hes definitely irreplaceable.His exit is undoubtedly a blow, but its also one that has precedence in Clean Bandit history. The departure of vocalist Love Ssega felt like a devastating blow at the time, but it set Clean Bandit on a path towards collaborating with a variety of different singers. Indeed, as Ssega has recently returned for live shows, it feels as if the door will remain open should Amin-Smith want to return in some capacity in the future.In the hectic life of a working band shows, promotion and the myriad range of other activities that come unexpectedly along the way moments of triumph can arrive in spectacularly mundane circumstances. News that Rather Be had topped the charts was received by text as the band drove back from a gig in Manchester. For Jack it felt like a weird, Christmas-type feeling, but it was a lot for the then 21-year-old Luke to come to terms with.I just really wasnt ready for it, he admits. It was never my goal. It was something that had happened that was completely out of my control and I was quite scared. He soon adjusted to the situation. It wasnt so bad in all honesty, he says with a glint in his eye, because its not so bad being number one!As their reputation expanded exponentially from continent-to-continent, their world became ever stranger. Grace remembers a surreal moment being recognized in a small shop in Tokyo, and Luke is still struck by arriving in Jakarta to find so many fans waiting for them that they needed a police escort in order to get to their hotel where what they thought was going to be straightforward interview instead turned out to be a press conference that recalled the mania of The Beatles heyday.Fast-forward to Los Angeles: February 2015. Its the Grammy Awards and Clean Bandit have just won Best Dance Recording from a Britcentric list of nominees which includes their old friends Disclosure and Basement Jaxx. And yet as anyone can see the award has been accepted by someone who most definitely isnt Clean Bandit.We had no idea that we were going to win it, it felt like an absolute long shot, recalls Jack. And then Wes Clark, a mix engineer, ran up and accepted the award for us because he thought we werent there, even though we were like ten meters away from him.It was quite chaotic, summarizes Luke, before Jack corrects him: It was quite annoying!Nonetheless, such an accolade means that its time to cut loose. Clean Bandit DJed at wild, celeb-packed scenes at the official Warner party at Chateau Marmont before heading to Sam Smiths bash in the Hollywood Hills where Luke was the last man standing. Ive never seen you look such a state in my whole life, chuckles Jack as Luke looks as sheepish as he surely did the next morning. As well as representing a landmark achievement for years of dedication, a Grammy forecasts a glowing future for Clean Bandit in which anything is possible. Theyre keen to keep pushing themselves, as evidenced by both their excitement for the expansion of their live band and by Grace and Lukes passion for directing their videos. Clean Bandit have carved their own distinct niche in music, and fans the world over have embraced their individuality.", "title": "Clean Bandit", "url": "http://eventful.com/newhaven/events/clean-bandit-/E0-001-103759984-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "College Street Music Hall", "date": "2018-04-14 20:00:00"}, {"city": "Portland", "description": null, "title": "Clean Bandit", "url": "http://portland.eventful.com/events/clean-bandit-/E0-001-107776949-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Crystal Ballroom", "date": "2018-03-28 20:00:00"}, {"city": "Brisbane", "description": " Customers have to be over 18 to attend this event. <strong>Please note you must present a valid Photo ID to gain entry.</strong> ", "title": "Clean Bandit", "url": "http://brisbane.eventful.com/events/clean-bandit-/E0-001-108824473-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "Australia", "venue": "Eatons Hill Hotel", "date": "2018-01-25 19:30:00"}, {"city": "Sydney", "description": " Customers have to be over 18 to attend this event. <strong>Please note you must present a valid Photo ID to gain entry.</strong> ", "title": "Clean Bandit", "url": "http://sydney.eventful.com/events/clean-bandit-/E0-001-108824469-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "Australia", "venue": "Metro Theatre", "date": "2018-01-26 00:00:00"}, {"city": "Osaka", "description": " \n", "title": "Clean Bandit", "url": "http://eventful.com/osaka/events/clean-bandit-/E0-001-108952300-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "Japan", "venue": "Nanba-Hatch", "date": "2018-01-18 19:00:00"}, {"city": "Santa Ana", "description": null, "title": "Clean Bandit", "url": "http://orangecounty.eventful.com/events/clean-bandit-/E0-001-107737393-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "The Observatory", "date": "2018-03-31 20:00:00"}, {"city": "Chicago", "description": null, "title": "Clean Bandit", "url": "http://chicago.eventful.com/events/clean-bandit-/E0-001-107777005-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Vic Theatre", "date": "2018-04-11 19:30:00"}], "description": "Clean Bandit are a British electronic group formed in 2009 .

Released as the third single from (What's the Story) Morning Glory? in October 1995, \"Wonderwall\" peaked at number two in the UK Singles Charts and proved to be their American breakthrough, reaching number eight on the Hot 100 and giving them their only top-ten hit in the US . \"Wonderwall\" is perhaps their most popular song, despite the fact that British TV stars Robson & Jerome's \"I Believe\"/\"Up on the Roof\" kept it out of the top slot. \"Wonderwall\" continues to have enduring popularity in Oasis' canon; as of 2008, it was 76th in the UK's list of best-selling singles, and has now sold over a million copies in single and download sales in the UK, where it went platinum.\n\nThe song takes its name from the 1968 album Wonderwall Music by George Harrison, at the time still a member of The Beatles. Harrison's album was in fact a soundtrack to the film Wonderwall, but the film has remained unknown by the general public. The original title of the track was \"Wishing Stone\".\n\nIt is often claimed that \"Wonderwall\" was written for Gallagher's then-girlfriend, Meg Mathews. Gallagher married Mathews in 1997, but the couple divorced four years later. Gallagher now claims that the song was not about Mathews at all, but he felt he had to go along with the rumour, saying \"The meaning of that song was taken away from me by the media who jumped on it. How do you tell your Mrs it's not about her once she's read it is? It's a song about an imaginary friend who's gonna come and save you from yourself.\"\n\nIn 2008 Liam Gallagher was quoted as saying about the song: \"I can't fucking stand that fucking song! Every time I have to sing it I want to gag. Problem is, it was a big, big tune for us.\"\n\nThe song is included on Oasis' compilation album Stop the Clocks.\n\n    * In the Grammy Awards of 1997 the band received a nomination for Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group and Noel Gallagher picked another nomination for Best Rock Song, winning none.\n\n    * In May 2005, \"Wonderwall\" was voted the best British song of all time, in a poll of over 8,500 listeners conducted by Virgin Radio. \n\n    * In August 2006, \"Wonderwall\" was named the second-greatest song of all time in a poll conducted by Q Magazine, finishing behind another Oasis song, \"Live Forever\".\n\n    * In 2006, U2's guitarist The Edge named \"Wonderwall\" one of the songs he most wishes he'd written.\n\n    * In May 2007, NME magazine placed \"Wonderwall\" at number 27 in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/_/Wonderwall\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The seven-minute anthem is the closing track on the record-breaking album (What's the Story) Morning Glory?. Only though released as a single in Australia, France and the United States, a music video directed by Nigel Dick was released to the music channels and, as a result, the song received much television and radio airplay. The song achieved U.S. success, becoming the band's second #1 single on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.\n\nThe song is considered a fan-favourite, and has received widespread critical acclaim. Noel Gallagher claimed, in a 2005 interview, that he has still not made up his mind as to what the song actually is about, though he thinks it might be about reincarnation.\n\nAccording to Songfacts, Noel Gallagher got the title when he misheard the name of the Pixies album Bossanova. He was watching a documentary about champagne at the time.\n\nCheck out http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=3495/ for more trivia & information on Champagne Supernova. \n\nNoel Gallagher then had this to say about the song's lyrical content on the bands official website:\n\n    Some of the lyrics were written when I was out of it. There's the words: 'Someday you will find me/ Caught beneath a landslide/ ln a Champagne Supernova in the sky'. That's probably as psychedelic as I'll ever get. It means different things when I'm in different moods. When I'm in a bad mood being caught beneath a landslide is like being suffocated. The song is a bit of an epic. It's about when you're young and you see people in groups and you think about what they did for you and they did nothing. As a kid, you always believed the Sex Pistols were going to conquer the world and kill everybody in the process. Bands like The Clash just petered out. Punk rock was supposed to be the revolution but what did it do? Fuck all. The Manchester thing was going to be the greatest movement on earth but it was fuck all. When we started we decided we weren't going to do anything for anybody, we just thought we'd leave a bunch of great songs. But some of the words are about nothing. One is about Bracket The Butler who used to be on Camberwick Green, or Chipley or Trumpton or something. He used to take about 20 minutes to go down the hall. And then I couldn't think of anything that rhymed with 'hall' apart from 'cannonball'. so I wrote 'Slowly walking down the hall/ Faster than a cannonball' and people were like, 'Wow, fuck , man'. There's also the line 'Where were you while we were getting high?' because that's what we always say to each other. But the number of people who've started clubs called Champagne Supernova is fucking unbelievable. And the album isn't even released yet.\n\nIn a 2009 interview, Noel told the following anecdote:\n\n    This writer, he was going on about the lyrics to \"Champagne Supernova\", and he actually said to me: \u2018You know, the one thing that\u2019s stopping it being a classic is the ridiculous lyrics.\u2019 And I went: \u2018What do you mean by that?\u2019 And he said: \u2018Well, Slowly walking down the hall, faster than a cannonball \u2014 what\u2019s that mean?\u2019 And I went: \u2018I don\u2019t fucking know. But are you telling me, when you\u2019ve got 60,000 people singing it, they don\u2019t know what it means? It means something different to every one of them.\u2019\n\nPaul Weller, former frontman of The Jam and friend of Oasis, provided the lead guitar and some of the backing vocals on the track, making it one of the rare times someone other than the Gallagher brothers provided backing vocals on an Oasis song.\n\nThe song is included on Oasis' compilation album Stop the Clocks.\n\n\"Champagne Supernova\" is claimed by Greg Kot and Jim DeRogatis of the Chicago Public Radio show Sound Opinions to be the number one song to hum to yourself when another song is stuck in your head. The other song will be unstuck, but the drawback is that you will then have \"Champagne Supernova\" stuck in you head due to its infectious and memorable melody.\n\nThe song is played at the majority of Oasis concerts. Noel Gallagher has stated that \"I think it's the only song, that since it was written, that we've played every night.\" During the Morning Glory Tour in 1995/96 and the Be Here Now Tour in 1997/98 the song's ending was usually stretched out by often 5 or so minutes, with Noel Gallagher playing a long improvised guitar solo. An example of one of these performances can be seen on the DVD \"...There and Then\".\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/_/Champagne+Supernova\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Inspired by The Rolling Stones' \"Shine a Light,\" \"Live Forever\" features a basic song structure and lyrics with an optimistic outlook that contrasted with the attitude of the grunge bands popular at the time. The song was the first Oasis single to enter the top ten in the United Kingdom, and garnered critical acclaim.\n\nThis song is about Gallagher's optimistic view on life, contrasting himself and Kurt Cobain.

B-side \"Talk Tonight\" \"Acquiesce\" \"Headshrinker\" Released On: 24th April 1995 The music video for the..."}, "description": "\"Some Might Say\" is a song by British rock band Oasis, written by the band's lead guitarist Noel Gallagher. It was the first single to be released from their definitive second album (What's the Story) Morning Glory ? in 1995, and provided the band with their first #1 in the UK Singles Chart (see 1995 in British music).\n\nThe track was apparently inspired by the Small Faces and/or T-Rex. It was the last Oasis track to feature original drummer Tony McCarroll, who was asked to leave the band before the main recording sessions for (What's the Story) Morning Glory ? when tensions arose between McCarroll and the Gallagher brothers. The rest of the tracks on the album feature Alan White on drums.\n\nThe sleeve artwork, shot at Cromford railway station in Derbyshire, England, features art director Brian Cannon's father with wheelbarrow and his mother with mop. Also pictured are Matthew Sankey, Cannon's aide and Carla Knox, barmaid of his local pub. Liam Gallagher can be seen on the bridge whilst Noel can be viewed with a watering can. Cannon himself rates this piece amongst his greatest works.\n\nThe planned promo video for the song was cancelled due to Liam not turning up for the shoot. Instead, a makeshift video was created using footage from the \"Cigarettes & Alcohol\" and US \"Supersonic\" videos.\n\nIn an interview promoting the compilation album, Stop the Clocks, Noel stated that \"Some Might Say\" is the \"archetypical Oasis song' and 'defines what Oasis is\". This is notable, as the song isn't played live much. Noel added later in the interview that along with \"Some Might Say\", its b-side, \"Acquiesce\", was also the song that defined Oasis.\n\nThe song also appears on Stop the Clocks, as do two of the b-sides. Surpisingly, this means that the \"Some Might Say\" single contains the fourth largest number of tracks to appear on Stop the Clocks of any Oasis release (after Definitely Maybe, Morning Glory and The Masterplan). Therefore, more songs from this single ended up on Stop the Clocks than Don't Believe the Truth (2 songs), Standing on the Shoulder of Giants, Heathen Chemistry (1 song each) and Be Here Now (no songs from this album appear on Stop the Clocks).\n\n\"Some Might Say\" is a playable track in both Guitar Hero World Tour and The European version of Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/_/Some+Might+Say\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released on 14 August 1995 as the second single from their second album (What's the Story) Morning Glory?, reaching #2 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\n\"Roll with It\" received a great deal of attention when Food Records, the label of Britpop rivals Blur, moved the original release date of single \"Country House\" to clash with it, sparking what came to be known as \"The Battle of Britpop\". The British media had already reported an intense rivalry between the two bands and this clash of releases was seen as a battle for the number one spot. The media sensation was spurred on by verbal attacks from the respective camps (in particular Noel and Liam Gallagher, Damon Albarn and Alex James), that extended beyond the music industry to the point where the two bands were regularly mentioned on the evening news. In particular, public imagination was sparked by the contrast between the gritty, working class Oasis and the artsy, middle class Blur. In the end, Blur's \"Country House\" single sold 274,000 copies to Oasis' 216,000 copies of \"Roll with It\". The singles charted at number 1 and number 2 respectively.\n\nIn the week of its release, Damon Albarn was asked what he thought of the song. He dubbed the band as \"Quoasis\" and sang \"Down, down, deeper and down\" in reference of the song's likeness to Status Quo's 1975 hit Down Down . Oasis have often been criticised for 'borrowing' samples from 60s and 70s bands; this was one such song containing 'borrowed' music.\n\nThe song is like several other songs, such as \"Supersonic\", in that it preaches the importance of being yourself.\n\nRecently the song has made it back into Oasis' live set-list, being played on their 2009 stadium tour.\n\nThe melody for this song also appears in part in The Lemonheads' song Purple Parallelogram, which was co-written between Gallagher and Evan Dando.\n\nWhen Oasis played \"Roll with It\" on British chart show Top of the Pops, the Gallagher brothers switched roles with Liam pretending to play guitar and Noel pretending to sing (equipped with Liam's tambourine). It mocked the public's inability to tell them apart and also the institution of miming and lip synching on programmes such as Top of the Pops (it is widely believed that the brothers' dislike of miming led them to do it). The set ended with the band erupting in laughter at the Gallaghers' impressions of each other. A video of the performance can be seen at YouTube.\n\nThe photograph used on this release was taken on the beach at Weston Super Mare. In the background is the Grand Pier which burnt down in July 2008. This has made the original vinyl artwork (particularly the 12\" single) highly collectible.\n\nOasis had been following in the footsteps of The Beatles, who were photographed on the beach wearing Victorian bathing costumes in 1963. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/_/Roll+With+It\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was kept from the top-spot by the record breaking Elton John single \"Candle in the Wind 1997\", re-recorded and released in memory of Diana, Princess of Wales, who had died three weeks before the release of \"Stand By Me\". Despite this, Stand By Me still went Gold in the UK.\n\nNoel Gallagher claims to have written the song whilst suffering from food poisoning when he first moved to London. His mother Peggy would phone him to check on him and repeatedly told him to ensure he was eating properly. This spurred Gallagher to cook himself a proper English Sunday dinner, which resulted in a bout of food poisoning. In a 1997 interview promoting Be Here Now, Noel Gallagher had the following to say: \"It starts, 'Made a meal and threw it up on Sunday'. When I first moved to London my mam kept on ringing up and asking was I eating properly. Yes, Mam. So I tried to cook a Sunday roast and puked up for two days with food poisoning. It was back to Pot Noodles after that.\"\n\nThe title for the song probably comes from the song \"Stand By Me\", which was covered by the Gallaghers' idol John Lennon. In a characteristic example of Noel Gallagher lifting elements from songs of which he is fond, the rousing sequence of chord changes between the repeated chorus lyrics 'Stand By me/Nobody knows the way it's gonna be' bears a remarkable similarity to a similar chord sequence in David Bowie's \"All the Young Dudes\", acknowledged by Gallagher: \"It's a bit like Live Forever, I suppose, with a touch of \"All the Young Dudes\" in the background -- though I made sure I changed the chords.\"\n\nDue to Noel Gallagher's general dislike of Be Here Now, Stand By Me is rarely played live by the band at their concerts, as it is Noel who usually decides the song listings for Oasis' tours. A live version of the song from this tour can be found on the double-CD version of Familiar to Millions.\n\nA well-known acoustic version of Stand By Me was shown on television the night before the release of  as part of Be Here Now a BBC1 documentary, featuring Noel, Liam Gallagher and drummer Alan White sitting by the side of a swimming pool, with Liam on vocals, Noel on acoustic guitar and White holding a tambourine. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/_/Stand+By+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It features on their debut album Definitely Maybe, on the \"Whatever\" single, On the Champagne Supernova single and on their best-of album, Stop the Clocks.\nArguably the first Oasis love song, Noel wrote it about an imaginary teenage love affair. Both of the Gallagher brothers claim that the song should be played more often at concerts, and although it is rarely played, it remains a fan favourite. However, it was included on the set list of the band's recent Dig Out Your Soul Tour. Described by current Oasis guitarist Gem Archer as, \"the one for the fans\", the song is considered by many to be the epitome of Oasis as a brash, flowing song that contains some of Noel's finest penned lyrics as well as Liam's most intense vocal.\nDuring the recording of Definitely Maybe, there was an argument between Noel Gallagher and rhythm guitarist Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs. Gallagher was taken to the pub by bassist Paul \"Guigsy\" McGuigan where he calmed down, had a few drinks, went back to the studios and recorded \"Slide Away\". Gallagher claims he wrote it on a Les Paul guitar that Johnny Marr sent to him, since he had few guitars available to him at the time. On the Definitely Maybe DVD, he also notes that he took Marr's guitar out of the case, sat down, and \"the song wrote itself\".\nPaul McCartney of The Beatles has said that this is his favorite Oasis track.\nIn an interview on the bonus DVD of Stop The Clocks, Noel comments that this track contains Liam's best ever singing. Also in the interview, Noel claimed that he was told to release it as a fifth single from Definitely Maybe, but Gallagher refused because it would be ridiculous to have five singles from a debut album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/_/Slide+Away\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was released as a single only in Japan, peaking at number 48 on the Oricon chart. \nIt was also a success in the United States, where it hit #5 on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart in late 1997. It was the band's last major hit in the United States until 2008's The Shock of The Lightning.\n\nThe song, according to Noel, is about losing someone close and it was written when his mother, Peggy, was hospitalised and suspected of having cancer. His mother did not have cancer, but the experience gave Noel the idea to write something \"quite bleak.\" It has also been claimed that rhythm guitarist Bonehead requested Noel write a song along those lines after the death of his own mother. The line \"Cold and Frosty Morning\" appears to have been lifted from the Kinks' \"Dead End Street\".\n\nLiam Gallagher claims to have cried whilst recording the song, as a result of dwelling on \"a certain thing\". He said, in a 1997 interview, \"I just thought 'fuck that, I can't be singing this song' and I had to go away and sort myself out\". Listening back to the song he admits to being very proud of his vocal performance. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/_/Don%27t+Go+Away\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Noel Gallagher provides lead vocals on both tracks, which he also wrote.\n\n\"Little by Little\" was perhaps the most controversial song on the album, receiving mixed reviews from those who felt it was a classic example of an upbeat Oasis anthem and those who felt it was a twee, patronising, sycophantic melody. Regardless of this, the song managed to peak at number two in the UK charts based largely on the publicity garnered by the song.\n\nThe promo video to the song featured a guest role by Robert Carlyle. The cover art for the single is an homage to Robert Indiana's LOVE artwork. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/_/Little+by+Little\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

This was the last Oasis single to be released on the Creation Records label.\n\n\"All Around the World\", nearly ten minutes long, is embellished with string and horn pieces, and is followed by a two-minute-long instrumental, \"All Around the World (Reprise)\". Upon its release the reviews were generally positive. It is in keeping with many Oasis songs, such as \"Whatever\", \"Acquiesce\", \"Live Forever\" in that it preaches the belief that \"it's gonna be okay\". \nThe song features a backing vocal of \"na-na-na\"'s in the coda similar to the corresponding section in The Beatles ' song \"Hey Jude\".\n\nThe song was one of the first to be written by Noel, and there are recorded sessions of the band rehearsing it at the Boardwalk club as early as 1992. However, despite Noel's fondness for the song, it did not appear on their first two albums, Definitely Maybe and (What's the Story) Morning Glory?, as he wanted to wait until the band could afford to produce the song in the extravagant manner in which it was to eventually appear.

It reached number two in the UK charts, capping a very successful year for the band. \nMany critics cited this song as proof that Oasis had returned to the form seen in the mid-'90s.\n\nA demo for the track was recorded during demo sessions for Standing on the Shoulder of Giants. \nA bootleg of these demo sessions was leaked onto the Internet in early 2000. This track was given the unofficial title \"It's A Crime\" on many bootlegs as the track was unknown and unreferenced anywhere before then. \n\nNote: The song has only been played live two times, the first on an Italian radio show in late 2005 and the second closing a concert in Santiago de Chile, in 2006.

It was a B-Side to the UK #1 single \"Some Might Say\" and appears on the B-side compilation album, The Masterplan, as well.\n\n\"Talk Tonight\" is one of many acoustic B-side tracks sung by Noel, and was at the time, the most vulnerable song he had ever attempted. It was inspired by the near-breakup of the band in Los Angeles in autumn 1994, when Noel walked out without telling anyone and headed for San Francisco. He stayed with a girl he had befriended during a previous show there. According to the sleeve notes to The Masterplan, she talked a distraught Noel \"off the ledge\" and took him to the park where she played as a child. It is also mentioned in the Oasis book by Paul Mathurs, Take Me There, that his friend also had an obsession with Snapple Strawberry Lemonade, which contributed to the line in the song, \"all your dreams are made of strawberry lemonade.\" The song also featured on the DVD \"Live By The Sea\" After Noel makes a mistake on the track \"D'Yer Wanna Be A Spaceman?\".\n\nThe song is included on Oasis' compilation album Stop the Clocks.\n\nPaul Weller played keyboards when Oasis performed this song on Channel 4's The White Room in 1995.\n\nAn extract of the song was used in the 2008 GCSE Music Listening Paper Exam. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/_/Talk+Tonight\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Expect fisher hats, pints in the air and a harmonious eruption of &quot;SENT TO ME FROM HEAVEN, SALLY CINNAMON, YOU&#39;RE MY WORLD!&quot;\n\nPreceding the headline act are the UK&#39;s No.1 Tribute to Oasis, Oaces. Haling from Wigan but with the proper swagger that you&#39;d expect from an Oasis show. If you&#39;re like us and cried when Oasis broke up then make sure not to miss another mega authentic tribute. Playing all the hits and perfecting everything from Liam&#39;s strait jacket stance to the little anecodotes that we all have come to love, you&#39;ll feel like you&#39;re watching the real thing.\n\nHitting the stage just after 4.00pm is a tribute the real pioneers of Hard Rock, AC/BC!  Never before have we heard someone recreate the Ozrockers sound so closely before and just had to get them on the show. Seriously, have you ever heard anyone other than Brian Johnson pull off the &#39;Back in Black&#39; vocals. Expect air guitars galore as their very own Angus shreds his SG in signature schoolboy uniform.\n\nAs usual, Elefest will be hosting some of the finest upcoming bands in the area and has not one, not two, but three absolute belters in store.\n\nFirst up are The JJohn&#39;s. In our opinion this best thing to come out of Liverpool since Stevie G slipped and lost the Premier League Title. With a electric Merseybeat sound and gorgeous harmonies, they are one to watch.\n\nNext up are Sapho. One of St. Helens most popular young acts. Watching these lads develop over the years has been a pleasure. They continuously pack out shows in the area and bring an energetic set of Indie Anthems.\n\nOn stage at around 3pm will be Messiahs. Already gaining airplay on US and UK radio these lads display a songsmanship and attitude that hasn&#39;t been seen since the heyday of 90&#39;s Britpop.\n\n\n\nClearly, we&#39;re treating you a little bit too much but wait, there&#39;s more...\n\nTime to forget the beach bod! Hailing from the snowy peaks of North Wales, we have delicious gourmet burgers and fries oozing in Bacon, Cheese and BEEFY BEEFINESS. Streetcafe will be pitching up right near the entrance all day long. That&#39;s Breakfast, lunch and tea sorted.\n\nFor drinks we have indoor and outdoor bars serving everything you could possibly want. Cocktails include Fosters and Lemonade. Beers and Ciders from \u00a32.50.\n\n\n\nSaturday 7th July. Gates open at 12pm with music finishing around 8.30pm.\n\nThe Elephant Hotel, Elephant Hotel, WA9 5QW\n\n\n\nWe have just 300 tickets available.

Originally known as The Rain, the group was formed by Liam Gallagher (vocals and tambourine), Paul Arthurs (guitar), Paul McGuigan (bass guitar) and Tony McCarroll (drums, percussion), who were soon joined by Liam's older brother Noel Gallagher (lead guitar and vocals).\n\nIts members were signed to independent record label Creation Records and released their record-setting debut album Definitely Maybe in 1994, including hits like Live Forever and Supersonic.\n\nThe following year, the band recorded the critically acclaimed (What's the Story) Morning Glory? with their new drummer Alan White that led to international success propelled by singles Wonderwall, Don't Look Back in Anger and Champagne Supernova. In 1997, Oasis released third album and became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history, aside Michael Jackson's Bad. McGuigan and Arthurs left the band as they went on to record and release Standing on the Shoulder of Giants and were replaced by Gem Archer and Andy Bell who joined the group for the recording of Heathen Chemistry.\n\nIn August 2009, Noel Gallagher announced his departure from the band. Liam Gallagher initially stated that Oasis were \"done\", but later in February 2010 announced that the remaining members of the band would continue to record music, and did not rule out the possibility of retaining the Oasis name. However, Liam and other former members of the band are instead continuing under the name Beady Eye and Noel has formed Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Oasis\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band currently resides in Cambridge.\n\nUnger-Hamilton studied English Literature; the other three Fine Art. In their second year of studies, Newman showed Sainsbury a handful of his own songs inspired by his guitar-playing dad and hallucinogens, and the pair began recording in their dorm rooms with Sainsbury acting as producer on Garageband. \n\nFirst as Daljit Dhaliwal and then as Films, they spent the next two years playing around town. Their eponymous first 4-track demo \u2206, was recorded with producer Charlie Andrew in London and included early versions of \"Breezeblocks\", \"Hand-Made\", \"Matilda\" and \"Tessellate\".\n\nTheir first 2012 release for Infectious was the triangle shaped 7\" \"Matilda\" / \"Fitzpleasure\", followed by \"Breezeblocks\" as an advance of their first album An Awesome Wave, released on 25 May 2012. That same year, they won the prestigious Barclaycard Mercury Prize for An Awesome Wave.\n\nOn January 2014, Sainsbury announced that he had left the band. \"Hunger of the Pine\" was released in June, with an accompanying video. Their second record, This is All Yours was released in September 2014.\n\nhttp://altjband.com   <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/alt-J\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

My favorite song... just beautiful!! \"Your Song\" by Elton Jonh *DISCLAIMER* Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright..."}, "description": "\"Your Song\" is a ballad composed and performed by musician Elton John. The song's lyrics were written by Bernie Taupin. According to the Your Song Songfacts, he wrote them over breakfast at John's parents' house, where he was living. The original lyrics have coffee stains on them. It appeared on John's self-titled second album in 1970.\n\nThe song was released in the U.S. in October 1970 as the B-side to \"Take Me to the Pilot\". Both received airplay, but \"Your Song\" was preferred by disc jockeys and replaced \"Take Me to the Pilot\" as the A-side, eventually making both the UK and U.S. top ten charts.\n\nComposition and inspiration\n\n\"Your Song\" is a soft blend of two different styles: folk and jazz: \"I hope you don't mind / I hope you don't mind / That I put down in words / How wonderful life is while you're in the world.\" The instrumental focus is on John's Leon Russell-influenced piano work, along with acoustic guitar, Paul Buckmaster's string accompaniment, and a shuffling rhythm section.\n\nThe lyrics express the romantic thoughts of an innocent. Taupin offers a straightforward love-song lyric at the beginning: \"It's a little bit funny this feeling inside / I'm not one of those who can easily hide / I don't have much money but boy if I did / I'd buy a big house where we both could live.\" At times the self-deprecating narrator stumbles to get out his feelings, which despite being a melodramatic device, Allmusic calls \"effective and sweet\": \"So excuse me forgetting but these things I do / You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue / Anyway the thing is what I really mean / Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen / And you can tell everybody this is your song / It may be quite simple but now that it's done.\"\n\nThe song was part of a stockpile of songs John and Taupin wrote in 1969 while living together. John pinpoints his composition of the music to October 27. Supposedly, it took him only ten minutes. Taupin had penned the lyrics earlier that day over breakfast. John cites the song as one of his favourites, and plays it at many of his concerts. In an interview, he commented that \"[he doesn't] think [he has] written a love song as good since\".\n\n\"Your Song\" was itself the inspiration for the song \"We All Fall in Love Sometimes\" on John's 1975 album Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy.\n\nReception\n\n\"Your Song\" was praised by critics upon release and in subsequent years. Allmusic has stated that it \"is a near-perfect song\". John Lennon (formerly of The Beatles) stated the song is \"the first new thing that's happened since we happened.\" Rolling Stone called the song a \"pretty McCartneyesque ballad\". In 2004 Rolling Stone included the song in their 2004 list of 500 Greatest Songs of All Time at #136.\n\nChart performance and impact\n\nThe song was John's first pop hit.

The song was written by Bernie Taupin and composed by John for his album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. Its musical style and production is heavily influenced by 1970s soft rock. It was widely praised by critics, and some critics have named it John's best song.\n\nThe song was released in 1973 as the album's second single, and entered the Top Ten in both the United Kingdom and the United States. It was one of John's biggest hits, and surpassed the previous single in sales and popularity quickly following its release. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Elton+John/_/Goodbye+Yellow+Brick+Road\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was originally written in 1973, in honor of Marilyn Monroe, who had died 11 years earlier.\n\nIn 1997, John performed a remake of the song as a tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales. This version of the song was released as a single, and reached No. 1 in many countries, proving a much greater success than the original.\n\nThe original version in the key of E major appeared on John's 1973 album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. The lyrics of the song are a sympathetic portrayal of the life of Marilyn Monroe (the song's opening line \"Goodbye Norma Jean\" refers to Monroe's real name). The single release of the original song reached #11 in the U.K. charts in 1974. At the time, it was not released as a single in the United States (\"Bennie and the Jets\" was chosen instead). Taupin was inspired to write the song after hearing the phrase \"candle in the wind\" used in tribute to Janis Joplin.\n\nIn 1987, a live version of the song recorded for the album Live in Australia with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra was released as a single. This version was released in the United States and reached #6 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also reached #5 in the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Candle in the Wind 1997\" or \"Goodbye England's Rose\" is a remake of \"Candle in the Wind\" as a tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales. The opening lines of the 1973 version, \"Goodbye Norma Jean, though I never knew you at all,\" were adapted to \"Goodbye England's rose, may you ever grow in our hearts.\" In fact, most of the lyrics were adapted to suit the circumstances of Diana's life and death: one notable omission was the line \"Even when you died, the Press still hounded you\".\n\nReleased in 1997, the song peaked at No. 1 in the United Kingdom, becoming John's fourth No. 1 single. It also peaked at No. 1 in several other countries. The Guinness Book of Records 2007 states that \"Candle In the Wind 1997\" is the biggest-selling single \"since records began,\" but that Bing Crosby's \"White Christmas\" has sold the most copies. John said he would never again sing this version live except at the request of Harry or William Windsor. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Elton+John/_/Candle+in+the+Wind\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is loosely based on the short story \"The Rocket Man\" in Ray Bradbury's book The Illustrated Man, and echoes the theme of David Bowie's 1969 song \"Space Oddity\" (both recordings were produced by Gus Dudgeon). The song first appeared on John's 1972 album Honky Ch\u00e2teau and became a hit single, rising to #2 in the UK and #6 in the U.S.\n\nThe lyrics in the song, written by John's longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin, describe a Mars-bound astronaut's mixed feelings at leaving his family in order to do his job. Musically, the song is a highly arranged pop ballad anchored by John's piano, with atmospheric texture added by synthesizer and processed slide guitar.\n\n\"Rocket Man\" was ranked #242 in the 2004 List of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nAnother song called \"Rocket Man\" (and also based on Bradbury's short story) was released by the musical group Pearls Before Swine on their 1970 album The Use of Ashes. In an interview in Billboard magazine, Taupin acknowledged that the song, written by Tom Rapp, had been a direct inspiration for his own lyrics.\n\nElton John performed \"Rocket Man\" at the launch site of Space Shuttle Discovery in 1998. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Elton+John/_/Rocket+Man+(I+Think+It%27s+Going+to+Be+a+Long+Long+Time)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was written by John and his collaborator Bernie Taupin, and produced by Gus Dudgeon. It was written in the key of C major.\n\nIn the song, Elton sings to someone he has helped and from whom he is now experiencing rejection. It was written with the other songs on the album during a ten day period in January 1974.\n\nThe chorus of the song is supported with a horn arrangement by Del Newman, and features backing vocals of the Beach Boys' Carl Wilson and Bruce Johnston, and Toni Tennille. Also on the song are percussion accents provided by Ray Cooper and a mellotron played by Dave Hentschel.\n\nAs successful as the 1974 record had been, it was as a duet with George Michael that \"Don't Let The Sun Go Down on Me\" had its greatest success. The pair had performed the song at the Live Aid concert in 1985. Recorded live at a concert at Wembley Arena, London on March 25, 1991 when Elton John was a surprise guest of George Michael, the duet became a massive hit on both sides of the Atlantic. It was released later that year and reached number one on the UK singles chart for two weeks in December 1991 and a single week on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1992.\n\nThe footage used for the music video of the song was taken from a \"live\" concert in Chicago with 70,000 fans. \"The video was actually shot over several days,\" confirms Michael Pagnotta, George's publicist. \"It was shot in an airline hangar in Burbank where George had been rehearsing; Elton came in for a night and they ran through the song a couple of times. Then the song was filmed in its entirety live in Chicago in the middle of October as part of that Cover to Cover tour, and when Elton came out from the wings, that place went crazy.\" It appears on John's Love Songs compilation. The proceeds from the single were divided among 10 different charities for children, AIDS and education.\n\nBoth John and Michael would perform at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert a year after the single's release.\n\n\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\" charted on June 1, 1974 in Great Britain, making it to number 16. In the United States, it was released while \"Bennie and the Jets\" was still in the Top 40, and reached the Top 10 after four weeks. On August 10, the song's two week stay at number 2 ended. It could not oust John Denver's \"Annie's Song,\" Roberta Flack's \"Feel Like Makin' Love\" nor Paper Lace's \"The Night Chicago Died\" from the top spot. But a number 2 pinnacle guaranteed it further airplay. By September it would become Elton's fourth gold single.\n\n\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\" has been a popular song for other artists to perform or record as well. Jay Chattaway arranged this song into a jazz version, which Maynard Ferguson first performed in the 1970s show \"The Mark of Jazz\" with host Sid Mark. This live version stems from around 1975; it was never recorded onto an album.\n\nJoe Cocker recorded his version of the song on \"The Best of Joe Cocker\".\n\nRoger Daltrey (who would also appear at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert) sang it for the 1987 soundtrack The Lost Boys.\n\nAfrican-American Gospel group The Winans released a version of the song on their album Decisions in 1987 \n\nGloria Estefan recorded it in 1989.\n\nJazz singer Oleta Adams recorded it on the 1991 tribute album Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John & Bernie Taupin. Late 1990s punk cover specialty act Me First and the Gimme Gimmes also took it on. In December 2002 David Sneddon won the BBC's first Fame Academy show singing his version of \"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\" and his own song \"Stop Living The Lie\". Sneddon also put his version of Elton's song on the B side, which was number one in the UK Singles Chart in January 2003.\n\nIn 2003, Vanessa Carlton performed the song during the Elton John Tribute Concert. Also in the 2000s, \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\" has become a frequent selection of reality television singing contestants. Most notably, Clay Aiken's performance of it in the semi-final wild-card round of the second season of American Idol propelled him into the finals and later a very successful recording career. \"Don't Let\" became one of Aiken's signature performances, and was reprised in the fifth season in a surprise appearance involving Michael Sandecki. David Archuleta's performance of it during the American Idol Season 7 Final received a lot of praise from all the Judges and even prompted Simon to proclaim it to be Archuleta's best performance on the show. Other such contestants who have performed it include American Idol's Justin Guarini, Jasmine Trias, Bo Bice, Jorge Nu\u00f1ez, Canadian Idol's Tyler Hamilton, Australian Idol's Nathan Brake, New Zealand Idol's Clinton Randell, and The X Factor's Journey South and Joe McElderry, who received a standing ovation from all the judges, which was the first time in the series. Lately, it has become popular on Spanish show \"Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo\", sung by Moritz. Forest Whitaker sang \"Don't Let\" in a comedy skit when he hosted the television show Saturday Night Live on February 10, 2007.\n\nThe song is covered by the company Wavegroup for the music video game Karaoke Revolution Presents:American Idol. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Elton+John/_/Don%27t+Let+the+Sun+Go+Down+on+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was written by Elton John without Bernie Taupin under the pseudonym \"Ann Orson\" and \"Carte Blanche\" (a pun on the expression \"an horse and cart, blanche\"), and intended as an affectionate pastiche of the Tamla Motown style, notably the various duets recorded by Marvin Gaye and singers such as Tammi Terrell and Kim Weston. It is not to be confused with the Burt Bacharach/Hal David song of the same title recorded in 1966 by Dionne Warwick.\n\nLike many of Elton John's singles from the 1970s, it was never included on any of his original albums (though it was recorded during the same sessions that produced Blue Moves). However, it was included on the original version of Elton John's Greatest Hits Volume II in 1977. It has since been shifted to the \"Volume 3\" compilation, Greatest Hits 1976\u20131986. In 2002, it also appeared on Elton John's 2-disc greatest hits album, Elton John's Greatest Hits 1970-2002. A demo version of the song was recorded by John as a solo artist. This version has not been released commercially. The song was also covered by Ol' Dirty Bastard with Macy Gray, and by Anne Hathaway and Jesse McCartney for the 2004 film Ella Enchanted and its soundtrack.\n\n\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" was also John's first No. 1 single in the UK, topping the chart for six weeks in mid 1976. He would not enjoy a solo British chart-topper until 1990. It also became his sixth No. 1 single in the US, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks.\n\nThe b-side \"Snow Queen\" has yet to be released on CD.[citation needed] The song was supposedly inspired by Cher, with Elton's improvising past Sonny & Cher hits I Got You Babe, and The Beat Goes On as well as the solo Cher song Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down) during the fadeout of the song.\n\nIn 1985, John and Dee performed the track to the crowd at Wembley Stadium during John's set at Live Aid (where Dee sang backup). In 1987, Elton appeared with Minnie Mouse on the NBC series Totally Minnie performing the track. Almost 20 years after the initial release, John re-recorded the song with RuPaul and re-issued it. He also performed it with the Spice Girls on his ITV tribute programme An Audience With Elton John.\n\nThe song\u2019s promotional film has been cited among the cheapest music videos ever produced[citation needed]. The circumstances behind its conception were detailed on an episode of Pop-Up Video. The video\u2019s director was found in the midst of filming a Rod Stewart television special. He was pulled aside, located an unused soundstage, hastily dressed it to give the appearance of a recording studio, setup three cameras and had the two singers pretend to record their vocals. Shot in a single take while being told to \u2018improvise\u2019, Elton John and Kiki Dee often missed their cues and John\u2019s attempt to lead Dee in a very haphazard dance sequence caught his companion off guard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Elton+John/_/Don%27t+Go+Breaking+My+Heart\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It concludes side one in the album's telling of the history of John's and lyricist Bernie Taupin's struggles to find careers within the music industry. When released as the album's only single in 1975, it reached #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and entered the top 25 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nTaupin's lyric refers to a time in 1969, before John was a popular musician, when John was considering marriage to his girlfriend, Linda Woodrow. John and Woodrow were sharing a flat with Taupin on Furlong Road in the East End of London, hence the opening line. While having serious doubts about the looming marriage, John contemplated suicide. He took refuge in his friends, especially Long John Baldry, who convinced John to abandon his plans to marry in order to salvage and maintain his musical career. As a sign of his respect and gratitude for Baldry, Taupin wrote him into the song as the \"someone\" in the title and as the \"Sugar Bear\" mentioned in the lyrics. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Elton+John/_/Someone+Saved+My+Life+Tonight\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The account goes on to relate that the notion of astronauts no longer being perceived as heroes, but in fact as an \"everyday occupation\" led him to the song's opening lines, \"She packed my bags last night, pre-flight.

In a career spanning five decades, Elton John has sold over 250 million records and has over fifty Top 40 hits, making him one of the most successful musicians of all time. His 1997 tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales, \" Candle In The Wind 1997,\" remains the world's biggest selling and fastest selling single of all time.\n\nIn 1964, Dwight and his friends formed a band called Bluesology. By day, he ran errands for a music publishing company; he divided his nights between solo gigs at a London hotel bar and working with Bluesology. By the mid-1960s, Bluesology was backing touring American soul and R&B musicians like The Isley Brothers, Major Lance, Billy Stewart, Doris Troy and Patti LaBelle and The Bluebelles. In 1966, the band became musician Long John Baldry's supporting band and played 16 times at The Marquee Club.\n\nJohn was one of the dominant commercial forces in the rock world during the 1970s, with a string of seven consecutive #1 records on the U.S. album charts, twenty-three Top 40 singles, sixty Top 10 hits, and six #1 hits. His success had a profound impact on popular music, and contributed to the continued popularity of the piano in rock and roll. \n\nKey musical elements in John's success included his melodic gifts matched with the contributions of his lyricist partner Bernie Taupin, his rich tenor and gospel-chorded piano, aggressive string arrangements, his flamboyant fashion sense and on-stage showmanship. As told by himself, his somewhat \"flashy\" outfits were due to the fact that he sits behind the piano and would otherwise vanish on stage.\n\nJohn was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and knighted in 1998.  He has helped lead the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s.  In 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked John #49 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

Usually it was Shayne who wrote the lyrics for their songs while Regney composed the music, as they did when they wrote a song based on the classic children's song \"Rain Rain Go Away\".\n\nRegney was inspired to write the lyrics \"Said the night wind to the little lamb, 'Do you see what I see?'\" and \"Pray for peace, people everywhere\", after watching babies being pushed in strollers on the sidewalks of New York City.Shayne stated in an interview years later that neither could personally perform the entire song at the time they wrote it because of the emotions surrounding the Cuban Missile Crisis. \"Our little song broke us up. You must realize there was a threat of nuclear war at the time.\"\n\nBing Crosby made the song into a hit when he recorded his own version of it on October 21, 1963, with the record being released as a single on October 26. Crosby also performed the song on a Bob Hope Christmas television special on December 13 of that year. Over the years, Crosby's recording of the song has been widely played on the radio, and has been available on numerous compilation Christmas albums and compact discs put out by Capitol Records. It is perhaps the most often-heard version of the song.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bing+Crosby/_/Do+You+Hear+What+I+Hear%3F+-+2006+-+Remaster\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Usually it was Shayne who wrote the lyrics for their songs while Regney composed the music, as they did when they wrote a song based on the classic children's song \"Rain Rain Go Away\".\n\nRegney was inspired to write the lyrics \"Said the night wind to the little lamb, 'Do you see what I see?'\" and \"Pray for peace, people everywhere\", after watching babies being pushed in strollers on the sidewalks of New York City.Shayne stated in an interview years later that neither could personally perform the entire song at the time they wrote it because of the emotions surrounding the Cuban Missile Crisis. \"Our little song broke us up. You must realize there was a threat of nuclear war at the time.\"\n\nBing Crosby made the song into a hit when he recorded his own version of it on October 21, 1963, with the record being released as a single on October 26. Crosby also performed the song on a Bob Hope Christmas television special on December 13 of that year. Over the years, Crosby's recording of the song has been widely played on the radio, and has been available on numerous compilation Christmas albums and compact discs put out by Capitol Records. It is perhaps the most often-heard version of the song.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bing+Crosby/_/Do+You+Hear+What+I+Hear%3F\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Widely recognized as one of the most popular musical acts in history, Crosby is also credited as being the major inspiration for most of the male singers of the era that followed him, including Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, and Dean Martin. In 1962, Crosby was the first person to be recognized with the Grammy Global Achievement Award and is one of the few people to have three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Father Chuck O'Malley in the 1944 motion picture Going My Way.\n\nBing Crosby's influence on popular culture and popular music is considerable, as from 1934 to 1954 he held a nearly unrivaled command of record sales, radio ratings and motion picture grosses. He is usually considered to be a member of popular music's \"holy trinity\" of ultra-icons, alongside Elvis Presley and The Beatles.\n\nBing Crosby popularized singing with conversational ease, or 'crooning'. His musical interpretations amalgamated rhythm and romance with scat singing, whistling, rhythmic improvisation and melodic paraphrasing as elements of a hotter, sexier sound than had been conceived before.\n\nIn 1926, while singing at Los Angeles Metropolitan Theater, Crosby and his vocal duo partner Al Rinker caught the eye of Paul Whiteman, arguably the most famous bandleader at the time. Hired for $150 a week, they made their debut on December 6, 1926 at the Tivoli Theatre (Chicago). Their first recording, \"I've Got The Girl,\" with Don Clark's Orchestra, was issued by Columbia and did them no vocal favors as it sounded as if they were singing in a key much too high for them. It was later revealed that the 78 rpm was recorded at a speed slower than it should have been, which increased the pitch when played at 78 rpm.\n\nCrosby is also credited as being the major inspiration for most of the male singers that followed him, including the likes of Frank Sinatra, Perry Como and Dean Martin. Tony Bennett summed up Crosby's impact, stating, \"Bing created a culture. He contributed more to popular music than any other person - he moulded popular music. Every singer in the business has taken something from Crosby. Every male singer has a Bing Crosby idiosyncracy.\"\n\nCrosby's recording of  White Christmas is recognized as the best-selling single in any music category with over 40 million copies sold. \n\nIn 1962, Crosby was the first person to receive the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bing+Crosby\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

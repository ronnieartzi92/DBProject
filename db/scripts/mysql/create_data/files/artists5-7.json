wonder why, why my heart still yearns\nAnd I wonder why, why the earth still turns\nAnd I wonder why, why the sky turns black\nStill I wonder why, but there is no turning back\n\nFor all eternity, for all the world to see\nWe're riding high across the wind\nAnd when the storm begins, to wash away all sins\nWe'll find a place where we'll begin\n\nThere's something wrong with the world today,\nOnly the people that are fighting for...\n...A better place in the world today,\nThey don't believe that they gone too far,\n...They're falling down.\n\nBy moonlight there's way...for rebellion\nHere, the world are gone astray...revolution\nNow, the time has come to pray...halleluja\nDeep, inside our minds we wait...for rebellion -\nHere in dreamland we will not obey the masters\n\n...And the earth still turns but I'm on my way,\nHe is on the way, as my heart still yearns\n...I'm on my way, now he is on the way,\nAnd I cry for more\nYes I'm on my way, now he's on the way,\nGonna find the secret wall\n\nI have seen the secret dreams\nOf those who know eternity\nAnd makes me feel like a shadow sneaking in\nIn my sleep I'm searching for a way to find\nThe open do leading me to where it all begins\nThere's nothing wrong with the world today...\n\nThere's something wrong with the world today,\nOnly the people that are fighting for...\n...A better place in the world today,\nThey don't believe that they gone too far,\n...They're falling down.\n\nBy moonlight there's way...for rebellion\nHere, the world are gone astray...revolution\nNow, the time has come to pray...halleluja\nDeep, inside our minds we wait...for rebellion -\nHere in dreamland we will not obey the masters\n\n[SOLO: Kai]\n\nNow I'm riding through the air\nGoing to where no one dares\nOn the way I cross the line forevermore.\nFor once in life, I do not care\nNothing matters, now I dare\nOn the ride I'll cross the line\nForever to be free\n\n[SOLO: Dirk]\n\nI have no fear, Rebellion is here!", "youtube":

The\u00a0Instructor will be Dr. Ali Jaffri of Applied Stratigraphix. The Course Being able to interpret environments of deposition using open-hole logs is a skill most geologists and engineers desire. As important as this skill is, not many publications and industry courses address this issue. The purpose of this course is to use a systematic approach that uses the process of elimination to diagnose common fluvial and shallow marine depositional environments in well log suites such as Gamma Ray, Resistivity and Porosity and in Borehole Image and Dipmeter Logs. Borehole image logs are commonly acquired but are often under-utilized when it comes to interpreting environments of deposition. Most geoscientists and engineers are somewhat familiar with picking faults and fractures on image logs, but the same professionals will often rely on reports provided by the logging company for sedimentology and stratigraphy. This 2-day course is taught in a workshop format and after a morning lecture session, afternoons are devoted to interpretation of logs provided by the instructor. Participants are also encouraged to bring their own logs to work on (these data will not be shared with other participants and will only be reviewed by the instructor). The Instructor Dr. Ali Jaffri is the founder of Applied Stratigraphix LLC, has a doctorate in geology, and specializes in sequence stratigraphy. Between consulting projects, full-time positions and internships he has worked on the Williston Basin, the North Sea, Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea, West Africa, Southern Indus Basin, the Pricaspian Basin of Kazakhstan and others. His doctorate at Colorado State University focused on sequence stratigraphy of mixed carbonate-siliciclastic-evaporite systems of the Williston Basin in the U.S., and modern coastlines in the Persian Gulf. The doctoral work was supplemented with projects with ExxonMobil Research Labs, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Delta Petroleum, and Brigham Oil and Gas. Masters Degree was acquired from a well-known petroleum school in the U.S. (Oklahoma State University), and the thesis focused on mechanical stratigraphy of a fractured carbonate reservoir. Bachelors from the University of Colorado at Boulder involved detailed fieldwork on fluvial stratigraphy.

Teachers Eating Pizza is an educator workshop at the Fleet Science Center that occurs on the first Wednesday of each month.\u00a0\u00a0 Come for the pizza, converse with colleagues, learn curriculum-ready interdisciplinary content related to the month&#39;s topic and attend the 7 p.m. The Sky Tonight Astronomer-led planetarium show in the Heikoff Giant Dome Theater. Following the workshop, the San Diego Astronomy Association invites you to view the stars through telescopes on the Prado during their monthly program Stars in the Park.\u00a0 The following topics are emphasized in the workshop and planetarium. The topic of the educator workshop may vary from the planetarium show to be more in line with Next Generation Science Standards. January 3, 2018: Deep Space Observations and Properties of Light Waves In the Workshop: Wave Properties and the Hubble Space Telescope. How does Hubble see and how has Hubble&#39;s vision given us an increased understanding of our universe? Explore deep space objects through properties of light waves in this month&#39;s workshop. In the Planetarium:\u00a0NASA\u2019s Great Observatories.\u00a0To the naked eye, the night sky is collection of stars and planets scattered across a deep black canvas, but the sky looks very different using telescopes to observe the universe on wavelengths our eyes can\u2019t see. The Hubble Telescope and other space-borne observatories in NASA\u2019s Great Observatories program were designed to show us the universe in gamma rays, X-rays, optical and infrared wavelengths. Join us this month to learn more about the Great Observatories and the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope. February 7, 2018: Micro Rocket Lab and Black Holes In the Workshop:\u00a0Micro Rockets. Hydrogen and oxygen in the right ratio will cause an explosive reaction, enough to power rockets like that found on the Space Shuttle. In this lab, participants will experiment with ratios, gather data and communicate findings for optimal rocket design.\u00a0 In the Planetarium:\u00a0White Dwarfs, Neutron Stars, and Black Holes.\u00a0When stars die, they leave behind white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. How can a star be made out of neutrons? Black holes are often thought to be cosmic vacuum cleaners, but do they really suck up everything around them? This month\u2019s shows focuses on these exotic stellar remnants. March 7, 2018:\u00a0 In the Workshop:\u00a0TBD In the Planetarium:\u00a0TBD What does this event include? Pizza!

He soon found Daniel Johansson, a young but experienced and very talented guitar player who wielded a traditional metal guitar style. The two started working on some of Harry&#39;s earlier material and began to write new songs. After a long and tiresome search, Harry then found Oscar Carlquist; a powerful heavy metal vocalist with a mutual hatred for the current metal scene. Oscar quickly became involved in the song-writing process and crafted interesting lyrics to accompany the music. The backbone of RAM was formed. Oscar brought in drummer Morgan Pettersson, one of the few drummers left who still played the 70/80&#39;s hard and heavy drumming style. They then recruited the legendary Leif Larsson, an icon in Gothenburg metal as he had previously been a member of Frozen Eyes.<p>The five members started to rehearse and write new songs, and in 2003 they released their first EP, Sudden Impact, through partly their own label &quot;Black Path Metal Recordings&quot;. The EP created an immediate impact on the underground metal scene; the first 1000 copies were sold out in a few months. RAM hit the road and played a number of festivals in Europe and went on tour as support for Sebastian Bach. The band was also recognized by Germany&#39;s Rock Hard magazine as one of the best newcomers of 2004.<p>RAM kept on playing live throughout most of &#39;05 and started working on their full-length debut album Forced Entry, which was released in late 2005. Forced Entry brought the entire old school heavy metal community to its knees. The album is a pure sonic attack of real and innovative heavy metal. Great reviews followed and the band grew even bigger. In December &#39;05, RAM hit the road with Dark Tranquillity, and in Jan &#39;06 they performed at several Scandinavian shows with Gamma Ray.<p>Playing live is what RAM does best and in 2006-2007, the band delivered a devastating metal crusade over Europe. Reaching places such as Greece for the first time and Spain for the second time, the Teutonic hordes went wild. In the summer of 2007, bass player Leif Larsson was asked to leave the band due to personal differences and Tyrant of the Black Metal ultra cult act Nifelheim answered the call and joined RAM as a session bass player.<p>In 2008, the band returned to the studio with producer Johan Reiv\u00e9n to record the album Lightbringer. This time they really took the time to explore the true heavy metal sound. The recording of the album took 10 months of nothing but strife for pure heavy metal perfection.<p>In 2009, RAM signed a deal with AFM records and released Lightbringer, which received very good reviews. It landed a spot as one of the best albums of 2009 in Sweden Rock magazine. The band also headed out on headline European tour to promote the album. Tobbe Petterson joined the band and through his amazing bass skills made this the<p>strongest RAM lineup ever.<p>In 2010, RAM began recording their 3rd full-length album entitled Death. The album was produced by Per St\u00e5lberg and Olle Bj\u00f6rk. In 2011, they signed a worldwide deal with renowned label Metal Blade Records and Death was released in January 2012. RAM hit the road in support of Death returning to Spain, visiting Portugal for the first time, plus Germany and Sweden. In June 2013, Daniel Johansson decided to quit the band due to personal reasons. Daniel was quickly replaced by guitarist Martin Jonsson from Gothenburg who brought a new dimension to the band with a deadly shredding guitar style. On September 13th, 2013, RAM celebrated the 10th anniversary of the release of the Sudden Impact EP with a special concert in Gothenburg, the first decade of Heavy Metal Tyranny was complete!<p>RAM continued to destroy stages through the spring of 2015 all over Europe, then they once again entered the studio to record their fourth album. Svbversvm was another step upon the Black Path that is RAM&#39;s career and showcased yet another dimension of RAM&#39;s song-writing and muscianship. Svbversvm recieved amazing reviews and caputered the number one spot in Deaf Forever Magazine soundcheck. Svbversvm appeared on many best album of 2015 lists in the rock press. RAM supported the release with another tour and several festival appearances.<p>In the spring of 2017, RAM entered the studio once again to record their 5th full-length studio album Rod. This album is the first RAM album to feature a concept story consisting of 6 songs that account for the entire B side of the LP. Once again the reviews were through the roof. ROD also came in at number on in the Deaf Forever soundcheck! RAM were also featured on the cover of the October issue of Deaf Forever Magazine. ROD entered the German album charts at #64.<p>In 2018 RAM plan to tour extensively in support of ROD. So expect some devastating attacks of Heavy Metal Tyranny!<p>https://open.spotify.com/artist/0dczfxuYhV69pplxDxzlwu https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juR0WfvA6xc</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>", "img": null, "title": "RAM & PORTRAIT - ROAD KILL TOUR 2018 (Double Headliner Tour)", "url": "http://munich.eventful.com/events/ram-portrait-road-kill-tour-2018-double-headli-/E0-001-109213765-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "Germany", "venue": "Backstage", "city": "Munich"}, {"date": "2018-01-21 14:30:00", "description": " <p> Running time: 3hr 55 mins. Doors 2.30pm, screening beginning 3pm.<p> After awakening from a dream of Gandalf the Grey battling the Balrog, Frodo Baggins and his friend Samwise Gamgee continue their journey to Mordor to destroy the One Ring by throwing it into Mount Doom. They are attacked in the night by Gollum, former owner of the Ring, but they capture him. Sympathising with Gollum, for what he perceives as their shared burden, Frodo asks Gollum to lead them safely to Mordor, despite Sam\u2019s objections. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli pursue the Uruk-hai, who kidnapped their friends Merry and Pippin. The Uruk-hai are slaughtered by the Rohirrim, army of Rohan, but the two Hobbits escape into Fangorn Forest, where they meet the Ent Treebeard. Aragorn\u2019s group later meet the Rohirrim, who have been banished by their king Th\u00e9oden, who is being manipulated by Saruman\u2019s servant Grima Wormtongue. Tracking down the Hobbits in Fangorn, Aragorn\u2019s group encounter a resurrected Gandalf, who perished in Moria, but was revived to help save Middle-earth.<p> Gollum leads Frodo and Sam through the Dead Marshes while evading the Nazg\u00fbl. They reach the Black Gate to Mordor, but Gollum stops them, stating that it&#39;s too risky, and that there is another entrance, finding himself becoming loyal to Frodo for his kindness. The trio later are captured by the Rangers of Ithilien, led by Faramir, brother of the late Boromir. When Faramir discovers that Frodo has the Ring, he intends on taking him to Gondor, capturing Gollum when Frodo exposes him. Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, and Gimli travel to Rohan\u2019s capital of Edoras, where Gandalf releases Th\u00e9oden from Saruman\u2019s power, and Wormtongue is banished. Learning about Saruman plans on wiping out Rohan with an army of Uruk-hai, Th\u00e9oden decides to move his citizens to the protection of Helm&#39;s Deep, but Gandalf departs to discover that the Rohirrim are led by Th\u00e9oden&#39;s nephew, \u00c9omer. Aragorn builds a friendship with Th\u00e9oden\u2019s niece, \u00c9owyn, who quickly becomes infatuated with him. During a Warg attack, Aragorn falls off a cliff into a river, but is found by his horse, and taken to Helm\u2019s Deep.<p> In Fangorn, Merry and Pippin attend an Ent council, where they learn that Treebeard and the others will not participate in the war. They convince them otherwise after showing them the destruction Saruman has unleashed on the forests around Isengard. The Ents storm Isengard, and release the dam placed upon the nearby river, which gushes into Isengard, drowning the Uruk-hai, quenching the fires of its industry, and stranding Saruman in his tower. The Uruk-hai army arrive at Helm\u2019s Deep, finding a makeshift army of civilians and Elves from Lothlorien waiting for them. A battle follows with Th\u00e9oden, losing hope until Aragorn convinces him to ride out and meet them. Gandalf and the Rohirrim arrive, turning the tide of the battle and destroying the Uruk-hai.<p> Frodo, Sam, and Gollum are taken to the fallen Gondor city of Osgiliath, but are attacked by the Nazg\u00fbl and Mordor army. Sam informs Faramir of how the Ring nearly drove Boromir insane, stunning Faramir. Frodo is nearly captured by the Nazg\u00fbl, but Sam tackles him down a flight of stairs, saving him. After the attack ends, Faramir frees the trio, and sends them on their way. Gollum, hurt by Frodo\u2019s seeming betrayal, decides to reclaim the Ring by leading Frodo and Sam to a creature he refers to as \u201cHer\u201d, leading them away towards Mordor.<p> Screening suitable for all ages, including children 10+ with the accompaniment of an adult.

Door open 2.30, screening beginning 3pm.<p> Many years ago, two Hobbits, Smeagol and D\u00e9agol, are playfully fishing when D\u00e9agol discovers the One Ring beneath the river. The two quickly begin to fight over the ring, and Smeagol kills his friend. Retreating into the mountains, Smeagol gradually becomes an animalistic creature called Gollum, forgetting his old identity and becoming obsessed with the ring.<p> Gandalf leads Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and King Th\u00e9oden to Isengard where they reunite with Merry and Pippin. With Saruman defeated, Gandalf retrieves Saruman&#39;s palant\u00edr. Pippin later steals a glance into the seeing-stone, and suffers a mental attack from Sauron himself. Gandalf deduces that Sauron will attack Gondor&#39;s capital Minas Tirith. He rides there to warn them, taking Pippin with him because Sauron believes Pippin is the ring bearer.<p> Meanwhile, Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee are led by Gollum to Minas Morgul where they witness the Witch-king of Angmar leading an Orc army to drive Denethor&#39;s younger son Faramir from Gondor&#39;s final defences along the river Anduin. The hobbits begin climbing a precarious stair carved in the cliff face that will take them into Mordor via a &#39;secret way&#39;. But having overheard Gollum&#39;s plot to regain the Ring, Sam keeps a suspicious eye on him. Sauron&#39;s army strikes and overwhelms the city of Osgiliath, forcing Faramir and his garrison to retreat back to Minas Tirith.<p> While helping Th\u00e9oden gather his forces, Aragorn is approached by Elrond who informs him Arwen is dying. Following a vision of her son, she refused to leave Middle Earth. Elrond gives Aragorn the sword And\u00faril, Isildur&#39;s sword Narsil reforged, so he can reclaim his birthright while gaining reinforcements from the Dead Men of Dunharrow. Joined by Legolas and Gimli, Aragorn travels to the Paths of the Dead, recruiting the Army of the Dead. Faramir is gravely wounded after a futile effort to retake Osgiliath, and believing his son to be dead, Denethor falls into madness. Gandalf is left to command the city defences against the Orc army led by Gothmog. But as Gothmog&#39;s forces eventually force their way into the city, Denethor attempts to kill himself and Faramir on a pyre. Pippin alerts Gandalf and they save Faramir, but Denethor leaps to his death from the top of Minas Tirith just before Th\u00e9oden and his nephew, \u00c9omer, arrive with the Rohirrim. Initially, the Rohirrim have the advantage at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, but are eventually overwhelmed by the Oliphaunt-riding Haradrim while the Witch-king mortally wounds Th\u00e9oden. Though Th\u00e9oden&#39;s niece \u00c9owyn, having posed as a male soldier, battles and slays the Witch-King with Merry&#39;s help, Th\u00e9oden dies of his wounds. Aragorn arrives with the Army of the Dead, they overcome the Orcs and win the battle. Aragorn and the other captains of Men decide to lead all who can march upon the Black Gate as a distraction, so Frodo and Sam can get to Mount Doom.<p> Gollum disposes of the last of the pair&#39;s food, blaming Sam. Frodo leaves Sam behind before they arrive at the tunnel leading to Mordor, and is then tricked into venturing into the lair of the giant spider Shelob. Frodo narrowly escapes but is confronted by Gollum. Frodo tells Gollum that he must destroy the Ring for both of their sakes. Enraged, Gollum falls down a chasm after trying to take the Ring. Frodo continues on but is soon discovered by Shelob, who paralyses and binds Frodo. However, Sam arrives and drives Shelob away. Believing Frodo to be dead, Sam hides as orcs appear and learns from them that his friend is still alive, before the goblins take Frodo&#39;s body with them. Sam follows the Orcs into the Tower of Cirith Ungol, determined to rescue Frodo. Once there, he finds that competing bands of Uruks and Morgul Orcs had rioted and killed one another over the possession of Frodo&#39;s Mithril coat, thus providing an opportunity for Sam to escape the tower with Frodo who had awoken shortly before.<p> Aragorn&#39;s army draw out Sauron&#39;s forces and empties Mordor, allowing the exhausted Hobbits to stagger to the volcano, but they are attacked by Gollum just as they reach Mount Doom. Frodo finally succumbs to the Ring&#39;s power and claims it as his own, refusing to destroy it. Gollum attacks Frodo and bites his finger off to reclaim the Ring, but Frodo fights back and knocks Gollum, who is holding the Ring, into the volcano. Both Frodo and Sam then escape the volcano. The Ring and Sauron are both destroyed, causing a chain-reaction that consumes the mountain, topples Barad-d\u00fbr, and kills most of the fleeing Orcs as the ground crumbles beneath them. Gandalf flies in with eagles to rescue the Hobbits, who awaken later in Rivendell and are reunited with the surviving Fellowship members. Aragorn is crowned King of Gondor and takes Arwen as his queen. The Hobbits then return to the Shire where Sam marries Rosie Cotton. Frodo, unable to cope with the traumas of his journey, departs Middle Earth for the Undying Lands with his uncle Bilbo, Gandalf, and the Elves. He leaves Sam the Red Book of Westmarch which details their adventures. Though saddened by Frodo&#39;s departure, Sam is gladdened by the warm welcome he receives from his new family upon returning home.Pizzas:<p> Screening suitable for all ages from 10+ with the accompaniment of an adult.

He then went on to do some studio work with Blind Guardian.\n\nKai and his friend Ralf Scheepers from Tyran' Pace decided to start a project.  They recruited bassist Uwe Wessel and drummer Mathias Burchard.  The resulting sound was very close to Helloween's power metal style.\n\nThe first album Heading For Tomorrow was released in 1990.  Two lineup changes resulted in Uli Kusch (who would later join Helloween) becoming the bands second drummer and Dirk Schlachter becoming a new guitarist.  The new lineup released the Heaven Can Wait EP.\n\nIn 1991 the band released Sigh No More, which resulted in a 50 date world tour.\n\nIn 1993 Uli Kusch left the band and was replaced with Thomas Nack and Jan Rubach who replaced Uwe Wessel as the new bassist.  The resulting cd was Insanity and Genius.  Later that year, along with Rage, Helicon and Conception the band played on a tour called \"Melodic Metal Strikes Back\".  This resulted in a double CD release and video called Power of Metal.  They also released Lust For Live which did not feature the other bands.\n\nThe band were ready to start work on a fourth album, things were put on hold after vocalist Ralf Scheepers auditioned to be the new vocalist for the legendary metal band Judas Priest, his chances were considered good and with no hard feelings, Hansen and Scheepers decided it would be best if Ralf left the band.  Kai Hansen took up guitar and vocal duties.\n\nIn 1995 the album Land of the Free was released, fans and critics were very impressed with the release and it is still considered to be the bands most popular release to date amongst fans.  The band toured and released the live album Alive 95 in 1996.\n\nMore lineup changes resulted in Jan Rubach and Thomas Nack leaving. Dan Zimmerman (who is also a member of Freedom Call) became drummer and Schlachter decided to change from guitarist to bassist.  Henjo Richter was brought in to become the bands new lead guitarist.  This lineup is still the current Gamma Ray lineup as of 2008.\n\n1997 saw the release of a concept album named Somewhere Out In Space, this album focused on the band's fascination with the universe.  The band then toured and finally released the album Powerplant.  This album had a similar approach to lyrics as the previous album but took a new musical approach.  The album was highly acclaimed throughout the world.\n\nThe \"Best of\" album named Blast From The Past was released with songs from the Scheepers era being re recorded with the new members and Hansen on vocals.\n\nAfter the recording of a new album which was yet to be named the band took a year off.\n\nAfter this break, which saw Hansen focusing on side project Iron Savior, the band released No World Order, an album which sounded like no other the band had released.  This album showed the bands main influences, classic metal bands such as Judas Priest and Iron Maiden.  The band set off on the No World Order tour which saw them tour Europe and Japan.  After a short break the band went on tour again, this tour was called the Skeletons In The Closet Tour.  What was special about this tour was that the set list was chosen by fans of Gamma Ray on the offical website.  Two shows were recorded and the album called Skeletons In The Closet was released.\n\nThe next studio album was released in 2005, the first since the 2001 release, No World Order.  This album was called Majestic.  This reached respectable chart positions such as number 20 in Sweden, number 28 in Finland and number 39 in the band's home country Germany.\n\nIn November 2007,  the band released Land of the Free II, a follow up to the 1995 album Land Of The Free which follows the same concept. After the release of this album, Gamma Ray joined up with Helloween for the Hellish Rock tour which ended in October of 2008.\n\nA live DVD was recorded on May 6th, 2006 in Montreal, Quebec. Under the title \"Hell Yeah! The Awesome Foursome (and the Finnish keyboarder who didn't want to wear his Donald Duck costume) Live in Montreal\" and was released on November 4, 2008. The release, which was plagued by setbacks, also included a third disc which contains a road movie shot during the European leg of the Hellish Rock tour in 2008 and 4 songs from \"Land of the Free II\" which were recorded live in Spain.\n\nA companion double live CD was also released on November 4, with the same name and contains all the songs from  the 2006 Montreal concert and the 4 songs recorded in Spain in 2008.\n\nGamma Ray played several festivals in 2009, spending the bulk of the year working on their forthcoming album.

Tickets go on sale this Friday, December 22 at 10 a.m.With, multiple awards and nominations, plus performances on some of the biggest stages in the world, Mercury Nashvilles Easton Corbin has made a lasting impression on the country music landscape. He is lauded for his traditional country sound, authentic lyrics and mastery of understatement. His self-titled debut album released in 2010 and spawned back-to-back hits A Little More Country Than That and Roll With It; making him the first country male artist in 17 years to have his first two consecutive singles reach No. 1. In 2012, the Gilchrist County Florida native released his sophomore album, All Over The Road, which included the Top 5 hits Lovin You Is Fun and All Over The Road. Corbin set a career-best debut on Country Airplay with his top 5 hit single, Baby Be My Love Song,&quot; from his No. 1 debuting album About To Get Real.

He is a consummate showman and shaman, bending successive moments to suit his majestic purposes. Osborne seeks an epic quality to much of his music, crafting layer upon layer of hugely scaled soundscapes....never lazily derivative...every slashing guitar figure, every cry of a lyric, seems to come from an authentic place.&quot;</em> -- <strong>New Orleans Times-Picayune</strong><br> Between the potency of his richly detailed songwriting, his intensely emotional, soulful vocals and his piercing, expert guitar work, New Orleans&#39; Anders Osborne is a true musical treasure. He is among the most original and visionary musicians writing and performing today. Guitar Player calls him &quot;the poet laureate of Louisiana&#39;s fertile roots music scene.&quot; New Orleans&#39; Gambit Weekly has honored Osborne as the Entertainer Of The Year. OffBeat named him the Crescent City&#39;s Best Guitarist for the third year in a row, and the Best Songwriter for the second straight year. Osborne also won Song Of The Year for his composition, Louisiana Gold.<br> Osborne&#39;s latest released\u00a0<strong><em>Flower Box</em></strong>, his second full-length album of 2016, recorded in his hometown of New Orleans late last year,\u00a0<strong><em>Flowerbox</em></strong>is a heavier, guitar-driven follow-up to the acclaimed\u00a0<strong><em>Spacedust & Ocean Views</em></strong>.<br> &quot;I love the way this record comes out stout and determined right out the gate, a four-piece rock & roll band making beautiful and conquering noise,&quot; says\u00a0<strong>Osborne. </strong>&quot;The producer, Mark Howard, has a way of making you play in the moment and being confident. His sounds and engineering style is that of classic records, with his own special sauce of &#39;haunting&#39; on top of it. The musicians on here are undoubtedly some of my absolute favorites in the world, both as players and as people. Their contributions are invaluable. Scott Metzger, Brady Blade, Carl Dufrene, Chad Cromwell, Marc Broussard, David LaBruyere, Rob McNelley & Justin Tocket. Bad boys! I&#39;ve been wanting to make this record for several years and I am stoked it&#39;s finally here.&quot;<br> A powerful live performer, the musician has won over fans through non-stop touring as well as a heralded collaboration with the\u00a0<strong>North Mississippi Allstars</strong>\u00a0&\u00a0<strong>Southern Soul Assembly</strong>.<br> Jambands.com said, &quot;Osborne finds a striking balance of muscle and grace that allows for the smaller moments of quiet to be just as resounding as the sonic booms.&quot; And USA Today has praised his music, saying &quot;The relentless approach amplifies the anguished lyrics, which appear to be about the death of a loved one or a relationship torn asunder or perhaps a spiritual crisis.&quot; In a review of\u00a0<strong><em>Spacedust & Ocean Views</em></strong>, Boulder Weekly said the album &quot;finds the guitarist in a (largely) reflective mood, an extended meditation on place and moments in time, memory, passages through and exits from paragraphs in the non-fiction docudrama of life. Through languid, gently formed figures, Osborne coaxes odes of gratitude and compelling imagery in what seems a little like a travelogue -- like watching his kid chasing seabirds on the beach...&quot;<br> Osborne has earned hordes of new fans. He has toured virtually non-stop, either with his own band, as a solo artist, or as a guest with his countless musical admirers, including Toots and The Maytals, Stanton Moore, Derek Trucks, Warren Haynes, Keb Mo, The Grateful Dead&#39;s Phil Lesh, Jackie Greene and Karl Denson&#39;s Tiny Universe. He&#39;s produced and played on critically acclaimed albums by Tab Benoit, Johnny Sansone and Mike Zito.<br> Since his recording debut in 1989, Osborne has written virtually all of his own material and contributed memorable songs to a wide variety of artists. Two tunes co-written by Osborne appear on Keb Mo&#39;s Grammy-winning 1999 release Slow Down. Country superstar Tim McGraw scored a #1 hit with Anders&#39; song Watch The Wind Blow By. Osborne&#39;s compositions have been covered by artists as diverse as Brad Paisley, Tab Benoit, Jonny Lang, Edwin McCain, Sam Bush, Trombone Shorty and Aaron Neville and Kim Carnes. His songs have appeared in multiple feature films. He can also be seen performing in an episode of HBO&#39;s New Orleans-based drama, Treme.<br><br><br><strong>Ryan Montbleau</strong><br> Ryan Montbleau has been an acclaimed singer, songwriter, and bandleader for more than a decade, but with his new album\u00a0I WAS JUST LEAVING, the New England-based artist has truly arrived. Contemplative and richly emotive, the album offers a glimpse into the often-lonesome life of the relentlessly traveling troubadour, a strikingly single-minded existence too often clouded by the blur of constant motion. Recorded at New Orleans\u2019 Esplanade Studios over four days in January 2016 with producer Anders Osborne and engineer/mixer Mark Howard (known for his work with such icons as\u00a0Bob Dylan,\u00a0Tom Waits,\u00a0Neil Young, and U2), the album marks Montbleau\u2019s first full length release in the wake of a series of seismic personal shifts.

The original members of the group were Janet Ertel (1913-November 4, 1988), Carol Bushman (her sister-in-law), Dorothy Schwartz, and Jinny Osborn (or Lockard) (April 25, 1927-May 19, 2003). In 1952, Lynn Evans replaced Schwartz, and in 1953, Margie Needham replaced Osborn (who was having a baby), though Osborn later returned to the group. Nancy Overton also was a member of the group at a later time. Originally they sang folk music in the style of The Weavers, but eventually changed to a harmonizing style of the type known as barbershop harmony. Part of this change seems to be influenced by Osborn's father.\n\nJinny Osborn was born in Seattle, Washington. She was born Virginia Cole, the daughter of O. H. \"King\" Cole, who was president of the Barbershop Harmony Society (then known as SPEBSQSA), and Katherine Flack.\n\nAfter performing locally in Sheboygan, they went on Arthur Godfrey's radio program, Talent Scouts in 1949.They went on to feature status on Godfrey's daily program, and then went on to make a number of recordings for Columbia Records.\n\nIn 1953, Godfrey's music director and orchestra leader, Archie Bleyer, founded Cadence Records. He signed a number of Godfrey regulars and former regulars, including the Chordettes, who had a number of hit records for Cadence.\n\nTheir biggest hit was Mr. Sandman in 1954. Archie Bleyer himself is on that record along with the group, Bleyer stripping the sound down the better not to clutter the girls' voices. They also hit the top twenty with 1958's \"Lollipop,\" and also charted with a vocal version of the themes from television's Zorro (1959) and the film Never on Sunday (1961). Other hits for the girls included \"Eddie My Love,\" \"Born to Be With You,\" and \"Lay Down Your Arms\" in 1956 and \"Just Between You and Me\" in 1957.\n\nJanet Ertel married Bleyer in 1954.

ABOUT FACTOR CHANDELIERThe ruins of the failed city of Factoria lie under the residential subdivision of Silverwood Heights in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, the hometown of producer extraordinaire Graham Murawsky (aka Factor Chandelier). Just prior to World War I, Chicago entrepreneur Robert E. Glass ventured north with dreams of building an elaborate industrial city in a formerly typhoid-riddled area that would house a brick plant, flour mill, brewery, school, post office, restaurant, hotel, and whatever else progress would afford. But before his development plans could come into fruition, war, the cessation of banks issuing credit, and the inability to secure electrical power turned Factoria into a ghost town. Inspired by the obscure story of the Magic City that never was, Factor Chandelier has crafted a 13-track album that pays homage to Factoria and wonders what could have been.On the Factoria LP, Chandeliers follow-up to the 2013 concept album Woke Up Alone, he builds a city of expansive beats that bang with punishing drums and industrial clatter at one moment and exude a melodic, pastoral calm the next. The sounds shift on the album in accordance with the hope that the city began with and the wartime entropy that engulfed it. Recorded and mixed by Factor at his Chandelier Studios in Saskatoon, the album incorporates the bass of Enver Hampton, violin and guitar from The Pxrtals, and guest vocals from a host of Fake Four family and friends.Factoria opens up with The Magic City, a glossy, post-apocalyptic instrumental reminiscent of Ratatat segueing into Kirby Dominants geographical cure pondering on the upbeat title track. Open Mike Eagle brings his emotive, pensive musings to Dozer II while Awol One, Gregory Pepper, and Ceschi reunite over the funky bass of Noise Band, a gloomy, self-deprecating sequel to their 2009 collaboration with Factor on Back Then. Myka 9 explores the concept of building through an abstract historical context on Shoulders of Giants before Old Organs closes out the record with crashing drums, eerie organs, and wraith-like wails.What may have driven Glass to Factoria, beyond monetary gain, is the desire to create something in his vision, to build a city of infinite possibilities where people could settle and seek their fortune amongst a serene central Canadian backdrop. On the same hallowed ground, Factor Chandelier has built a decade and a half worth of beats for Canadian comrades, west coast underground legends, and indie rap cult heroes from all over the map. Augmented by Factors chemistry with emcees he has worked with for years, Factoria is a beacon illuminating the streets that paved over the ruins of the Magic City.", "img": null, "title": "Ceschi and Factor Chandelier", "url": "http://portland.eventful.com/events/ceschi-and-factor-chandelier-/E0-001-109523820-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Mississippi Studios", "city": "Portland"}, {"date": "2018-02-23 23:00:00", "description": " <em><strong>Set Times: Goodrich 11pm, Ceschi 11:20, Moodie Black 12am, Murf 1am</strong></em><p>\u00a0<p>\u00a0<p>\u00a0<br><strong>Moodie Black:</strong><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=\"http://www.moodieblack.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">artist website</a><br><br><p>Moodie Black has seemingly appeared out of thin air, rising from disintegrated dusting&#39;s of a newly popular genre- noise rap - with a recent featured article in international French publication New Noise, a Death Grips remix, and collaborations with emcee Dalek, Moodie Black has stirred some curiosity.<br>Shaped and formed in the deserts of Arizona, Moodie Black pulled themselves from the dust, undaunted by criticism for their abrasive sound and controversial stage shows since 2004.

Outfitted with disembodied baby heads tethered to gold chains, Moodie Black is visceral, melodic, and of course devastatingly moody.

Born Regan Farquhar, the Los Angeles MC was introduced to hip-hop culture early \u2013 his father wrote the screenplay to one of the earliest films focusing on hip-hop, Krush Groove. He began rapping at age nine, releasing his first record at age 13 with his group, 4/29, named after the 1992 L.A. riots. By the mid-'90s, Busdriver was a regular at the Project Blowed open mic, where he would meet future collaborators and underground luminaries like Aceyalone, Abstract Rude, and Freestyle Fellowship. And shortly after, the vinyl did flow. \n\nBusdriver guested on upward of 20 singles, and by 2001 he could no longer be contained by guest spots, releasing his first full-length, Memoirs of the Elephant Man (1999). There were just as many detractors as supporters for his singular style, which was so densely packed it made his chosen name seem a reference for multiple-personality disorder, and the lo-fi production also left more listeners scratching heads than nodding them. \n\nHis next album, This Machine Kills Fashion Tips (2002), continued in a similar manner before being trumped by better production and more focused rhymes on Temporary Forever the same year. Joined by another West Coast avant-garde MC, Radioinactive, and the breezy, fractured pop of electronic producer Daedelus, Busdriver released yet another odd puzzle piece in 2003, The Weather. Fear of a Black Tangent followed on Mush in 2005. After moving to Anti-/Epitaph, the rapper issued RoadKillOvercoat, which featured production from Nobody and Boom Bip. His second Anti- release, Jhelli Beam, appeared in 2009. In 2010 he put out a full-length mixtape of unreleased gems and illegal remixes called Computer Cooties. It was released as a free album. 2010 saw Bus toiling over a new album that will shock fans and confuse the unconverted into unwilling servitude. It is called Beaus$Eros  and was released on February 21, 2012 on Fake Four. Beaus$Eros forgoes the lightening-speed rhyming that defined his style in favor of a diverse, off-kilter brand of pop and post-hip-hop. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Busdriver\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

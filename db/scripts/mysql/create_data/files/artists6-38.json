Fusing various influences from post-rock to folk to ambient, various members have at different times played in other North Queensland based groups such as Joseph Liddy and the Skeleton Horse, The Forest, and We Are Buildings.\n\nAfter completing several East Coast tours, they released a split EP in 2006 with local Cairns band Sleeping in Trains. Their debut album The Recordings of the Middle East was released on 24th April 2008, shortly before the band announced their first split. They reconvened eight months later, and in the autumn of 2009 released their album in the United States as an abridged EP, also called The Recordings of the Middle East.\n\nTheir song \"Blood\" is featured in the films Accidents Happen, It's Kind of a Funny Story. and Crazy, Stupid, Love, as well as in an episode of the Australian television comedy-drama series Offspring and an advertisement for European bank BNP Paribas.\n\nAt the start of their appearance at 2011's Splendour in the Grass music festival, the band announced that their set that night would be their last show ever, thanking fans in attendance for making their finale special for the band. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Middle+East\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Jazz would never have happened without the blues, which came out of the gospel tradition - and blues is the foundation of contemporary Western culture and pop/soul music, and so on.&quot; <br><br>Polly has cultivated her craft and eclecticism over the past decade, performing at all the leading UK jazz clubs, international festivals and as a regular at the legendary venue Ronnie Scott&#39;s Jazz Club, where she has sung with the All-Stars, led by pianist and house musical director James Pearson. &quot;There&#39;s always this element of surprise from people who haven&#39;t seen her perform,&quot; says Pearson, Polly&#39;s longtime songwriting collaborator and arranger. &quot;She astounds me, too. She&#39;s unpredictable.&quot; In 2016, she opened the sold out UK tours for George Benson and Gladys Knight and had two acclaimed performances at the Royal Albert Hall. She was also a featured singer with the Liverpool Philharmonic in a presentation of the music and life story of John Lennon. <br><br>Polly is quickly establishing herself in the States as well, with shows these past few years in Florida, Boston, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Oklahoma City, Los Angeles and Birdland in NYC. She released her critically acclaimed UK debut album My Own Company in 2014. <br><br>Sharing Polly&#39;s belief that creativity and art are our greatest gifts and that it&#39;s the artist&#39;s obligation to share their innermost truths is George Klabin, the legendary jazz producer who signed her to his label, Resonance Records and released her U.S. debut Many Faces of Love in 2015. Klabin&#39;s production on Is It Me...? has grown in line with the emotional depth of her voice and her innate musical curiosity. She&#39;s especially excited by the buoyant seven-piece horn section, which enhances both her R&B and big band swing vibes. The piano and most of the arranging are shared by Pearson and Tamir Hendelman, the Israeli born, L.A. based jazz pianist to the stars, including Barbra Streisand and the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra. <br><br>A farmer&#39;s daughter who grew up in Framlingham, a small market town in Suffolk, England, Polly is one of seven siblings in a family that shared all types of different musical loves. Her mum cherished classical and choral music (Bach, Mozart, Chopin), her dad was an electric bassist who played in bands in the 70&#39;s, her brothers loved R&B and her sisters were all vinyl collections, playing everything from hip hop and soul to jazz and folk. <br><br>Polly took obligatory piano lessons at age four, but didn&#39;t realize she could sing till she was around 13. Crippled by an initial shyness, at her first public performance at a school Christmas concert, she sang with her back to the audience. Though she sang hymns regularly at the Baptist church her family attended, her musical sensibilities were galvanized when her sister played Billie Holiday&#39;s &quot;I&#39;m A Fool To Want You&quot; -- which Polly found &quot;extraordinary!&quot; <br><br>Inspired by Billie, the budding singer experienced an initial flurry of excitement in discovering jazz and blues, listening to such artists as Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, Nina Simone, Miles Davis, Donny Hathaway, Thelonious Monk, etc. She notes, however, that although she doesn&#39;t have a very &quot;folky&quot; voice, she was also greatly influenced by artists like Joni Mitchell, Leonard Cohen, Rickie Lee Jones and Bob Dylan, and she continuously listens to classical music, too! Participating in a local music workshop, she met British singer Ian Shaw, who took Polly under his wing and secured her first gig in London when she was 17. Participating in other workshops, she cultivated her talent with bassist Gill Alexander, Jacqui Dankworth (daughter of Cleo Laine) and later, James Pearson. <br><br>Reflecting on her subsequent success on the British club scene, Polly says, &quot;I have found that singing is most inspiring for me when I bring a certain lightness of being to it, a certain joy and levity that allows me to communicate more fully with my audience - as if each moment was both ordinary and extraordinary at the same time. I have learned to follow my passion wherever it leads me. It&#39;s a fascinating journey that&#39;s always in flux and there are always exciting new goals to work towards.&quot; <br><br>Polly&#39;s road now leads her to one of those extraordinary places with the release of Is It Me...? The album is a journey all its own - a culmination of so many moments that also signifies a meaningful new beginning for both the singer and contemporary jazz.</p>", "img": null, "title": "Polly Gibbons", "url": "http://boston.eventful.com/events/polly-gibbons-/E0-001-110056758-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "The Charles Hotel", "city": "Cambridge"}, {"date": "2018-02-15 20:00:00", "description": "Ryan McCullough and Lucy Fitz Gibbon present a recital for piano and voice featuring works by John Harbison and James Primosch, including a world premiere.", "img": null, "title": "Ryan McCullough and Lucy Fitz Gibbon: CU Music", "url": "http://eventful.com/ithaca/events/ryan-mccullough-and-lucy-fitz-gibbon-cu-music-/E0-001-110203835-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Barnes Hall Auditorium", "city": "Ithaca"}, {"date": "2018-02-15 20:00:00", "description": "Julian made his TV debut with Acker Bilk when he was just 14, and has played on concert, club, festival and broadcast dates with his own band and with these stars.

When an ascending singer-songwriter pursues a movie-worthy international love story and chronicles it in a collection of hybrid soundscapes, it\u2019s worth sitting up and paying attention. Sara Swenson\u2019s fourth studio album \u2014 the July 2014 release\u00a0Runway Lights\u00a0\u2014 captures snapshots of her 18-month experience of living abroad, moving from dating to marriage and sorting through the accompanying transitions and emotions. Produced by Don Chaffer,\u00a0Runway Lights\u00a0melds Swenson\u2019s compelling vocals with pop, folk, soul and electronic/ambient textures to deliver her strongest and most personal work to date.\u00a0This giant creative step forward comes in succession of other leaps in Swenson\u2019s relatively fresh music career. In just 2007, the Kansas City high school English teacher first tried her hand at songwriting at the offhand suggestion of a guitar salesman. Fast forward four years, and Swenson already had released three records (Sara Swenson, 2008, prod. by Chaffer;\u00a0All Things Big and Small, 2010, prod. by Chaffer;\u00a0Never Left My Mind, 2011, prod. by Mike Crawford). In that time frame, she also had picked up two Kansas City Singer-Songwriter of the Year awards, performed with Sarah McLachlan\u2019s Lilith Fair, and placed a song on the season finale of ABC\u2019s \u201cPrivate Practice.\u201d And the step beyond that? That\u2019s Swenson\u2019s most recent chapter \u2014\u00a0following love to another country, getting married, and funneling her stories into this newest creative work,\u00a0Runway Lights.

A synergy between influences including trip-hop, acoustic, soul and RnB, Hybrid Minds draw on a myriad of influences to produce the smooth sound they are now known for. \n\nAlthough an innovative force in Liquid Drum and Bass, Matt & Josh are no strangers to bass music & had ran a record label together for many years which focused on the more dancefloor orientated side of the genre. \n\nHowever, after drifting towards the more melodic side of Drum and Bass, They decided to use their talent to make some smoother collaborations. After only a few joint efforts, Hybrid Minds immediately shot to the forefront of the Liquid scene, with many household names playing tracks from the newly formed duo. Their method of bouncing ideas off each other in the studio yielded immediate results with one of their first tracks \u2018The Place\u2019, becoming one of the biggest tracks of 2011. This track features some of the elements that now make up Hybrid Minds\u2019 distinctive, soulful sound. \n\nSince then, this fresh new two piece have gone from strength to strength, with their smooth, melodic brand of Liquid gaining them releases on some of the most respected labels on the scene.

Portland musicians Timothy Horner (violin) and Bill Slater (piano/bass) later joined the group to record their first EP.\n\nThe band then released two self-financed EPs in 2000 and 2001. Paul Spitz left the US to travel in Turkey and Zak Riles joined as guitarist, often playing more of an acoustic role. In 2002 Hall sent a promotion CD to Neurot Recordings who were convinced of the band's potential.\nIn 2003, just before the release of their first full-length album, the band changed its name to Grails. They adopted a louder, more aggressive style, often switching instruments with each member writing songs that saw them branching out to increasingly disparate styles.\n\nBy the time the Black Tar Prophecies series was released Timothy Horner left and the band carried on with only 4 players. The group often picks up an extra musician for tours, allowing Amos to switch between guitar and drums and expanding the live instrumentation. Recently, Randall Dunn and Dave Abramson have joined the group live.\n\nIn their early years, Grails only toured Europe but have switched to focusing on the East Coast of the United States in the last few years. Despite living in Portland, the band rarely plays live shows in their hometown.\nThe various members stay busy with several different projects. Hall has played guitar with Steve Von Till of Neurosis in Von Till's project Harvestman , Amos has played drums with Jandek, produced for Yellow Swans and releases solo records under the name 'Holy Sons', and Riles has toured as 2nd guitarist for M. Ward.\n\nIn 2007 Grails released Burning off Impurities with Temporary Residence.\nIn March 2008 it was announced that Emil Amos joined OM and a new Grails record called Take Refuge in Clean Living was released May 13 on Important Records. Their latest full-length album, Doomsdayer's Holiday was released on October 7, 2008, on Temporary Residence Limited. The album was met with critical acclaim, and the band were featured on the cover of UK magazine Rock-A-Rolla.\n\nA comprehensive DVD was released on April 7,'09 called \"Acid Rain\" summing up their most productive period.

We just chase it like a predator or dawn on the heels of darkness. The primordial bond between instinct and passion drives Kimbras 2018 third full-length album, Primal Heart [Warner Bros. Records]. An admission during the track Human, I got a heart thats primal, codifies a poignant, prescient, and pervasive theme for the art pop songstress. It tapped on an interesting rawness about what it means to have a heart that cries out for love as a primal need, she exclaims. Theres a vulnerability to that as well as a sense of coming back to truth. The Primal Heart is full both fear and self-preservation like an animal, but there is also a longing to transcend and evolve.The same could be said of Kimbra. Since emerging in 2010, she has continually evolved. 2012 saw her become a household name after dueting with Gotye on the ubiquitous RIAA quadruple-platinum-certified Somebody That I Used To Know. It went on to win both Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 2013 GRAMMY Awards, and she made history as the third New Zealand singer to win a GRAMMY. 2014s The Golden Echo found her progressing yet again and receiving the endorsement of Paste, Los Angeles Times, Spin, Consequence of Sound and more along the way.Over the course of two years to follow, she pondered what would eventually become Primal Heart. Travel and time (nearly three years to be exact) provided perspective that proved invaluable to this latest body of work. I knew I couldnt rush the album before it felt ready to manifest, she admits. I came out of a whirlwind few years of touring. I was bouncing from accommodations without having really settled into a home. I also moved everything I owned from L.A. to New York via a 14-day road trip. I was a sponge absorbing and searching for what I wanted to say next and who I felt I was becoming as an artist and as a woman. I wanted to find an objective counterpart and formulate a more intentional and committed approach.Enter GRAMMY Award-winning producer John Congleton [Lana Del Rey, St. Vincent]. Co-producing Primal Heart together, the music represents a leap in confidence for the singer. That jump can, in part, be credited to performing improvisational music and unlocking, radical fearlessness when approaching songwriting and vocal expression. At the same time, she built up her New York studio one piece of gear at a time and admittedly embraced her inner geek.I think the production really serves the emotion all across this record, she continues. I consider each sonic choice very carefully, but Im also learning through Johns help that it is just music and you cant be too precious about keeping every idea. In some ways, we took a more punk rock mentality to the process. What mattered most was the feeling, and if it felt a bit uncomfortable and exposed, then we were probably on to something. The first single Everybody Knows elegantly stiches together metronomic xylophone, woozy synths, and an unpredictable bass thud as her voice takes center stage, blossoming from delicate verses into a definitive hook, Now the whole worlds watching you.To me, its a song thats about awakening to some kind of truth, Kimbra elaborates. Its very easy to suppress and deny toxic situations, but then they rise up in time of catharsis and demand our courage. Its hard to look at something in the face and see it for what it is. But when you finally do, thats when you experience true freedom. Elsewhere on the record, a tribal stomp, finger-snaps, and video game-style flourishes warble under Kimbras spellbinding delivery during The Good War. The ebullient and energetic Black Sky slips into a noir-ish croon for Past Love. The record seamlessly tempers moments of bass-heavy empowerment and strength with intimate vulnerability, covering a gamut of emotions and moods.I wanted this record to feel more raw and hungry than Ive been before, and I knew that meant I had to access and explore the vulnerable side of myself, she states. People wont know everything thats behind the veil, but theyll get a little more. Meanwhile, she teamed up for Skrillex on the world music-induced global spiral of Top of the World.Sonny and I became friends after we met at Coachella one year, she recalls. Then we just ended up hanging at his house one night with Miguel, Thundercat and a bunch of friends. Before we knew it, we were all jamming. It led us to want to do more. We bonded a lot over the fact were both massively into Meshuggah, she laughs. We established common ground. Thats when special stuff happens.Primal Heart is Kimbra at her most passionate and powerful. It reflects more of where I am at my life, she leaves off. Its a stripping back of layers and an openness that I felt ready to share: the central core that binds us.", "img": null, "title": "Kimbra", "url": "http://minneapolis.eventful.com/events/kimbra-/E0-001-108562705-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "The Cedar Cultural Center", "city": "Minneapolis"}, {"date": "2018-04-19 20:00:00", "description": " Die Gewinner des Deutschen Rock & Poppreises nulldB haben ihr k\u00fcnstlerisches Zuhause bei Sony Music gefunden.

Vagina China is a large-scale community art project by The Women&#39;s Art League. We are creating a ceramic art exhibition, &quot;Vagina China,&quot; that celebrates, honors and demystifies the female body\u2014specifically, the vulva and the vagina\u2014the source of life, and all her variations of shape, size and figure.\u00a0 We are making 13 different collections of Vagina China, each referencing classical pottery patterns and adorned with cast vulvas. Each set explores current issues that impact women today\u2014from periods to pleasure, from sex work to social activism. In order to create Vagina China, we host &quot;Casting Ceremonies&quot; and invite women from the community to make art together, share, and cast their vulvas (to be used on the plates that we later create.)\u00a0 We create a relaxing, safe and sacred space with materials and instruction for encouraging our intrinsic creative voice and connecting to our primal source of creative inspiration. Think soft lights, aromatics, hot tea, pulsating music, art materials of all fancy\u2014and chocolate for inspiration. Then we gather in circle and the magic begins\u2014intentions are shared, fears are released, and deep connections and bonds are born. We demonstrate the casting process and hand out long shirts for privacy, and individual containers full of Algi-safe casting material. Each women is soley in charge of her\u00a0cast. Casts are anonymous and the casting process is private. Casting Ceremonies are open to anyone who identifies as a woman.

Each set explores current issues that impact women today\u2014from periods to pleasure, from sex work to social activism. In order to create Vagina China, we host &quot;Casting Ceremonies&quot; and invite women from the community to make art together, share, and cast their vulvas (to be used on the plates that we later create.)\u00a0 We create a relaxing, safe and sacred space with materials and instruction for encouraging our intrinsic creative voice and connecting to our primal source of creative inspiration.\u00a0Think soft lights, aromatics, hot tea, pulsating music, art materials of all fancy\u2014and chocolate for inspiration. Then we gather in circle and the magic begins\u2014intentions are shared, fears are released, and deep connections and bonds are born.

Because of my lemon body, I understand hunger at a very primal level. I understand how food (or a lack of food) can separate you from participating in social interactions. All of that sucks. But, it has given me the energy to find a way to get healthy food from supermarket shelves to the people who need most.

It will explain what hypnosis is, and give you the tools to master a simple and effective Hypnotic Induction, allowing you to guide your subject into a state of Trance where you can then give positive suggestions to\u00a0create intense feelings of relaxation, happiness, and pleasure. You will learn how to explain experiencing trance to a subject in a positive way and guide them skillfully\u00a0into a deep and relaxing state of openness to pleasure and satisfaction. Finally, you will learn to use\u00a0Proximity, Presence, Primality and Sensuality\u00a0to\u00a0entrance, enchant and delight your partner and to evoke deep pleasure states, delicious emotion, arousal, and satisfaction. In this\u00a0Beginning Erotic Hypnosis\u00a0Workshop, we will cover: What can be\u00a0achieved with Hypnosis, and how to make it sexy and fun for both parties. How to avoid any potential pitfalls and work safely with a subject. How Erotic Hypnosis is different from Therapeutic or Stage Hypnosis. Creating a comfortable and relaxed atmosphere of exploration and playfulness to facilitate shared pleasure. What it feels like to be hypnotised, and why it\u2019s so compelling (and why people keep coming back!). The Roadmap for becoming a great erotic hypnotist or a responsive subject. How to create simple \u201ctriggers\u201d so that you can enter - and make your partner enter - trance quickly and enjoy deep relaxation. Seamlessly incorporating Erotic Trance into your existing life, so you don\u2019t have to go and meditate on a mountaintop for ten years to share incredible pleasure with your partner. If you are curious about the workshop content, please send me an email at\u00a0contact@thewordsmithspeaks.com\u00a0and I&#39;d be happy to answer any questions you might have.\u00a0 You will walk out at the end of this workshop knowing how to: Negotiate a simple erotic hypnosis scene with a partner (involving an induction, a deepener, suggestions, and emergence). Defuse any fears or concerns your partner might have about going into trance. Use an easy-to-learn and powerful induction to create a state of trance in your partner. Deepen that state of trance by utilising shared experiences and visualizations to\u00a0feel great, together. Give your subject a \u201cTrigger\u201d so you can drop them back into a wonderfully relaxed, hypnotised state in seconds. Create powerful positive emotions (Happiness, Relaxation, Joy, etc) Focus and direct your subjects attention and create an exchange of erotic energy. Seamlessly incorporate what you\u2019ve learned into your existing sexual and erotic play. The most valuable workshops are the ones where you are able to take home what you learn\u00a0and immediately begin utilising and exploring with it, and this workshop has been designed to be applicable and engaging so that you actually\u00a0use these skills to create incredible intimacy with your chosen partners. If you are curious about the workshop content, please send me an email at\u00a0contact@thewordsmithspeaks.com\u00a0and I&#39;ll be happy to talk it over and answer any questions you might have.\u00a0 Frequently Asked Questions :) What intensity can I expect? Two out of Five Spicy Chicken Wings. There will be discussions and a demonstration of (fully clothed) erotic content. Everyone will be offered the opportunity to be both Hypnotist and Subject, but every attendee is free to participate only to the level at which they find themselves comfortable. Who is this workshop aimed at? Will I fit in? It is aimed at people who are curious about learning to hypnotise other people and to, later on, combine trance with sexual intent, energy and action. Those who would like to experience Erotic Hypnosis for the first time in a fun, safe and welcoming environment are most welcome at this workshop, as are curious adventurers of all types attracted by the mystery and power of Erotic Hypnosis. Does this classify as therapy? What if I am uncomfortable with sexual content? This class is not for learning Hypnotherapy, or for doing Therapy work. Anyone uncomfortable with conversations around sexuality, eroticism, power transfer or hypnosis would be advised to try a different workshop. \u00a0Does this Workshop include Pair Work? Yes, it does include pair work, as the best way to learn how to hypnotise others is to actually do it. If you come with a partner, you are more than welcome to work with them for the entire evening. However changing practice partners and roles (Hypnotist or Subject) is strongly recommended to maximise skills development, but not essential.\u00a0 Will there be nudity involved? No, this workshop and all practice during the workshop is conducted fully clothed. However, there will an email sent post-workshop with suggestions for including Nudity and Intimate Touch into your Hypnosis Practice with a partner in the privacy of your own home.\u00a0 Am I able to sit out and just observe if it gets too much? You may sit out of any activity, or participate only to a level that&#39;s right for you. What level of Practical vs Theory will there be? The Workshop is about 25 percent discussion, 75 percent hands-on Practice and Experience. Do I need to bring anything with me? Yourself, a willing partner (only if you have\u00a0one, if you don\u2019t that\u2019s okay) and a sense of adventure. What should I wear? Comfortable, non-constrictive, casual clothing. About your Facilitator\u00a0 The Wordsmith is a Master Hypnotist and Lifestyle Dominant, active in the Melbourne Kink Scene. He has used erotic hypnosis for over a decade to create powerful and intimate connections, facilitate consensual\u00a0power exchange and train slaves and dominants to fully embrace their shadow selves and seek the deeper meaning in their relationships. He now turns his attention to teaching a variety of workshops to empower others to share in the delights and depths of trance. He is writing a book.

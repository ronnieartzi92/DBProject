It was released in June 2013 as the first single from Avicii's full-length debut studio album, True, which was released on 17 September 2013.\n\nAvicii introduced \"Wake Me Up\" for the first time live on stage at the Ultra Music Festival in Miami. The experimental rendering (it was accompanied by a live band with instruments and vocalists, including Aloe Blacc) reportedly confused and angered a section of the electronic dance festival community. Subsequently however, Avicii achieved critical and commercial success with the release of the single worldwide. \"Wake Me Up\" peaked at number one in much of Europe and charted well in all of the English-speaking world. The song has been described as a \"summer anthem\" by Variance Magazine and, throughout the 2013 festival season, Avicii included it as part of the opening or closing sequence of his sets at EDC Las Vegas, EDC London, Tomorrowland, Creamfields, Electric Zoo and iTunes Festival. In the United States \"Wake Me Up!\" managed to peak at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Avicii/_/Wake+Me+Up\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They&#39;ve headlined every AAA venue in North America including LIV, Pacha, Create, The Mid, The Hoxton, Ruby Skye, Foundation, Elektricity and Beta. They did this all while holding down a monthly residency at the #1 nightclub in the United States, XS, whose other DJs include Megaclub juggernauts such as Avicii, Deadmau5, David Guetta, and Zedd. Besides the top clubs and festivals in the U.S. scene, they&#39;ve headlined in Paris, Geneva, Milan, Athens, and other European cities, then hopped over the Pacific to hit up legendary Australian clubs such as Pacha, Oh Hello, and HQ.

The album, created over two years, reflects an equal amalgamation of the myriad influences from which Seaver and Light draw as well as their deep-rooted experience on the road, in the studio, on the stage and in everyday life. All together, Hourglass is the latest and most robust chapter in the MAKO storyline, a growing tale told up to date in the albums 12 tracks. Still, to understand Hourglass requires a deep dive into MAKOs makeup and creative dynamic.To hear it told from inception, the history of MAKO is much like listening to the unfolding of a modern-day legend. Seaver, a multifaceted, classically trained musician and gifted graduate of the lauded Juilliard School in NYC, moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in film composing where he met Light by way of their fathers, who were once college roommates. A devotee to the indie rock circles of the day, Light was making waves in his own right as he began to master the DJ decks, gaining enough momentum to attain opening slots for EDM giants Tisto and Avicii. Following a storied trip to the EDM mega-festival Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas, where Seaver was thrown headfirst into the electronic music world, the two friends formed MAKO.In no time, MAKO became one of the hottest acts in the electronic music world. Their first release, Beam, amassed more than 25 million online views and streams. Between their own remixes and work for others they amassed multiple Hype Machine #1s. SiriusXM quickly jumped on board, anointing them the next big thing, and the rest of the electronic musical community followed suit. MAKO have since worked alongside many top artists, including Avicii and Steve Angello. Additionally, Seaver has scored music for and worked alongside League Of Legends/Riot Games on a variety of projects, as well as has scored for independent film, television and several commercials.On the touring front, MAKO have played high-profile festivals, including Coachella, Lollapalooza, EDC Las Vegas, TomorrowWorld, Electric Forest, Electric Zoo, and more, in addition to headlining their own club tours. Hourglass, then, is the next progression.Sewn deep into the DNA of Hourglass lies a distinct hybrid musicality layered with MAKOs diverse backgrounds and unique interests stepping forward to present a new, consolidated sound. Dig into Let Go of the Wheel, where a serene guitar-and-piano combo pair beautifully with Seavers love-hued lyrics which explode as he sings of simpler times and future days. Real Life shines through powerfully and showcases an endearing take on indie rock sensibilities.The album also features their 2015 breakthrough single Smoke Filled Room, which soared into pop and dance radio airplay charts via continuous support on SiriusXMs BPM and iHeartRadios Evolution channels and landed at #1 on the Dance Airplay chart. Wish You Back features Kwesi and offers a touching, self-reflective tale of love lost built over a cinematic arch, while Dutch house duo The Him offers a bouncy, alternate take of the track with club-friendly charm and serves as a bonus track on the album.Other standout tracks include North Dakota, a stunning and unique soulful ballad about finding solace outside of the big city; Run for Your Life, which is three minutes of pop genius produced with the help of Seavers Norwegian friend, Rat City and features a guest vocal from Natalola; and Craziest Day I Ever Had, a hilarious tale of misadventure in Los Angeles. The album closes with Our Story (Hourglass Finale), an anthemic rework of MAKOs ode to childhood innocence.The biggest challenge was staring at a completely blank canvas and thinking, I can fill this with literally anything. What do I want to say? says Seaver of Hourglass. To really develop a voice was the most challenging aspect of this project.We wanted to expand our sound to create something that shows both of our backgrounds and influences and try to make something new out of that, adds Light.While the beginnings of Hourglass date back to 2014, it was a performance at this years Lake George Music Festival (August 2016) that helped realize the groups artistic potential. Here, MAKO collaborated with the festivals 40-piece classical orchestra to create unique arrangements of the duos original music. The result: The lush complexities and beefy layers of Seavers professional training in classical music meshed beautifully with Lights love for the modern, the edgy, and the electronic, as heard fully throughout Hourglass.With Hourglass, MAKO bid farewell to their former style of dance floor burners and hands-in-the-air beats with an evolved sound reaching toward the vast beyond: sincere, story-based songwriting; cinematic arrangements and orchestral instrumentation; and indie rock stylings the size of stadium anthems, all while retaining a twist of electronic goodness. Ultimately, its wide-reaching composite draws listeners into the duos personal story with glimpses into their future sound, while remaining organically MAKO.We hope the people who have been along for the ride with us will love the direction we&#39;ve chosen, says Seaver.

He offered it as a Witmark music publishing demo in that month\u2014a version that was finally released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1\u20133 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961\u20131991. The song was then recorded in the Columbia studios in New York on the 23rd and 24th October, and the latter yielded the version that became the title song of Dylan's third album.\nDylan recalled writing the song as a deliberate attempt to create an anthem of change for the moment. In 1985, he told Cameron Crowe: \"This was definitely a song with a purpose. It was influenced of course by the Irish and Scottish ballads ...'Come All Ye Bold Highway Men', 'Come All Ye Tender Hearted Maidens'. I wanted to write a big song, with short concise verses that piled up on each other in a hypnotic way. The civil rights movement and the folk music movement were pretty close for a while and allied together at that time.\"\nDylan biographer Clinton Heylin recounts how Tony Glover stopped by Dylan's apartment in September 1963, picked up a page of the song Dylan was working on and read a line from it: \"Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call.' Turning to Dylan, Glover said, 'What is this shit, man?' Dylan shrugged his shoulders and replied, 'Well, you know, it seems to be what the people want to hear.\"\nDylan critic Michael Gray called it \"the archetypal protest song.\" Gray commented, \"Dylan's aim was to ride upon the unvoiced sentiment of a mass public\u2014to give that inchoate sentiment an anthem and give its clamour an outlet. He succeeded, but the language of the song is nevertheless imprecisely and very generally directed.\" Gray suggests that the song has been outdated by the very changes that it gleefully predicted, and hence the song was politically out of date almost as soon as it was written.\nLiterary critic Christopher Ricks suggests that the song transcends the political preoccupations of the time in which it was written. Ricks argues that Dylan is still performing the song, and when he sings \"Your sons and your daughter/Are beyond your command\", he sings inescapably with the accents not of a son, no longer perhaps primarily a parent, but with the attitude of a grandfather. Ricks concludes: \"Once upon a time it may have been a matter of urging square people to accept the fact that their children were, you know, hippies. But the capacious urging could then come to mean that ex-hippie parents had better accept that their children look like becoming yuppies. And then Republicans...\"\nCritic Andy Gill points out that the song's lyrics echo lines from the Book of Ecclesiastes which Pete Seeger adapted to create his anthem \"Turn, Turn, Turn!\". The climactic line about the first later being last, likewise, is a direct scriptural reference to Mark 10:31: \"But many that are first shall be last, and the last first.\"\nLess than a month after Dylan recorded the song, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas on November 22nd, 1963. The next night, Dylan opened a concert with his song \"The Times They Are a-Changin\"; he told biographer Anthony Scaduto: \"I thought, 'Wow, how can I open with that song? I'll get rocks thrown at me.' But I had to sing it, my whole concert takes off from there. I know I had no understanding of anything. Something had just gone haywire in the country and they were applauding the song. And I couldn't understand why they were clapping, or why I wrote the song. I couldn't understand anything. For me, it was just insane.\"\nAccording to the The Times They Are A-Changin' Songfacts, handwritten lyrics to four verses of this song jotted on a scrap of paper by Dylan were sold for $422,500 at a December 10, 2010 sale. Hedge fund manager and contemporary art collector Adam Sender placed the winning bid by phone to Sothebys in New York.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/_/The+Times+They+Are+a-Changin%27\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

After Dylan wrote it, he produced a demo in December 1964, which The Byrds' version is based on. Dylan's recording of the song is placed at #106 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.[1] Due to The Byrds' version of the song also making the list at #79, it is one of three songs to place twice, along with \"Walk This Way\" by both Aerosmith and Run-DMC with Perry and Tyler, and \"Blue Suede Shoes\" by both Carl Perkins and Elvis Presley.[2]\n\nTwo earlier recordings by Dylan of the song, one live at New York's Philharmonic Hall dating from October 31, 1964, and one recorded with Ramblin' Jack Elliott on backing vocals during sessions for Another Side of Bob Dylan (also 1964), have recently been given official releases; they are available on The Bootleg Series Vol. 6: Bob Dylan Live 1964, Concert at Philharmonic Hall (2004) and The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home (2005) respectively. Videos of this song with Bob Dylan singing and playing it at the Newport Folk Festival of 1964 can be seen on No Direction Home, a documentary film by Martin Scorsese, and Murray Lerner's The Other Side Of The Mirror.\n\nStructurally, the song is notable for the fact that it begins with an iteration of the chorus, rather than following the conventional pop song structure, which typically employs a brief instrumental introduction that leads into the first verse.\n\nThe song (in its complete version) has invoked many theories about its meaning and theme. Due to the high rating and placement in the top 10 Billboard Top Pop Albums chart, it could be considered one of Dylan's most evocative and poetic songs.\n\nBruce Langhorne, the Greenwich Village folk guitarist, may well have been an inspiration for the song by way of the giant Turkish tambourine-like frame drum he was often known to play in the time leading up to the song's composition;[3][4] he also recorded using the instrument with Richard and Mimi Fari\u00f1a. The electric guitar accompaniment on the album version of \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" is among Langhorne's numerous credits on Bob Dylan's recordings. There are also other influences on the song. Dylan himself has cited Federico Fellini's movie La strada and the words \"in the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you\" are taken from a Lord Buckley recording.[5]\n\nOn the master recording, Dylan is playing an acoustic guitar in dropped D tuning, capoed at the third fret. An electric guitar plays a counter melody to back up Dylan's vocals.\n\nDylan's master recording clocks at 5' 28\" and consists of four verses, while The Byrds' version used only the second verse and was two-and-a-half minutes long.\n\n    * Judy Collins covered the song on her Fifth Album (1965).\n    * Chad and Jeremy covered the song on their fifth album I Don't Want To Lose You Baby (1965).\n    * Kenny Rankin covered the song on his Mind-Dusters album (1967).\n    * Melanie Safka covered the song on her 1969 album Born to Be (aka My First Album).\n    * Gene Clark covered the song on his Firebyrd album (1984).\n    * Gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson requested the song be played at his funeral while his ashes were shot out of a cannon and also dedicated Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas to Dylan because of the song.\n\n    * Neil Aspinall, The Beatles' road manager and personal assistant, also had this song played by Pete Townshend at his funeral.\n\n    * William Shatner covered the song in a spoken-word recitation on his 1968 album, The Transformed Man.\n\n    * Les Fradkin covered the song on his CD \"12\" and as part of the \"Timeless Flyte\" tribute series.\n\n    * Former American Idol contestant Jason Castro covered this song on the show in 2008, forgetting one line of the lyrics. He later mentioned in an interview that, \"Someone told me I Shot the Tambourine Man;\" a reference to him also singing \"I Shot the Sheriff\" by Bob Marley that same week.\n\n    * The song was translated and sung in Russian by Olga Arefieva as Mister Beliy Grib.\n\n    * Genki Sudo translated the song along with ACIDMAN and performed the song on his CD Single, Love and Everything, while keeping 'Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me' in English.\n\n    * M\u00fcsl\u00fcm G\u00fcrses has covered the song with different lyrics written in Turkish. The Turkish version of the song was called Hayat Berbat (Life is Awful).\n\n    * Mr Tambourine Man is used in the closing credits of the Christmas Special episode of the British TV comedy series One Foot in the Grave called 'Starbound'.\n\n    * They Might Be Giants wrote their rare song \"Weep Day\" after seeing this song's title overlapping the end of a line, inspiring the song about two characters named Mr. Tambo and Urine Man. The band has also been known to cover the song live at concerts.\n\n    * In Tom Wolfe's non-fiction novel The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, Mr. Tambourine Man is mentioned numerous times about Dylan's \"raunching and rheuming\".\n\n    * Many indie bands have also covered this song, notably the Cincinnati experimental group Nevada Smith. The Minneapolis band Cloud Cult has also covered the song.\n\n    * It is one of several Dylan songs studied by the students in Dangerous Minds, where it is suggested that the title character is a drug dealer.\n\n    * It was translated into Romanian by Florian Pitti\u015f and sung by Pas\u0103rea Colibri on their 1995 album \"\u00cen c\u0103utarea cuibului pierdut\".\n\n    * In Stephen King's book Carrie the song is mentioned amongst others as the Entretainment portion of the famous Prom Scene alongside 500 Miles, Cabaret and Lemon Tree\n\n    * A famous scene from BBC sitcom One Foot in the Grave sees lead character Victor Meldrew played by Richard Wilson riding a motorised lawn mower whilst [unknowingly] under the influence of drugs singing Hey Mr Tambourine Man. He proceeds to drive into his employers dining room where his employer is in the middle of a meeting with several people including his former neighbour Patrick. He manages to give the carpet a good trim and then drives straight into his employers summer house.\n\n    * In the October, 1992 Bob Dylan 30th anniversary tribute concert at Madison Square Garden, Mr. Tambourine Man was performed by The Byrds' founder Roger McGuinn, backed by Tom Petty, Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench, among others. The tribute used an arrangement similar to The Byrds' 1965 recording, with one additional verse.\n\n    * Bob Sinclar covered the song on his 2009 album titled Born In 69\n\n    * The Barbarians\n\n# ^ \"The Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Songs of All Time #101 through #200\".

In 1966, police arrested Carter for a triple..."}, "description": "Hurricane is a protest song by Bob Dylan co-written with Jacques Levy, about the imprisonment of Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter. It compiles alleged acts of racism and profiling against Carter, which Dylan describes as leading to a false trial and conviction.\n\nDylan's Desire opens with \"Hurricane\", arguably the most popular song on the 1976 release. Named after former middleweight contender Rubin Carter, Dylan had been inspired to write it after reading Carter's autobiography, The Sixteenth Round, which Carter had sent him \"because of his prior commitment to the civil rights struggle.\"\n\nCarter and a man named John Artis had been charged with a triple murder which occurred in the Lafayette Grill, Paterson, New Jersey in 1966. Widely reported as a racially motivated crime, Carter and Artis were found guilty of committing the murders, and both were sentenced to four consecutive life sentences. In the years that followed, a substantial amount of controversy emerged over the case, ranging from allegations of faulty evidence and questionable eyewitness testimony to an unfair trial. In his autobiography, Carter maintained his innocence, and his story eventually led Dylan to visit him in Rahway State Prison in Woodbridge Township, New Jersey.\n\nDylan had written topical ballads before, including, \"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\" and \"The Death of Emmett Till\", but according to Jacques Levy, he wasn't sure that he could write a song.... \"He was just filled with all these feelings about Hurricane. He couldn't make the first step. I think the first step was putting the song in a total storytelling mode. I don't remember whose idea it was to do that. But really, the beginning of the song is like stage directions, like what you would read in a script: 'Pistol shots ring out in a barroom night.... Here comes the story of the Hurricane.' Boom! Titles. You know, Bob loves movies, and he can write these movies that take place in eight to ten minutes, yet seem as full or fuller than regular movies.\"\n\nAfter meeting with Carter in prison and meeting a group of his supporters, Dylan began to write \"Hurricane\" in a \"cinematic\" style. This song was one of Dylan's few protest songs of the 1970s and was his fourth most successful single of the 70s, reaching #33 on the Billboard chart.\n\nDylan was forced to rerecord the song, with altered lyrics, after concerns were raised by Columbia's lawyers that references that Alfred Bello and Arthur Dexter Bradley \"robbed the bodies\" could result in a lawsuit. Neither Bello nor Bradley were ever accused of such acts. Because there was too much leakage on the multitracks to make a vocal \"punch in\", Dylan decided to re-record the entire song. At this time, Dylan was already rehearsing for his upcoming tour, and the musicians from the Rolling Thunder Revue were still at his disposal. Dylan took them back into the studio, and a new, faster version of \"Hurricane\" was recorded again with Don Meehan at the board, with Ronee Blakley providing a harmony vocal. There were no edits in the song that ran over seven minutes. Even though some offending lyrics were rewritten, the song still drew some legal action, from eyewitness Patricia Graham Valentine. Her lawsuit was dismissed by a federal district court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal.\n\nEven with the revised lyrics, \"Hurricane\" still raised controversy; detractors criticized the song for omitting any reference to Carter's criminal history as well as documented evidence of his antagonistic rhetoric and violent temper. There were other inaccuracies, including Carter's description as the \"number one contender\"; according to the May 1966 issue of Ring Magazine, he was ranked no higher than ninth around the time of his arrest. Mike Cleveland of the Herald-News and a number of other critics questioned Dylan's objectivity at the time of the song's release. The Herald-News reporter Cal Deal, who covered Carter's case between 1975 and 1976 and interviewed Carter in August and December of 1975, later accused Dylan of a strong bias towards Carter while employing a significant amount of artistic license. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/_/Hurricane\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The words of the song are sung by Dylan in a low, soft-sounding voice instead of his familiar high-pitched nasal-sounding voice. Dylan credited his \"new\" voice to quitting smoking before recording the song, but some unreleased bootleg tapes from the early '60s reveal that this was an aspect of his vocal persona that he had actually possessed since at least that time.[1] Released as a single in July of 1969, it became one of Dylan's biggest US Pop chart hits, peaking at number seven. The single did even better on the UK Singles Chart, reaching the number five spot. It is often performed live by Dylan, and was included on the Hard Rain and Before the Flood albums. It also appears on his quintuple-platinum Greatest Hits, Volume II album, as well as on compilations Biograph and The Essential Bob Dylan.\n\nThe song was originally written for the soundtrack of the movie Midnight Cowboy, but wasn't submitted in time to make the final cut. [2]\n\nPhil Everly of the Everly Brothers has been quoted that Dylan offered them the song to record in the following way. The Everlys were appearing at the Bottom Line in New York, and after the show, Dylan went backstage to visit with them. Phil asked if Bob had any new songs they might record, and he said yes, there was one they could have. He picked up a guitar and sang, but so quietly that the Everlys could not clearly make out all the words, and thought they heard \"lay lady lay, lay across my big breasts, babe.\" Thinking it was a song about lesbians, Don Everly said \"thank you, it's a great song, but I don't think we could get away with that\", and declined to record it. Dylan did not question them about it and went on to cut the track himself. Months later, they heard Dylan's version on the radio and realized they'd misunderstood the words. The Everlys felt they'd missed a big opportunity and later recorded the song on their album, \"EB 84.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/_/Lay+Lady+Lay\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Brian Jones was known to Dylan and they hung out when Dylan was in London. The relationship was amicable but also tense, ending up in a car chase and car crash (without any casualties) in the middle of the night. Jones used to wear a chinese shirt at the time. Another line states that \"time was on his side\", perhaps referencing a Rolling Stones song from 1964, called 'Time is On My Side'.

NPR's Tim Riley described the song as \"the last word in a long, embittered argument, a paper-thin consolation sung with spite.\"\n\nAs well as the melody, a couple of lines were taken from Clayton's \"Who's Goin' to Buy You Ribbons When I'm Gone?\" which was recorded in 1960, two years before Dylan wrote \"Don't Think Twice.\" Lines taken word-for-word or slightly altered from the Clayton song are, \"T'ain't no use to sit and wonder why, darlin',\" and, \"So I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road.\" On the first release of the song, instead of \"So I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road babe, where I'm bound, I can't tell\" Dylan sings \"So long, honey babe, where I'm bound, I can't tell\". The lyrics were changed when Dylan performed live versions of the song and on cover versions recorded by other artists.\n\nThe original album version of the song is played in a fast, fingerstyle manner by, some speculate, Bruce Langhorne.[1] In live performances, Dylan often strummed the chords, or flatpicks, albeit in a similar, fast-paced manner.\n\nThe song was used to end the last episode of the first season of the television series Mad Men.\n\nCovered by:\n\n Arnaldo Baptista, Cher, Johnny Cash, Davey Graham, Odetta, Rory Gallagher, Stone the Crows, Heinz, Elvis Presley, Burl Ives, Waylon Jennings, Flatt and Scruggs, Steve Young, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Jerry Reed, Joan Baez,  Doc Watson, Peter, Paul and Mary, The Waifs, Vonda Shepard, John Martyn,Metric, Elliott Smith, Billy Bragg, Nick Drake, Sandi Thom, Susan Tedeschi, Emily Haines, Susanna and the Magical Orchestra, Boris Grebenshchikov, Jackie Greene, Bryan Ferry, Wolfgang Ambros, Arlo Guthrie, Tristan Prettyman, Bree Sharp, Gavin Castleton, Donavon Frankenreiter, John Anderson, The Four Seasons, Steel Train, Johnny Marr, Vonda Shepard. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/_/Don%27t+Think+Twice,+It%27s+All+Right\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Lee's bass guitar the only instrumentation.\n\nNote: Dylan's two previous albums, The Times They Are A-Changin' and  Another Side of Bob Dylan both ended with a farewell song, \"Restless Farewell\" and \"It Ain't Me, Babe\" respectively. \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\" concludes  Bringing It All Back Home in consistent fashion. Much speculation has surrounded who and what was the \"Baby Blue\" that Dylan was saying farewell to. Although Dylan himself has remained mute on the subject, Dylan scholars believe that it is probably an amalgam of personalities within Dylan's social orbit. One person who has been regarded as the subject of the song is folk singer Joan Baez.\n\nDylan and Baez were still in a relationship and were planning to tour together, but Dylan had been growing as an artist and as a person and may have already been planning to leave the relationship. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/_/It%27s+All+Over+Now,+Baby+Blue\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song's lyrics have Mr. Jones facing a wild, nonsensical, hallucinatory, carnival-like world, and the character is portrayed as a clueless poser who cannot deal with it all.\n\nThe \"identity\" of Mr. Jones has long been in dispute. When asked about it in an interview in 1965, Dylan responded:\n\n \"He's a pinboy. He also wears suspenders. He's a real person. You know him, but not by that name... I saw him come into the room one night and he looked like a camel. He proceeded to put his eyes in his pocket. I asked this guy who he was and he said, \"That's Mr. Jones.\" Then I asked this cat, \"Doesn't he do anything but put his eyes in his pocket?\" And he told me, \"He puts his nose on the ground.\" It's all there, it's a true story.\"\n\nThe opening lines of the song, \"You walk into the room, with your pencil in your hand,\" appear to lend credence to the notion that \"Mr. Jones\" may have been a journalist. In a mid-1980s interview with Q magazine, Dylan appeared to identify Mr. Jones as Max Jones, a former Melody Maker critic, supporting the theory that \"Mr. Jones\" was simply one of the many music critics who didn't \"get\" Dylan's songs, especially the more allegorical ones he wrote in the mid-1960s.Another theory is that the Jones in question was Jeffrey Owen Jones (later a film professor at Rochester Institute of Technology). As an intern for Time Magazine, Jones had inteviewed Dylan just a day before the musician's legendary performance at the 1965 Newport Jazz Festival.\n\nIn Todd Haynes' 2007 surrealist Dylan biopic, I'm Not There, actor Bruce Greenwood plays \"Keenan Jones\", a journalist who doesn't understand the meaning behind the Dylan-esque character Jude Quinn's songwriting. In the film, Jones is sent through a hallucinatory nightmare sequence while Stephen Malkmus' cover of \"Ballad of a Thin Man\" plays in the background. Greenwood also plays Pat Garrett in the Richard Gere segment of the film.\n\nIt has also been speculated[citation needed] that the song is about Brian Jones, co-founder and guitarist of The Rolling Stones. Dylan was a friend of Jones and watched his lengthy downfall.\n\nApart from all of these possible Dylan-specific references, the term \"Mr. Jones\" is in general broadly understood as an allusion to the phrase \"Keeping up with the Joneses\" \u2014 a reference to the prototypical materialistic American family, so at odds with the outlook on life espoused by Dylan and the counterculture of the 1960s.\n\nAnother possible interpretation of the song is that it is about a man coming to grips with his own homosexuality. Several lyrics appear to reference phallic symbols (\"He hands you a bone\", \"With your pencil in your hand\", \"A one-eyed midget\", \"Sword Swallower\", \"He hands you back your throat\") and there are possible allusions to fellatio (\"Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you / And then he kneels\", \"Here's your throat back, thanks for the loan\" \"Give me some milk or else go home\") and transvestism (\"He clicks his high heels\") as well. In this interpretation of the song, some of the lyrics (\"How does it feel to be such a freak\"; \"There ought to be a law / Against you comin' around\") could allude to society's intolerance of homosexuality.\n\nLyrics\n\nYou walk into the room\nWith your pencil in your hand\nYou see somebody naked\nAnd you say, \"Who is that man?\"\nYou try so hard\nBut you don't understand\nJust what you'll say\nWhen you get home\n\nBecause something is happening here\nBut you don't know what it is\nDo you, Mister Jones?\n\nYou raise up your head\nAnd you ask, \"Is this where it is?\"\nAnd somebody points to you and says\n\"It's his\"\nAnd you say, \"What's mine?\"\nAnd somebody else says, \"Where what is?\"\nAnd you say, \"Oh my God\nAm I here all alone?\"\n\nBecause something is happening here\nBut you don't know what it is\nDo you, Mister Jones?\n\nYou hand in your ticket\nAnd you go watch the geek\nWho immediately walks up to you\nWhen he hears you speak\nAnd says, \"How does it feel\nTo be such a freak?\"\nAnd you say, \"Impossible\"\nAs he hands you a bone\n\nBecause something is happening here\nBut you don't know what it is\nDo you, Mister Jones?\n\nYou have many contacts\nAmong the lumberjacks\nTo get you facts\nWhen someone attacks your imagination\nBut nobody has any respect\nAnyway they already expect you\nTo just give a check\nTo tax-deductible charity organizations\n\nYou've been with the professors\nAnd they've all liked your looks\nWith great lawyers you have\nDiscussed lepers and crooks\nYou've been through all of\nF.

Considered among Dylan's greatest works, Dylan referred to it as his favorite song on the album which captured that \"thin, wild mercury sound\". [2] The song is ranked #404 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nThere have been a number of speculations about the meaning of the song of which none have been supported by statements made by Dylan. Commenting on this song, Marqusee characterises it (p. 196) as 'Dylan's definitive treatment of \"strandedness\"', and notes that 'in contrast to most of the material in \"Blonde on Blonde\", he brought it to the studio as a finished composition'. He later comments 'In VoJ Dylan is stranded between extremes - total freedom and abject slavery.'\n\nOthers have subjected the words to poetic 'close reading' and have found in it a wealth of allusion, for example, to William Blake; thus Thakkar [3] says 'My claims will be these: Louise represents the earthly, the prosaic, the finite; and Johanna represents the pure, the poetic, the infinite'.\n\nThe song was originally titled \"Seems Like a Freeze Out\"; studio recordings from Blonde on Blonde's' early New York sessions, released on bootleg, have a much faster tempo (more similar to Most Likely You'll Go Your Way And I'll Go Mine) and, in the fifth verse, contain the additional line, \"He examines the nightingale's code\". Two slower versions were recorded in New York, one with a march-like tempo (which was released on the No Direction Home soundtrack), and another with a more conventional rock tempo, closer to the album version recorded in Nashville.\n\nTwo live versions of the song recorded during Dylan's 1966 tour of England have been released. One version appeared on Biograph, released in 1985. A second version was recorded at the Manchester Free Trade Hall concert, released as the fourth volume of the Bootleg Series, which was titled The \"Royal Albert Hall\" Concert as a jab at bootleggers who had erroneously referred to the Manchester concert as such for years prior. Many critics and fans have come to regard these stark, evocative live recordings as superior to the album version.\n\nIn Perth, during the Australia tour of 1966, Dylan treated the audience to an otherwise unknown verse of \"Visions of Johanna\". This verse introduces two new characters, Amelia, who describes Australia as \"God's favourite failure\", and \"A Maya with gloves\", who talks about love and chocolate.

It is noted for its length (11:21) and surreal lyrics. It was recorded on August 4, 1965, in Columbia's Studio A in New York City. The two takes spliced for the album were the second and third time Dylan had sung the song. Charlie McCoy played acoustic guitar for the record, making it the album's only track not to feature an electric guitar. An alternate version was also recorded with electric guitar and a prominent bass that was eventually released on The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack. Rolling Stone ranked the song as number 185 in their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Joe Strummer makes a reference to Desolation Row in his song \"Coma Girl\" released on Streetcore. It's also referenced in Laura Branigan's \"Spanish Eddie\" (David Palmer/Chuck Cochran), Atlantic, 1985.\n\nIn the New Oxford Companion to Music, Gammond described \"Desolation Row\" as an example of Dylan's work that achieved a \"high level of poetical lyricism.\"\n\nIn an interview with USA Today on September 10, 2001, the day before the release of his album Love and Theft, Dylan claimed that the song \"is a minstrel song through and through. I saw some ragtag minstrel show in blackface at the carnivals when I was growing up, and it had an effect on me, just as much as seeing the lady with four legs.\"\n\nIt has been suggested that the title is a reference to Jack Kerouac's novel Desolation Angels and John Steinbeck's Cannery Row.  Suggestions over the exact \"location\" of \"Desolation Row\" include Dylan's response to an interviewer on a television press conference on December 3, 1965 that it was \"someplace in Mexico\" and Al Kooper's (who played organ and piano on the album) assertion it was New York City's Eighth Avenue.\n\nMany suggestions have been made as to the different inspirations for the song's lyrics, including the Duluth lynchings (\"They're selling postcards of the hanging... The circus is in town\") and T. S. Eliot's poem The Waste Land\n\nDesolation Row is a counter-culture destination, though more a state of mind than an actual place. The name probably comes from combining Jack Kerouac's novel Desolation Angels and John Steinbeck's Cannery Row.[citation needed]. Kerouac spent the summer of 1956 as a fire lookout on Desolation Peak, and wrote The Dharma Bums and Desolation Angels from his life transforming experiences on the peak. It has also been suggested that T.S. Eliot's poem The Waste Land was an influence on Desolation Row. Musician Al Kooper asserts Desolation Row is in Greenwich Village in New York City, based on personal contact with Dylan.\n\nItalian singer-songwriter Fabrizio de Andr\u00e9 wrote \"Via della Povert\u00e0\", an Italian translation of \"Desolation Row\", and included it in his 1974 album Canzoni. In Norway, \u00c5ge Aleksandersen recorded his version called \"Nederst p\u00e5 Karl Johan\" (on Fredl\u00f8s: Dylan p\u00e5 norsk, 1997).\n\nAccording to the Grateful Dead website, the Dead have performed a cover version of \"Desolation Row\" since the mid-1980s. The song is included on their 2002 release Postcards of the Hanging, which features a recording from March 24, 1990, at the Knickerbocker Arena in Albany, New York. The song was frequently included in Dead set lists and is often abbreviated as \"D-Row.\"\n\nChris Smither recorded the song on his 2003 album Train Home with Bonnie Raitt providing backup on vocals and slide guitar.\n\nDan Tillberg made a Swedish cover version called \"Hoppl\u00f6shetens gr\u00e4nd\" on the \"K\u00e4rlek minus noll\" (\"Love Minus Zero\") cover album.\n\nMy Chemical Romance created a punk rock cover of \"Desolation Row\", for the 2009 soundtrack of Watchmen. The song peaked at #20 on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks in March, 2009. The first chapter of Watchmen (\"At Midnight All the Agents\") is also named in one of the lines of the song, which also includes a quote from the lyrics at the chapter's end.\n\nEdit: The acoustic guitar on Desolation Row is actually played by Chicago born blues guitarist Mike Bloomfield.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/_/Desolation+Row\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Shortly after starting to play he changed his stage name to Bob Dylan, after being influenced by the poetry of Dylan Thomas before legally changing his name in 1962. \n\nMuch of his best known work is from the 1960s, when he became an informal documentarian and reluctant figurehead of American unrest, promoted by Joan Baez. Some of his songs, such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"The Times They Are A-Changin'\", became anthems of the anti-war and civil rights movements, with Joan Baez and Dylan singing together at the March on Washington in 1963. However he later became disenchanted with the and civil liberty protest scene, feeling that he had been used by them.\n\nHis album Bringing It All Back Home marked a move away from the folk scene and a move towards rock and roll and Dylan began to consciously distance himself from his early association with civil rights. He also started to become irritated when being interviewed, often given facetious or irreverent answers to questions. Bringing It All Back Home was a controversial album as it the first on which he played electric guitar. This was seen by some of his fans as a betrayal of this folk roots, with some saying that it obscured his meaningful and poetic lyrics.\n\nThe second half of the 1960s was marked by a string of well received releases, with his song \"Like a Rolling Stone\", released in July of 1965, later being named \"The Greatest Song of All Time\" by Rolling Stone magazine in 2004, placing #1 in a list of 500 titles. It also marked the formation of Dylan's backing band The Hawks (who would later call themselves simply The Band). Dylan embarked on a world tour of Australia and Europe in 1966, during which he seemed to be under a lot of strain and pressure by both his fans, the music press and his own promoters. Dylan himself admitted that he began taking drugs seriously whilst on this tour, and found it immensely hard work. On returning to New York he crashed his motorbike, sustaining serious injuries in the process, and went into a period of withdrawal while he recuperated. During the late 1960s, Dylan again changed stylistic tradition, moving away from the psychedelic culture of the time. It was then that he recorded All Along the Watchtower, perhaps more famously recorded by Jimi Hendrix.\n\nThe 1970s were a period during which Dylan was more sporadic in his output, releasing some poorly received LPs. He rarely appeared in person until 1973, when he began touring again with his backing band The Band. He also wrote one of his most extensively covered songs, Knockin' On Heaven's Door, as well as what is now recognised as one of his best albums Blood On The Tracks. Towards the end of the 1970s, Dylan discovered God, and released some albums of gospel music. He started to talk to the crowd about his faith during his performances, and wouldn't play any of his early work, which alienated some of his previous fans.\n\nDylan today still remains an influential and popular artist; despite a period of little note between 1970-2000, his 2006 album Modern Times reached the US chart at #1, as did his 2009 album Together Through Life, in the US, Britain, France and several other countries. His 2012 album Tempest was also critically acclaimed. Since 1988, Dylan has been on the so-called Never Ending Tour, during which his performanes have provoked controversy, with some critics claiming that his lyrics have become incomprehensible, an experience which is not helped by his tendency to change his set-list and vocals almost every performance.\n\nBob Dylan's strong influence over the past few years is becoming even more prominent amongst a growing group of younger emerging artists such as George Ellias and Devendra Banhart. Dylan's early lyrics incorporated politics, social commentary, philosophy and literary influences, defying existing pop music conventions and appealing widely to the counterculture of the time. While expanding and personalizing musical styles, Dylan has shown steadfast devotion to traditions of American song, from folk and country/blues to rock and roll and rockabilly, to Gaelic balladry, even jazz, swing and Broadway.\n\nDylan performs with the guitar, keyboard and harmonica. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s. He has also recently performed alongside other iconic artists, such as Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell, Tom Petty and Eric Clapton. Although his contributions as a performer and recording artist have been central to his career, his songwriting is generally held as his highest accomplishment.  \n\nNobel Prize for Literature (2016)  - On October 13, 2016, Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for \u201cfor having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition\u201d. The prestigious award has been given annually since 1901 and previous Nobel Laureates for Literature include Harold Pinter and Samuel Beckett.

It was first played on November 16, 2006, on Indianapolis radio station, 93.1, and leaked onto the Internet soon after. It was officially debuted on November 21 at the American Music Awards and was shipped to radio stations that night (with an impact date of December 5 in the United States). This song was #42 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007.\n\nThe song is reportedly about lyricist/bassist Pete Wentz's frustration with the ever growing 'emo scene'. As he told Rolling Stone, \"There may be other songs on the record that would be bigger radio hits, but this one had the right message.\" Wentz got the idea for the arms-dealer metaphor from the Lord of War movie.\n\nThe website that bassist Pete Wentz promotes, FriendsorEnemies.com, made \"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\" available to the internet community on November 17, just after its radio debut in Indianapolis.\n\nThe single was released as a CD single and also as a 7\" blue vinyl and 7\" purple vinyl. There is an official remix featuring Kanye West.\n\nThe song was released as a downloadable track for the video game Rock Band on May 6, 2008. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fall+Out+Boy/_/This+Ain%27t+a+Scene,+It%27s+an+Arms+Race\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was released to iTunes on September 8, 2008.\n\nThe song has been described as a very political track by Patrick Stump, the lead vocalist of the band, but not political in the traditional sense; more about the politics of a relationship. Stump has said that this song is about the superficiality and selfishness that is associated with pop culture. He said the chorus is very catchy and anthemic, yet very vacuous and empty. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fall+Out+Boy/_/I+Don%27t+Care\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

(C) 2007 The Island Def Jam Music Group."}, "description": "The Carpal Tunnel of Love is on the album Infinity On High. It was originally leaked online by the band, and later given to iTunes as a digital download before Infinity on High was released. In addition, a web-exclusive video was released, but later saw televised airplay on Music Choice On-Demand.\n\nThe song title is a combination of carpal tunnel syndrome and the well known \"Tunnel of Love\" ride and this song was featured in the Sony video game, MLB 07: The Show. \n\nMusic video\nOn February 5, 2007, the music video was made available on Fall Out Boy's website. Apart from the characters of Happy Tree Friends, the video also follows a plot where Cuddles and Giggles have fallen in love at first sight, and tells the story of Cuddles' attempts to express his love. However, Lumpy sits between them while they are waiting for the bus. Cuddles spots Toothy, who is cutting flowers in the shape of a heart. Cuddles gets an idea, and pulls off one of the flowers. But there is a bee sitting on that particular flower, and as Cuddles pulls the flower, the bee flies off the flower and stings Toothy in his eye, causing it to swell up and become very large. As the bus (with an acorn printed on the side) arrives, Lumpy sits next to Giggles, and Cuddles is sitting alone. He tries to send a love letter to Giggles, but Lumpy uses it to remove the snot out of his nose and throws it out of the window. The paper gets stuck to Nutty, who drives behind the bus on a motorcycle. He hits a truck filled with iron shafts and dies because one iron shaft goes into his face and comes out the other side. Meanwhile, the bus arrives at some kind of cafe, where Lumpy slams the door behind him when Toothy just wanted to enter. His swollen-up eye gets stuck between the door and is removed from his head, into a tub of ice cream in the cafe. Cuddles and Giggles finally manage to sit next to each other, but when they want to kiss each other, The Mole serves a milkshake between their mouths (Meanwhile, the Fall Out Boy band members enter the cafe). After drinking it for a while, they realize that Toothy's eye is inside. Cuddles and Giggles start throwing up in disgust. Cuddles desperately throws away the slush and spills both drink and eye on the floor, which Lumpy steps on, raises his foot and sees all the mashed-up eyeball on his foot and gets a shock of his life and runs out of the cafe and accidentally kills Toothy by crushing him between the door and the wall. Lumpy finds a breakdown lorry, and steals it, trying to run away. But he accidentally drives it backwards, hitting the cafe. The car's rope gets stuck to the cafe and tightens as Lumpy drives forward, slicing the Mole in two. The car drags the cafe with it, killing all the band members, ripping off their heads. Lumpy also gets stung by a bee in the eye, and loses control about the car. He hits the truck where Nutty died, and manages to stop the car, and thus the cafe. However, the rope is stuck to Lumpy's antler and tightens. Lumpy pushes the accelerator pedal, and sends some of the iron shafts into the air. Cuddles and Giggles, having survived until now, wish to kiss each other, but are both struck by the same iron shaft. While Lumpy's head is ripped off, explosing his spine, Giggles slowly slides down on the shaft to Cuddles. Their mouths touch each other, creating the intention that they kiss each other. In a manner typical of Happy Tree Friends, all the characters in the video including the Fall Out Boy members are killed in a graphic and ultraviolent manner. It was one of the only Happy Tree Friends clips where everyone dies.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fall+Out+Boy/_/The+Carpal+Tunnel+of+Love\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Released in 2006, though the song never reached the popularity that previous singles \"Sugar, We're Goin Down\" and \"Dance, Dance\" achieved, it received moderate playtime on both Pop and Rock stations and peaked at No. 65 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The video also reached No. 1 on TRL on both May 5 and May 8, 2006, being the third consecutive single from the album to reach the top position.\nThe song was originally titled \"A Little Less Molly Ringwald, a Little More Samantha Fox\". Molly Ringwald is an actress who starred in the 1984 movie Sixteen Candles, referenced in the final song title. \"Touch Me\" is a reference to the hit song by Samantha Fox. Fall Out Boy's video for \"A Little Less Sixteen Candles, a Little More \"Touch Me\"\" was nominated for Best Video Inspired by a Film at the First Annual Fuse Fangoria Chainsaw Awards 2006. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fall+Out+Boy/_/A+Little+Less+Sixteen+Candles,+a+Little+More+%22Touch+Me%22\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Stump originally auditioned as a drummer, but soon became the lead singer. The following year, the band debuted with a self-released demo and followed it up with the May 28, 2002 release of Split EP, which featured Project Rocket, on Uprising Records. The group released a mini-LP, Evening Out With Your Girlfriend, also on Uprising Records, in 2003.\n\n2003\u20132004: Independent success\n\nAfter the release of their mini-album, Fall Out Boy built a large cult following playing in the Chicago area and drummer  Andy Hurley, formerly of Racetraitor, joined the band while the two other members left. At this time, Stump also took over rhythm guitar duties. During this time, they played many local shows at the The Knights of Columbus Hall in Arlington Heights, Illinois, also the site of their first video: Dead On Arrival. The same year, after signing to Fueled By Ramen, they released their first full-length album, Take This to Your Grave, on May 6, 2003. The band received an advance from Island Records to record their proper debut, but the advance came with a right of first refusal for Island on Fall Out Boy\u2019s next album. With major financing in place, the recording of Take This to Your Grave took place at producer & Garbage drummer Butch Vig\u2019s Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin, with Sean O\u2019Keefe producing.\n\nWith singles Grand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy and Saturday receiving video airplay on FUSE and mtvU and radio airplay on alternative stations across the country, the band soon gained a cult following. With very positive reviews at the South by Southwest Music Festival and an extensive tour schedule, Fall Out Boy\u2019s popularity continued to grow. The album sold very well and eventually achieved gold status, but only after the success of their next album, From Under The Cork Tree.\n\nIn mid-2003 the band signed with Island Records, part of the super label The Island Def Jam Music Group along with Def Jam Records. This was after they picked up the option for their next album. While recording their mainstream debut, they released the acoustic EP My Heart Will Always Be the B-Side to My Tongue on Fueled by Ramen, May 18, 2004. It debuted at #153 on the Billboard Top 200, their first entry on the chart. The two-disc set included a DVD with videos, more acoustic performances and a fan photo gallery.\n\n2005\u20132006: Commercial debut\n\nOn May 3, 2005, Fall Out Boy released their major label debut, From Under the Cork Tree, which debuted on the Billboard 200 at #9, selling over 68,000 copies in its first week. The album achieved double platinum status and has sold over 2.5 million albums in the US alone. Earlier that year, the band\u2019s stability was threatened when Wentz overdosed on the sedative Ativan in a failed suicide attempt. The track 7 Minutes In Heaven (Atavan Halen) from their album From Under the Cork Tree is based upon Wentz\u2019s attempted suicide.\n\nTheir first single, Sugar We\u2019re Goin\u2019 Down, peaked at #8 on the Billboard Hot 100, #6 on the Pop 100 and #3 on the Modern Rock Charts. The video reached #1 on MTV\u2019s TRL, where it was retired on August 26, 2005. The video also won the MTV2 Award at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, prompting a huge new interest and surge in sales. The band was also nominated for \u201cBest New Artist\u201d at the 2006 Grammy Awards.\n\nThe second single off the album, Dance, Dance, became their second Top 10 Single when it peaked at #9 on the Hot 100. It also reached #6 on the Pop 100 and became the bands top charted hit when it reached #2 on the Modern Rock Charts. The video for the song premiered on TRL on October 11, 2005; it soon reached #1 and was later retired on January 17, 2006. The third single off the album, A Little Less Sixteen Candles, A Little More \u2018Touch Me\u2019, was much less popular than both prior singles but still managed to peak at #65 on the Hot 100 and hit #1 twice on TRL, retiring on June 6, 2006.\n\nThe band headlined the Nintendo Fusion Tour in the fall of 2005, joining The Starting Line, Motion City Soundtrack, Boys Night Out, and Panic! At the Disco on a 31 city tour. Due to their increased success from their MTV Video Music Award, they headlined the Black Clouds and Underdogs Tour\u2014an emo/pop punk event that featured The All-American Rejects, Hawthorne Heights, From First to Last. The tour also featured The Hush Sound for half of the tour and October Fall for half. They played to 53 dates in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.\n\n2007: Continuing prosperity\n\nFall Out Boy\u2019s fourth album, titled  Infinity On High, was released on February 6, 2007. The lead single,  This Ain\u2019t A Scene, It\u2019s An Arms Race, debuted at the 2006 American Music Awards. The video debuted on MTV on Tuesday, December 19, 2006. In the album\u2019s opening week, Infinity on High reached number 1 on the Billboard 200, selling 260,000 copies.\n\n\u201cThis Ain\u2019t a Scene, It\u2019s an Arms Race\u201d peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart on February 4, 2007, making it their most successful song in the UK to date. The single also peaked on the U.S. Hot 100 at number 2 and the U.S. Pop 100 at number 1.  The Carpal Tunnel Of Love (the second single released from the album) reached number 81 on the U.S. Hot 100 by way of digital sales alone. Thnks fr th Mmrs was released on April 9, 2007 and made it to #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at #12 on the UK Singles chart.\n\nFall Out Boy headlined the Honda Civic Tour in 2007 along with +44, The Academy Is\u2026, Paul Wall and Cobra Starship. The tour was originally scheduled to start April 18 and end on June 11. However, due to personal issues, the tour was postponed until May 11, where the first show was played in Denver, Colorado. The tour ended on July 2 in Anaheim, California in the United States and continue on in the United Kingdom.\n\nShowing their versatility, Fall Out Boy has collaborated with rappers Kanye West, Babyface, Jay-Z, and Timbaland and are currently touring with Paul Wall. Babyface produced and Jay Z is featured on Thriller. They also worked with Timbaland on his new album Timbaland Presents Shock Value, where they are featured on the track One and Only, for which Stump and Wentz both contributed in writing. Stump was also featured on two songs with Gym Class Heroes (also signed with Fueled By Ramen), including their #1 Single Cupid\u2019s Chokehold. He also was a guest vocalist on Motion City Soundtrack\u2019s single, Everything Is Alright as well as contributing to If You Could Remember.\n\nThe band played the US portion of the Live Earth concerts on July 7, 2007 at New Jersey\u2019s Giants Stadium, along with AFI, Akon, Alicia Keys, Bon Jovi, Dave Matthews Band, Faith Hill and Tim McGraw, John Mayer, Kanye West, Kelly Clarkson, KT Tunstall, Ludacris, Melissa Etheridge, The Police, Rihanna, Roger Waters, and the reunited Smashing Pumpkins.\n\nThe band toured the world almost constantly in 2007, with gigs throughout the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Europe and Asia.\n\n2008-2009:\n\nOn April 1, 2008, Fall Out Boy released their live album, **** Live in Phoenix. The album was recorded in Pheonix on June 22. It contained a studio recording of Micheal Jackson\u2019s Beat It with John Mayer as a guest on the guitar.\n\nOn the 18th of March, 2008, Fall Out Boy claimed they would play a gig in Antarctica, to be in the Guinness Book of World Records as the only band to have played in each of the 7 continents within 9 months. However, because of weather conditions they were unable to do so, although they did break the record for most interviews on radio in a 24-hour period, setting the bar at 72.\n\nOn December 16th, 2008, Fall Out Boy released their 5th studio album, Folie \u00e0 Deux (literally meaning \u201cmadness shared by two\u201d). The lead single for the album, I Don\u2019t Care was released September 8, 2008.\n\nFall Out Boy star in 2008 comedy film, \u2018Sex Drive\u2019. They make a cameo within the film, playing Fame < Infamy from their album Infinity on High. They also play an acoustic performance of Grand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy. This is due to the friendship executive producer Seth Green has with the band. The song I Don\u2019t Care from their latest album was featured in the end credits. During the credits there is a clip of Ezekiel and Fall Out Boy arguing over the fact that the Amish fixed Fall Out Boy\u2019s tour bus and all that they got in return was \u201ca five song set\u201d alluding to some form of compensation, which serves as a running gag.\n\nOn November 17, 2009, Believers Never Die - Greatest Hits was released, featuring two new songs titled Alpha Dog and From Now On We Are Enemies. Along with the news of the release of the CD we also got some not so great news, Fall Out Boy are currently on a break. \"We're just taking a break and decompressing. We're not putting terms on when we're coming back. We're going to come back when everybody's excited about it and it's fun.\" says Pete Wentz to J14 Magazine.\n\n2010-2012: Hiatus\n\nIn early 2010 the band entered a state of hiatus, with each member eventually going off to explore their own musical interests. Wentz formed DJ duo Black Cards with singer Bebe Rexha in July 2010, releasing an EP before Rexha quietly left the group in January 2012. Trohman and Hurley started the band The Damned Things with Scott Ian from Anthrax and members of Every Time I Die, releasing their debut album Ironiclast in December 2010.\n\nStump recorded his debut solo album Soul Punk which was released on July 26, 2011. Despite gaining generally positive reviews, ticket sales were poor with many Fall Out Boy fans unwilling to follow him in his new musical direction. This negative feedback caused Stump to create his blog entry \"We Liked You Better Fat\" in which he honestly aired his feelings, causing Wentz to reach out to him and ultimately begin collborating again musically in February 2012.\n\n2013-Current: Reunion\n\nDuring 2012, the band reformed and began attempts to reinvent their sound. Sessions were difficult, with early attempts a struggle to produce new material. On February 4, 2013 the band simultaneously announced their reunion, a new single My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up) and the album Save Rock and Roll which was released the following month.\n\nThis announcement was immediately followed by a show that night in Chicago, and another at Webster Hall in New York the next day. Since then the band have been playing headlining arenas, concerts and festivals in America, Europe and Asia. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fall+Out+Boy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

I don't know where my head was at when I heard it, but it really hit me. Josh and I wanted to write a two-minute interlude, just guitar and vocals. It's such a departure from our other songs. When I wrote the lyrics and sang them to the band, we decided to make it into a full song. I've never written lyrics like this before. The first verse is about where I think the fear to be open or vulnerable started. Ever since the first story in Kerrang!, everyone has known about my family issues and domestic whatever, it's something that's kinda stayed with me and I've learned from.

The song was written by Paramore band members Hayley Williams and Josh Farro; Paramore is also credited as being co-producers to the song. The song, recorded in Spring 2009, was the first song to be written for Brand New Eyes.\n\nMusically, \"Ignorance\" is credited as being an alternative rock pop song. Williams' and Farros's inspiration for writing the song was from personal experiences. \"Ignorance\" was generally well received by contemporary music critics. The song was commercially successful, charting within the top thirty in multiple territories, although the song charted better internationally. A music video for \"Ignorance\" was released in August 2009. In the video, the band is shown singing in a room with the only source of lighting being a hanging lightbulb.\n\nBackground\n\n\"Ignorance\" was recorded by American pop rock band Paramore. The song was recorded in Spring 2009. \"Ignorance\" was written by Paramore's band members Hayley Williams and Josh Farro. The song was released as the lead single from the bands 2009 studio album Brand New Eyes in July 2009. \"Ignorance\" was the first song written for Brand New Eyes.[4] In an interview with Kerrang!, Williams, who co-wrote the song, discussed the songs meaning, and her and Farro's inspiration for writing the song, saying,\n\n    \"In my eyes, this song is a huge turning point for the band. The truth of it is, growing up is not easy. We\u2019re five different people who have to work towards the same goal on a daily basis. There were a lot of times when I felt really alone or angry or insecure. I don\u2019t always feel good at confronting people, especially people that I love, like these guys. Sometimes it takes songs to get the point across. The song is from one person\u2019s perspective. It\u2019s unfair that I\u2019m the one who gets to talk about it but it helped me a lot. The line \u2018ignorance is your new best friend\u2019 is about how I felt I was losing people, and I think the band did too. But it\u2019s okay, we\u2019re growing up. I love that song.\"\n\nHayley Williams explained in an interview with The Guardian how this song saved the band from splitting up \"I tried to mumble all the way through,\" she said about the first time she sung the lyrics to her Paramore bandmates. \"But Taylor [York, guitarist] was right next to the speaker and heard every word. He gave me this fierce look \u2013 I thought he was going to kill me \u2013 and said, 'So do you want to tell me about those lyrics?' I ran into the bathroom, I was so nervous. But we talked for two hours and reconciled a lot of tough, heavy things. That song saved our band.\" (Source Ignorance Songfacts).\n\n\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Paramore/_/Ignorance\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

May 9, 2009: \"One line goes, 'The truth never set me free, so I'll do it myself.' We're in a situation where we're still young and it's hard being the ones who are going out and doing something a little different to other people our age. Some friends are going to college and some are at home who are like, I don't know what I'm doing.' It's a case of where people expect things to fall into their lap. You have to take risks to find out what you want.\"\n\nWilliams told Alternative Press the story of this song: \"This was one of the first music demos I got [for Brand New Eyes] from Josh [Farro, guitar]. He recorded the guitars and put some fake drums to it, and I thought it wasn't going to work. Ha! He even wrote the melody for the tag at the end of the chorus - you know, the part where I say 'more' about a billion times. The original lyric was 'Whoa,' of course. (We like 'whoas' a lot.) The chorus came together in about five minutes, only I had no idea what it was about. It was just a bunch of words that came to me. A month later, when I finally got everything together for the verses, it ended up being about how I feel it takes a lot of risk to live fully.\"\n\n(Source Careful songfacts)\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Paramore/_/Careful\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released on March 14, 2013, as the second single from their self-titled fourth album, Paramore. Different from their previous single \"Now\", which showed a darker intensity, \"Still Into You\" derives from genres such as power pop, pop rock and new wave. The song received critical acclaim from music critics, who have praised the pop rock sound, and Hayley Williams' vocals, commending them as \"strong and effective\". Paramore first performed \"Still Into You\" in Austin, Texas, as part of the South by Southwest festival. The song was then released on March 14, 2013 on YouTube following the performance, through a lyric video. The song has the length of three minutes and thirty-six seconds. The lyrical content finds Williams singing about her long time relationship with Chad Gilbert and how her feelings seemingly have stayed the same since their first meeting.\nIn an interview, Hayley Williams was asked if \"Still Into You\" was going to be a love song, to which she replied \"'Still Into You' is definitely a love song. It's definitely happy. But to me anyway \u2014 and obviously I wrote it so maybe I'm biased, but \u2014 it's not a sappy love song. ... We've never done that before, and honestly I don't have a whole lot of experience writing love songs, or anyways lyrics that are like this.\" \"Still Into You\" is a power pop, pop rock and new wave song with Gotye-like skeletal guitar lines, indie-dance glockenspiel and synths. It lacks a heavy guitar riff, which Paramore is typically known for, which is replaced by a back beat on the drums. MTV compared the song to the band The Cars, saying it could pass for one of their B-sides. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Paramore/_/Still+into+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It reached #16 in the UK charts (Depeche Mode would fail to make the Top 10 of the UK singles chart throughout the second half of the 1980s), but hit #2 in West Germany and in South Africa, and was a Top 10 success in several other countries (Sweden, Switzerland, etc.).\n\nThe original version of \"Strangelove\" is a fast-paced poppy track. Though successful, this didn't seem to fit with the Music for the Masses's dark style, so Daniel Miller made a darker slower version of \"Strangelove\" which became the Album Version. It got its own single in the USA called \"Strangelove '88\".\n\n==B-sides==\n\nThere are two B-Sides for \"Strangelove\", both instrumental. \"Pimpf\" is a dark instrumental that's mostly piano, named after the members of one of the Hitler Youth organizations. It is famous for having strange unknown chanting that has caused speculation on what the chanting says. It turns out that the chanting is actually just well-done synths, even though it sounds a lot like Dave and Martin. Piano instrumentals would become more abundant with Depeche Mode for the next 3 years. \"Pimpf\" later shows up as the final track on the vinyl version of Music for the Masses.\n\nThe second instrumental is \"Agent Orange\", named after the herbicide used in the Vietnam War. It is also mostly piano but has an abundance of war-like atmosphere and is considered one of the finest DM instrumentals. At the end of the song, you can hear some morse code. Rumoured to mean \"If anybody can hear this, please help me\", it is actually just gibberish (LAXI \".-.. .- -..- ..\", several times repeated). \"Agent Orange\" later shows up as the first bonus track on the CD/Cassette version of Music for the Masses.\n\n==MUSIC VIDEOS==\n\nThe music video for \"Strangelove\" was directed by Anton Corbijn (co-staring his muse Nassim Khalifa) and appears on the Strange video and The Videos 86>98. It features two models posing in their underwear. In the USA, MTV objected to some of the more revealing footage of the models and the video was edited to replace them with images of the band.\n\nThere was also an Anton-directed video for \"Pimpf\", exclusive to the Strange video, which features David Gahan, Alan Wilder and Andrew Fletcher shouting at each other syncing with the synthetic chanting, while Martin Gore plays the song on a Piano. It is to note that while Martin plays the piano in the video, it is Alan Wilder who plays the piano in all Piano-instrumentals by the band from 1987\u20131990 as well as \"Somebody\".\n\nIn 1988, another video for \"Strangelove\" was released, set to the tune of the album version of \"Strangelove\". It was directed by Martyn Atkins who did photography for earlier DM albums.

It hit the radio in February 2009, and became available for purchase online on February 24, 2009. The single was physically released on April 6, 2009.\n\nThe single officially debuted on February 21, 2009, when the band performed at the Echo Awards in Germany. A video from this performance was the most viewed clip on YouTube for the following two days.\n\n\"Wrong\" has received a positive response on United States alternative rock radio, becoming one of the 30 most-played songs in its first week of release. It has received significant airplay from stations such as KCXX, KXRX, WROX-FM, KROQ, WEQX, XTRA, WWCD, CIMX, CFNY-FM, and KVGS.\n\n\"Wrong\" was added to the BBC Radio 6 \"B-List\" playlist for the week starting 7 March 2009. However, a week after physical release in April 2009, it charted at #24, the lowest UK chart position for the initial single from a Depeche Mode studio album (\"Dreaming of Me\", while charting at #57 in 1981, was not an \"official\" track from the Speak & Spell album). By contrast, Sounds of the Universe itself reached #2 in the UK upon release in late April, Depeche Mode's highest album chart position there since 1997. \"Wrong\" went to #1 on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart in the Spring of 2009.\n\nThe B-side \"Oh Well\" (which also appears on the Sounds of the Universe deluxe box set edition) is the first collaboration between Martin Gore (music) and Dave Gahan (lyrics).\n\nThe music video for \"Wrong\" was filmed in December 2008 and directed by Patrick Daughters. It debuted on the band's MySpace page on February 20, 2009. The video depicts a Ford Crown Victoria rolling backwards down a Los Angeles downtown street, seemingly with no driver at the wheel. A shot inside the car reveals a man in a latex mask lying unconscious in the front seat. When the car bumps another car (but keeps rolling), the man is jolted awake. As he tries in desperation to stop the car, it becomes apparent that he is bound and gagged. The car rolls past the band (watching from a sidewalk) and hits a pedestrian, trash cans, and traffic cones. A police vehicle begins pursuing the car. When the man finally manages to free his wrists and remove the mask, a white pickup truck crashes into the side of the car, bringing it to a halt. The bound man in the driving seat, the disturbing latex mask, the crash with a large white vehicle and the overall violent mood evoke parallels to similar elements in the film Surveillance. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Depeche+Mode/_/Wrong\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was the first in a long line of industrial-inspired singles released by the band, and has been referred to as \"arguably...the first English-language industrial pop hit.\" The single was re-released (in live format) on 13 February 1989 (25 March 1989 in the US) to support the live album 101.\n\nBackground and themes\n\nIn January 1983, shortly before the release of the \"Get the Balance Right!\" single, lyricist Martin Gore attended an Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten concert, giving him the idea to experiment with the sounds of industrial music in the context of pop. This experimentation hinged on the band's first use of a Synclavier, a synthesizer that not only contained a large number of pre-programmed sounds, but also allowed for samples to be imported. With this, the band proceeded to travel around the neighbourhood where they could tape \"found\" sounds and feed them into the Synclavier, then manipulate the noises to fit into their songs. These sounds consisted mainly of hammering anvils, clanging pipes, running water, and the like. In addition to the \"found\" sounds used as samples, the single also samples a variety of musical instruments, such as the xylophone and a melodica (which Martin has been known to play on stage for the song). That spring, the band converged in London to begin recording their third album, Construction Time Again, and changed recording studios as well. For the previous two albums, the band had recorded at Blackwing Studios, but would switch to John Foxx's \"The Garden\" studio. This change, along with the addition of Gareth Jones to the production team facilitated the band's transition from the hook driven pop songs of their past (a transition that had begun to take shape in 1982 with the more noticeably melancholy \"Leave in Silence\"). The band continued perfecting their industrial formula over their next two albums, 1984's Some Great Reward and 1986's Black Celebration.\n\nIn addition to the change in the band's musical influence, the single would introduce a transition in lyrical content as well. Construction Time Again would include a bevy of political themes, sparked by the poverty Gore had seen on a recent trip he had taken to Thailand. These themes were in stark contrast from the inoffensive, love-themed pop numbers of the band's early career. \"Everything Counts\", specifically addresses corporate greed and corruption in the music industry, as the chorus sings of \"grabbing hands\" that \"grab all they can\". Perhaps surprisingly, the single was released at a time when the band itself was not under a formal contract with Mute Records.\n\nIt was also the first song in the band's catalogue which includes both of the band's singers prominently (at different times). Lead vocalist David Gahan sings the verses, while song writer Martin Gore sings the chorus.\n\n\nLive performances and re-release\n\nThe song would quickly catch on as a fan favorite at the band's concerts, and was used as the opening song for the Construction Time Again tour.  The first live version of the song to appear on a commercial release came from the Some Great Reward tour in 1984, when a recording from a show in Liverpool appeared on the double A-sided \"Blasphemous Rumours/Somebody\" single. During the Music for the Masses tour, the band used \"Everything Counts\" as the final encore and in 1989, the song would be re-released as a single in live form, to promote the live album 101. All live tracks from the release were recorded on 18 June 1988 at the Pasadena Rose Bowl during the final performance of the aforementioned Music for the Masses tour. This version of the song is famous for the recording of the crowd continuing to sing the chorus long after the music had stopped.\n\nIt also appears in Devotional as the closer. It was played during the first two legs of Touring the Angel in the first encore, and also appears on the Touring the Angel: Live in Milan-DVD.\n\nEverything Counts was also remixed and re-released in 2006. Everything Counts - Oliver Huntemann & Stephan Bodzin Dub features on the limitied edition release of the single Martyr. There\u00b4s also a unreleased Oliver Huntemann & Stephan Bodzin remix that floats on the internet, which contains more vocal parts from the original version.\n\n\nMusic videos\n\nThe music video for \"Everything Counts\" was directed by Clive Richardson in and around Berlin. The band returned to Richardson after not being satisfied with the work of Julien Temple for the A Broken Frame singles. Richardson had previously directed the video to \"Just Can't Get Enough\" two years earlier. According to Wilder, \"It was felt that after the Julien Temple years, we needed to harden up not only our sound but also our image. Clive had lots of new ideas which didn't involve stupid storyboards where we were required to act.\"  In the original music video, the xylophone, the melodica, and the shawm are played by Alan Wilder, Martin Gore, and Andrew Fletcher, respectively. The shawm, however, is produced by a synthesizer on the studio recording, but the band used the real shawm in the music video and television performances for show.\n\nThe \"Everything Counts (Live)\" video was directed by D.A. Pennebaker. The video not only includes portions of the live performance, but also contains various references to the money made from merchandise and ticket sales at the concert, humorously connected to the theme of corruption and greed of the song.\n\n\nB-side\n\nThe original release's B-side \"Work Hard\" is notable in that it is the first Depeche Mode song (excluding instrumentals) that is credited to both Martin Gore and Alan Wilder (the only other case of this is 1986's \"Black Day\", an alternate version of \"Black Celebration,\" credited to Gore, Wilder, and Daniel Miller).\n\nThe B-side of the live re-release is a live recording of \"Nothing\", a track from Music for the Masses. The 12\" release also includes live recordings of \"Sacred\" and \"A Question of Lust\".\n\n\nSong versions\n[edit] Remixes of \"Everything Counts\"\n\nOn the original release, there was only one remix available. The 12\" version of the single is called \"Everything Counts (In Larger Amounts)\", although sometimes (such as on the US release of Construction Time Again) it is referred to simply as the \"Long Version\".\n\nThe live re-release of the single, however, contains a plethora of mixes, from a variety of remixers, despite the fact that the standard 7\" and 12\" versions contained no remixes. This release is first Depeche Mode single to be released in a 10\" vinyl format; the A-side of the 10\" inch version is the \"Absolut Mix\", remixed by Alan Moulder (certain versions refer to this mix as the \"Alan Moulder Mix\"). The B-side included the original release's 12\" version as well as the \"Reprise\", a 55-second reprisal of the song's chorus originally placed following the final track (\"And Then...\") on the Construction Time Again album. Specifically, it is the ending of \"Everything Counts (In Larger Amounts)\" with the beat removed.\n\nThe limited edition 12\" version is the \"Bomb the Bass Mix\", remixed by Tim Simenon and Mark Saunders. Simenon would eventually be used by the band as a producer, for the 1997 album Ultra.\n[edit] B-side remixes\n\nA variety of mixes of other songs would appear on these single releases as well. On the 1983 release, the 12\" B-side contains an extended version of \"Work Hard\" titled the \"East End Remix\".\n\nTwo remixes of \"Nothing\" appear on the 1989 release as well, including the \"Remix Edit\" (sometimes referred to as the \"US 7\" Mix\" as it was the 7\" B-side to the US-only single \"Strangelove '88\") and the \"Zip Hop Mix\" by Justin Strauss.\n\nA remix of \"Strangelove\" also appeared on the B-side of the limited edition 12\" vinyl, referred to as the \"Highjack Mix\" by Tim Simenon and Mark Saunders, who also mixed the A-side.\n\n\nCovers\n\nMelodic Death Metal band In Flames covered this song on their 1997 album Whoracle. German band Cinema Bizarre sampled this song in their song Escape to the Stars <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Depeche+Mode/_/Everything+Counts\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song reached #14 on the UK singles chart and matched the success of previous single \"I Feel You\" on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, where it hit #1.\n\nThe 7\" version of \"Walking in My Shoes\" is not the same as the one in the Songs of Faith and Devotion album. The sound has been made more noisy and dirty, especially the drums in the verse, and the intro has been shortened.\n\nThe B-side is \"My Joy\", the only exclusive B-Side from the Songs of Faith and Devotion album, and is a rock track in the vein of \"I Feel You\" and \"Halo\".\n\nThe music video for \"Walking in My Shoes\" was directed by Anton Corbijn and is based on Dante's Divine Comedy[citation needed]. At the beginning of the second verse, there's a shot of Martin Gore, Andrew Fletcher, and Alan Wilder with naked women on their laps. This was removed in the MTV version in the US and replaced with footage the three members standing still, alone, from earlier in the video. The uncut version is on The Videos 86-98, the Devotional and The Best Of, Volume 1 DVDs. The song was covered by Canadian Grunge Band, Finger Eleven and was placed on their 2000 album The Greyest of Blue Skies.\n\nThe song is covered live by Janus. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Depeche+Mode/_/Walking+in+My+Shoes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was the first single from the album Black Celebration, and the band's thirteenth overall and sixth consecutive single to hit the UK Top 20, peaking at #15. \"Stripped\" is well known for its innovative use of sampling. The underlying beat is a distorted and slowed-down sound of a motorcycle engine running, while the main melody begins with a car's ignition starting, and the end uses sounds of fireworks.\n\nThe band's U.S. label Sire Records, however, decided to use the B-side \"But Not Tonight\" in the soundtrack to the movie Modern Girls and included the song on US editions of Black Celebration. As a result, the single was flipped, and released as \"But Not Tonight\" in the United States. The single did not chart. The band was not happy with this decision, seeing \"But Not Tonight\" as a useless poppy track recorded in less than a day.\n\nThe other two B-Sides are \"Breathing in Fumes\" and \"Black Day\". \"Breathing in Fumes\" is a new song using samples from \"Stripped\", mixed by the band and Thomas Stiehler. \"Black Day\" is an acoustic version of \"Black Celebration\" sung by Martin Gore, and is co-written by him, Alan Wilder, and Daniel Miller (The only Depeche Mode song with Daniel Miller as writer).\n\nThe \"Highland Mix\" of \"Stripped\" was mixed by Mark Ellis (better known as Flood), who in the future would produce Depeche Mode's Violator and Songs of Faith and Devotion records. UK Editions of the Black Celebration CD include the extended remix of \"But Not Tonight\" along with \"Black Day\", and \"Breathing in Fumes\" as bonus tracks.\n\nThe music video for \"Stripped\" was the last Depeche Mode video to be directed by Peter Care and was filmed outside of Hansa Studios. The music video for \"But Not Tonight\" was directed by Tamra Davis and is available in multiple versions. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Depeche+Mode/_/Stripped\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They are one of the most enduring and successful bands to have emerged during the 80s, and particularly from the new wave/new romantic era. The band name is derived from a French fashion magazine, D\u00e9p\u00eache mode, which means  \"fashion dispatch.\"\n\nThe band have been highly influential in the electronic dance music scene, especially synthpop, techno and trance, in part due to their innovative work, recording techniques and use of sampling. Their most successful album is arguably 1990's Violator, which reached the #2 position in the UK, #7 in the US, and sold over 8 million copies worldwide. The band has released a long series of high-charting singles over their three-decades long career. Enjoy the Silence is their most recognized song and is one of the most covered songs in history. \n\nThe original line-up was Dave Gahan, Martin L. Gore, Andy Fletcher and Vince Clarke. In December 1981, Clarke left the band and later went on to form Yazoo, The Assembly and Erasure. Alan Wilder joined the group initially in January 1982 as a live keyboardist but became an official member in December 1982. He left mid-1995 to fully concentrate on his Recoil project and the band continued as a trio. In 2010 Wilder re-joined Depeche Mode on stage after 16 years, for a performance of Somebody during a show at London's Royal Albert Hall in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust.\n\nDepeche Mode's origins date back to 1977, when Vince Clarke and Andrew Fletcher formed a band called No Romance in China, with Clarke on vocals and guitar and Fletcher on bass. In March 1980, Clarke, Gore and Fletcher formed a band called Composition of Sound, with Clarke on vocals/guitar, Gore on keyboards and Fletcher on bass. Soon after the formation of Composition of Sound, Clarke and Fletcher switched to synthesizers. Dave Gahan joined the band in 1980 after Clarke heard him perform at a local scout hut jam session, singing to a rendition of David Bowie's \"Heroes\", and Depeche Mode were born. \n\nWhile playing a live gig at the Bridge House in Canning Town, the band were approached by Daniel Miller, the founder of Mute Records, who proposed them a verbal contract. The result was their first single Dreaming of Me, recorded in December 1980 and released in February 1981, reaching number 57 in the UK charts and followed soon by a real contract with Mute.\n\nTo date, Depeche Mode have released:\n14 studio albums: Speak & Spell (1981), A Broken Frame (1982), Construction Time Again (1983), Some Great Reward (1984), Black Celebration (1986), Music For the Masses (1987), Violator (1990), Songs of Faith and Devotion (1993), Ultra (1997), Exciter (2001), Playing the Angel (2005),  Sounds of the Universe (2009), Delta Machine (2013) and Spirit (2017);\n8 compilations: People Are People (1984), The Singles 81-85 (1985), Catching Up with Depeche Mode (1985), Greatest Hits (1987), The Singles 86>98 (1998), Remixes 81-04 (2004), The Best Of Depeche Mode Volume 1 (2006), The Complete Depeche Mode (2006);\n5 live albums: 101 (1989), Songs of Faith and Devotion Live (1993), Recording the Angel (a series of live recordings; 2006), Tour Of The Universe: Barcelona 20/21:11:09 (2009) and Live In Berlin (Soundtrack) (2014) ;\nOver 50 singles:  including Just Can't Get Enough, Everything Counts, People Are People, Master and Servant, Shake the Disease, Stripped, A Question of Time, Strangelove, Never Let Me Down Again, Personal Jesus, Enjoy the Silence, World in My Eyes, Policy of Truth, I Feel You, Walking in My Shoes, In Your Room, Barrel of a Gun, It's No Good, Home, Dream On, Freelove, Precious, Wrong and Heaven ;\n14 live / video collections (VHS/DVD/Blu-ray): The World We Live In and Live in Hamburg (1985), Some Great Videos (1985), Strange (1988), 101 (1989), Strange Too (1990), Devotional (1993), The Videos 86>98 (1998), One Night in Paris (2002), The Videos 86>98 (2002), Touring the Angel: Live in Milan (2006), The Best of - Volume 1 (2006), Tour of the Universe : Barcelona 20/21.11.09 (2009), Live in Berlin (2014) and Video Singles Collection (2016)  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Depeche+Mode\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In this instance, it's inversely proportional to Matt Berninger's lyrics, which are often loopy and complex and even more averse to a straight reading than usual here. He lays out the conflict in fairly legible terms-- \"I have only two emotions/ Careful fear and dead devotion/ I can't get the balance right\"-- and the results are an immeasurable number of unstable, incomprehensible feelings. \nAt best, Beringer can only allay his confusion by managing a grim joke about canonical artists whose albums convey timeless truths: \"if you want to see me cry/play Let It Be or Nevermind.\" Which becomes another joke on top of itself-- since when did those guys ever have their shit together? So for all its multitudes, \"Don't Swallow The Cap\" comforts by commiserating right along if you're not sure what you're feeling, but you know it's not quite right. In other words, it's a National song.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+National/_/Don%27t+Swallow+the+Cap\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band, whose sound has been described as \u201c\u2026a stagecoach in overdrive\u201d, has brought their eclectic blend of punk, bluegrass, and dixieland to packed bars, basements, and festivals across the US since their inception in the spring of 2007. With a lineup of great musicians, the band\u2019s live show is never the same twice. Brothers Jarrod and Zachary Starling provide acoustic guitar and drums/washboard; along with Dallin Bulkley on standup bass to round out the rhythm section. Garrett Briggeman adds to the energy with 5-string banjo, while Josue Estrada&#39;s trumpet provides layers of jazz and Western to the sound. Tyler Grubb holds down double solo duties, playing both mandolin and trombone. This blend of influences and instrumentation ensures a unique and interesting show each night. CNS plays hundreds of dates a year hitting 47 states and 5 countries. The band has built a dedicated following with their energetic live show and ability to fit on the bill with acts ranging from bluegrass to rockabilly; punk to ska. Breakneck mandolin solos melt into blaring trombone and trumpet lines, while the standup bass and feed-bucket-trap-set churn out driving rhythms that carry the force of a Kansas freight train. Thoughtful songwriting that explores deeper, more interesting themes is what sets this band apart from the multitudes of acts content with singing about Whiskey and Women. From social satire to labor union songs to Civil War Ballads to existential journeys that explore life, death, despair, and indulgence, CNS\u2019s songs will provoke thought, incite riots, and lure your children into a life of travel and debauchery. With 2 original LP&#39;s (2010 Self-Titled, 2013 Hatchetations) and 1 split EP ( 2012 Liberty, Solidarity, Responsibility w/ Cletus Got Shot), CNS has built a repertoire of original songs that continue morph with the progression of the band. Another 2017 full-length is on the horizon that will prove to highlight the band&#39;s musical growth, and maturity of writing. The band\u2019s DIY mentality is shown through their self-recorded albums, self-published music, self-booked tours, and a community of local and regional visual artists that show the band\u2019s distinctly grassroots approach. CNS has been pounding the highways and byways of this great country for 8 years now, bringing their songs and stories to thousands. Always providing a high energy, drink\u2019em down atmosphere to any place they play, CNS has proven a dedication to their live shows with a solid understanding of what entertainment really means.

The band's lyrics are written and sung by Matt Berninger in a distinctive, deep baritone. The rest of the band is composed of two pairs of brothers: Aaron Dessner (guitar, bass, keyboards), Bryce Dessner (guitar), Scott Devendorf (bass, guitar) and Bryan Devendorf (drums). \n\nTheir self-titled debut album\"The National\" (Brassland 2001) was recorded and released before they had played even a single show. They cut the album with engineer Nick Lloyd and formed a label with writer Alec Bemis, so those recordings could be released. Kerrang! magazine gave it four Ks, calling it \"the stuff underground legends are made of.\"\n\nThe National made a second album, \"Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers\" (Brassland/Talitres 2003). The staff was the same, though Peter Katis, who produced \"Turn on The Bright Lights\" and \"Antics\" by Interpol, helped produce and mix, and Australian composer Padma Newsome from Clogs collaborated on arrangements and strings.\n\nFollowing the first session of several for Bernard Lenoir on France's Radio Inter, an in-between EP was released, Cherry Tree, containing what would become the blueprint for the sound on their next record and the session of Sad Song's standout Murder Me Rachael. After these accolades and being impressed by their live show, Roger Trust signed them to Beggars Banquet.\n\nA show at their favorite bar became a van ride to neighboring cities, became a plane ride to Europe, became two summers overseas. Their ties to those good jobs slackened. And they continue on their own path, moving out even further out in Brooklyn to Ditmas Park, where there is space and familiar suburban streets and even Geese on Beverly Road. Their album, \"Alligator\", much of which was recorded at their homes in Ditmas Park, was engineered by Paul Mahajan, who has worked with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and TV on the Radio. Padma Newsome camped out for a month with the band, and Peter Katis added more production and mixed the record at his house in Bridgeport, Connecticut.\n\nBerninger's potent baritone still intones about matters fraught and funny and sad; about record collections, missing persons and medium-sized American hearts. But the record's not simply gothic or miserablist -- more like the plays of Tennessee Williams, it's full of peculiar intimacies and awkward grace. Alligator's heroes are reckless and possessed seducers, but they are apologetic ones. In The National's imaginings, in songs alternately lush and spare, there is something twighlit and dreamy worked out in the basement of our brains.\n\n\"Abel,\" \"Secret Meeting,\" and \"Lit Up\" were released as singles.\n\nOn May 22, 2007, The National released their follow-up to Alligator, Boxer, on Beggars Banquet. Taking advantage of the fact that nobody had heard their first album and earliest demos, Matt proceeded to steal lyrics and melodies from them and give them the attention they deserved while keeping the intimacy that made them special. They even managed to convince new friend Sufjan Stevens to lay down some piano tracks for them, and recorded the album in a scant 6 months after coming off the long post-Alligator road.\n\n\"Mistaken for Strangers\", \"Fake Empire\" and \"Apartment Story\" have been released as singles. The band have just finished touring North America and are on a large European autumn/winter tour after playing high slots at several large festivals. In their Dec. 07/Jan. 08 issue, Paste magazine named Boxer best record of 2007.\n\nThe band's fifth album, High Violet, was released on May 10, 2010 by 4AD Records. \"Bloodbuzz Ohio\", \"Anyone's Ghost\" and \"Terrible Love\" were released as singles.\n\nIn 2013 their sixth studio record Trouble Will Find Me was released and named \"Best New Music\" by Pitchfork. The album contained the single \"I Need My Girl\". In 2015, the album outtake \"Sunshine On My Back\"  was released.\n\nFour years after Trouble Will Find Me, marking the longest timespan between albums in their career so far, they released their seventh album Sleep Well Beast on September 8th, 2017 and were yet again met with great critical success.\n\nThe National homepage: http://www.americanmary.com/\nThe National blog http://tntl.tumblr.com\nThe National on Twitter http://twitter.com/The_National\nBrassland homepage: http://brassland.org/\nBeggars Banquet homepage: http://www.beggars.com/ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+National\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was originally featured on their 1986 album The Queen Is Dead, but despite its popularity it was not released as a single until 1992, after The Smiths split up. Morrissey re-released the song as a double A-side live single (with his cover of Patti Smith's Redondo Beach) in 2005, which reached #11 in the UK singles chart. The song has been voted highly in numerous \"best ever\" song lists.\n\nThe song lyrically utilises a first-person narrative concerning yearning, anxiety, and implied romance. Morrissey assumes the role of a person who has, one could infer from the lyrics, been kicked out of home, so seeks solace and company in the form of the person the song addresses - the car's driver.\n\nMusically, the song begins with a staccato bridge similar to that heard on Hitch Hike by Marvin Gaye and There She Goes Again by The Velvet Underground, which recurs as a musical motif throughout the song. With synthesized strings, a balladesque arrangement and yearning lyrics, many listeners have viewed \"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\" as a straightforward love song despite some ambiguity in the lyrics themselves.\n\nLyrics\nMany of Morrissey's lyrics are borrowed from other sources. In particular, the title of this song has been a source of wonder. One credible suggestion has been that the title is a paraphrase of what Hugh Latimer said to Nicholas Ridley as they were about to be burned at the stake as heretics during the reign of \"Bloody Mary,\" Queen Mary I of England:\nPlay the man, Master Ridley; we shall this day light such a candle, by God's grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out.\nSimon Goddard argues in his book Songs That Saved Your Life that the basic narrative story is similar to that of the James Dean film Rebel Without a Cause, in which Dean - an idol of Morrissey's - leaves his torturous home life, being the passenger to a potential romantic partner. Given Morrissey's previous thematic and lyrical borrowings from literature and cinema, this is a viewpoint with some plausibility. According to Goddard, an earlier version lacked some of the finished version's ambiguity, culminating in the line \"There is a light in your eyes and it never goes out\". Additionally, the video for Morrissey's song Suedehead shows him visiting Dean's childhood home, and at one point displays the words \"There is a light that never goes out.\"\n\nRelease and Versions\n\"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\" was originally planned to be a single from The Queen is Dead, but Rough Trade Records label boss Geoff Travis selected Bigmouth Strikes Again from the same album as the release instead. The song has subsequently been covered by a number of artists, including UK singer David Ford, Anberlin, Neuroticfish, Braid, Eurythmics, Noel Gallagher of Oasis, The Magic Numbers, The Divine Comedy, Neil Finn, Walleye (on the tribute album The World Still Won't Listen), Nada Surf, The Ocean Blue, Ghost Mice and Schneider TM (their version of the song is known as The Light 3000).

Johnny Marr described it as \u201cpossibly our most enduring record. It\u2019s most people\u2019s favourite, I think\u201d, however, it is not generally considered to be representative of the band\u2019s style. \n\nOriginally a B-side with \"Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want\" on the 12\u201d single version of \u201cWilliam, It Was Really Nothing\u201d in 1984, the song was subsequently featured on the compilation album Hatful of Hollow and on US., Australian and Warner UK editions of Meat Is Murder. It was belatedly released as an A-side in the United Kingdom in 1985, reaching #24 on the singles chart.\n\nAlthough a club favourite, \u201cHow Soon Is Now?\u201d did not chart as well as writers Morrissey and Marr had expected. Most commentators put this down to the fact that the song had been out on vinyl in a number of forms before being released as a single in its own right. The original track ran for nearly 7 minutes; however, the 7\u201d single edit cut the length down to under four minutes. The complete version is generally used on compilations. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths/_/How+Soon+Is+Now%3F\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It appears on their third album The Queen Is Dead and was the lead single from the album, reaching #26 in the UK Singles Chart in 1986. It was also the closing song on The Smiths' only live album, Rank.\nSince the breakup of The Smiths, Morrissey has performed this song live in 2004, including it on his Live at Earls Court (2005). Johnny Marr sang and played it in a Later With Jools Holland TV broadcast (June 2013).\nThe lyrics describe the protagonist's frustration of being hounded by others for his comments, to which he replies \"I was only joking\".\nDuring the song, the protagonist compares himself to Joan of Arc as the flames rose to her Roman nose.[2] The proceeding line, \"and her Walkman started to melt'\", is often changed by Morrissey in live performances, to the more technologically-current \"and her iPod started to melt\".[3]\nThe high-pitched voice in the background is actually Morrissey's voice altered to a higher pitch. The backing vocal is credited to \"Ann Coates\", a reference to the Manchester district of Ancoats. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths/_/Bigmouth+Strikes+Again\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song is notable for marking the beginning of producer Stephen Street's working relationship with the band. As one of his first roles as \"in-house engineer\" at Island Records' Fallout Shelter studios, Street engineered the session. He was well aware of the band and excited by the prospect, saying in a HitQuarters interview, \"I\u2019d seen them just shortly beforehand on Top Of The Pops doing \u2018This Charming Man\u2019, and like most other people around that time who were into music I was really excited by them.\" Street says his enthusiasm must have rubbed off on Morrissey and Johnny Marr because they would take his name and number. Although not contacted for the subsequent recording \"William, It Was Really Nothing\", he was asked to engineer their next album, Meat Is Murder, with Morrissey and Marr producing for the first time. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths/_/Heaven+Knows+I%27m+Miserable+Now\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released as a single in August 1987, reaching #13 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nIt was the first of three singles from the band's last studio album Strangeways, Here We Come. As such, it was the last single to include newly recorded material on the b-side. It holds the distinction of containing the last recorded Smiths song, I Keep Mine Hidden. Also included \u2013 and recorded at the same session \u2013 was a cover version of a Cilla Black song, Work Is a Four-Letter Word. Morrissey's insistence on recording this song incurred the wrath of Johnny Marr who left the band not long afterwards.\n\nThe single itself is a tongue-in-cheek, music hall inflected song that clocks in at a mere two minutes and two seconds. Although seemingly lightweight and catchy, the song features acidic, ambiguous lyrics. The song also contains peak guitar work by Johnny Marr. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths/_/Girlfriend+in+a+Coma\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It first appeared on their album Meat Is Murder, and was released as their eighth single. It was composed by guitarist Johnny Marr and singer/songwriter Morrissey.\n\nA unique single, it was the second-lowest charting Smiths single, reaching only #49. The repetition and sad tone conveyed are unusual for a Smiths single. This has raised suspicions that the song is about a journalist with whom Morrissey had a relationship. According to Dave Simpson in his Uncut article (August 1998), the unnamed journalist steadfastly refuses to discuss Morrissey to this day. \n\nThe song is about a car ride where the narrator's partner makes a mocking statement about those who are suicidal and lonely (\"when you laugh about people who feel so very lonely / their only desire is to die\").

He plays with figurative and literal meanings \u2013 notably in the line \"I drove the point home\" \u2013 which refers both to the literal \"return home\" in the car and the insistence with which he makes his point in response to the joke. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths/_/That+Joke+Isn%27t+Funny+Anymore\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It features on the compilation albums The World Won't Listen and Louder Than Bombs, and originally appeared as the B-side to the boy with the thorn in his side. The song, one of the band's bleakest, features mostly piano; the melody was something Johnny Marr had been toying around with for years, originally composed (in simpler form) as a coda to suffer little children. The song was recorded the same day as rubber ring, when Marr announced that he had \"a little piano thing\" he wanted \"to put down with Morrissey.\"\n\nIt remains a fan-favourite, although it was only performed live once by the group (at Eden Court, Inverness, on 1 October 1985, the last date of the '85 Scotland tour), after a piano, which couldn't be moved, was discovered on the wings of the stage during the sound check. Morrissey was apparently in a fetal position in the center of the stage by the end of the song.\n\nThe song ends with a music box playing \"Auld Lang Syne\".\n\nIt has been covered by Stars and can be found on Sing Me to Sleep: Indie Lullabies. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths/_/Asleep\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

With sold-out national tours, a social media following of more than 6.5 million, and YouTube views exceeding 100 million, Granger Smith has amassed a rabid audience, while building a truly groundbreaking career.

The album, produced by Granger Smith and Frank Rogers, features the hit single Backroad Song, which landed the No. 1 spot at country radio (Billboard Country Airplay, Mediabase and Music Row charts).

And it&#39;s one he is determined to repay with his 10th album, While the Gettin&#39; Is Good. The project, released on Sugar Hill Records, marks the first time that the singer-songwriter, a wildly popular touring artist who has produced all of his past efforts, has turned over the reins to a bona fide country music producer in Keith Stegall. The result is Smith&#39;s most ambitious record yet, as well as a return on the investment made by the fans who have supported him since his first album in 2003.&quot;A lot of start-up acts are using fan-funded programs to finance their record. That&#39;s what my whole career has been: Kickstarter before Kickstarter. When my fans show up and buy a ticket and a t-shirt, they&#39;re investing in what I&#39;m doing,&quot; says Corey. &quot;It&#39;s my responsibility to invest it wisely and give them the best album I can. That&#39;s what led me to While the Gettin&#39; Is Good.&quot;It&#39;s also what led him to Stegall, who has produced such radio heavyweights as Alan Jackson and Zac Brown Band. It was the producer&#39;s track record, country-music experience and easy-going nature that convinced Corey that he was the man to refine his signature acoustic sound. &quot;Keith knows how to make country records,&quot; he says, &quot;but I wanted to make my kind of country record and he understood that immediately. He simply wanted to get us comfortable in a studio environment so we could do what we do onstage every night. For me, it was very liberating to be able to focus solely on performing and not be burdened by a lot of the decision-making and drilling down that goes into producing. It was the first time I was able to go into the studio and focus on what I do best. Keith was there to handle the rest.&quot;A collection of 12 songs, While the Gettin&#39; Is Good was written entirely by Corey. As such, it&#39;s a deeply personal album, one that explores themes of love, hometown pride and even personal discovery. A close relative inspired one of the record&#39;s highlights, &quot;Bend,&quot; about learning how to adapt to what life throws at you.&quot;I wrote &#39;Bend&#39; about a family member who was struggling with issues and I realized through writing this song that I was also talking about myself at the same time,&quot; says Corey, who scored a Top 20 album with The Broken Record in 2011. &quot;So that song really hits home.&quot;Still, the album stands as the Jefferson, Georgia, native&#39;s most upbeat. Especially on the nostalgic &quot;Pride,&quot; a bouncing look back at Corey&#39;s high school days, from pep rallies to game day. His children attend the same school he did and together they often attend high-school football games, where the one-time social studies teacher sees friendly faces from his past.&quot;I remember sitting up in the stands going, &#39;Man, this is so cool.&#39; I&#39;m so glad we decided to stay here and let my kids be a part of this tradition,&quot; he says. &quot;&#39;Pride&#39; summarizes who I am and even how my career has developed.&quot;Likewise, album opener &quot;Don&#39;t Mind&quot; coasts along with a New Orleans vibe, full of fiddle and clarinet. A fun, happy song, it sets the tone for the record and pays tribute to the things we all gladly bear when we&#39;re in love. It also epitomizes Corey&#39;s current worldview.&quot;I have a 2006 truck that runs great, so I don&#39;t need a new truck. I don&#39;t have much time to get on a big lake, so I don&#39;t need a bass boat. I could have bought some really cool stuff with the money that I spent on this record, but I didn&#39;t, because I&#39;m happy,&quot; he says. &quot;It&#39;s a privilege to be able to do something like this, finance it myself and not have anyone telling me how my music needs to sound.&quot;Nonetheless, Corey has hit on the perfect song for today&#39;s country radio: the approachable ballad &quot;Taking the Edge Off.&quot; It&#39;s a road-weary travelogue, like Bob Seger&#39;s &quot;Turn the Page&quot; or Zac Brown Band&#39;s &quot;Colder Weather,&quot; about the loneliness of touring and how people who travel combat such feelings.&quot;It captures a certain mood that we go through, especially in the winter. It&#39;s really a grind, it gets cold and lonely, and you&#39;re taking the edge off with a drink,&quot; he admits. &quot;I remember being in Omaha and it was cold as hell. I worked on that tune throughout the day and night there and every time I hear it, I am transported back to that time.&quot;Now, however, Corey is focused squarely on the future. As the new album title suggests, he&#39;s ready to make a determined grab at country&#39;s brass ring while the gettin&#39; is good. And with Keith Stegall and Sugar Hill Records behind him, the gettin&#39; has never been better. As the perseverant Corey is fond of saying, &quot;There is more than one way to skin a cat in country music.&quot;&quot;I always dreamed of being able to make a record like this. I wanted to explore all the possibilities of a song and work with a producer who was among the best and who could teach me,&quot; he says. &quot;What makes me different is that I write all these songs, and I write them from the heart. I&#39;ve lived them.&quot;Which is exactly why his fans are willing to go along for the ride and invest so much in an artist who speaks to their way of life. To Corey, While the Gettin&#39; Is Good is his way of opening up his heart, along with his wallet, and paying them back.&quot;I&#39;m going to take the goodwill they&#39;ve given me and continually invest it into making better and better records that reflect who I am and my vision,&quot; he says. &quot;They&#39;ve entrusted me with a lot, so I&#39;m trying to be the best steward I can be.&quot;", "title": "Corey Smith", "url": "http://eventful.com/chattanooga/events/corey-smith-/E0-001-109450782-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "The Signal", "date": "2018-03-23 20:30:00"}, {"city": "Savannah", "description": " <br> The way Corey Smith sees it, he owes a debt to his fans.

As such, it&#39;s a deeply personal album, one that explores themes of love, hometown pride and even personal discovery. A close relative inspired one of the record&#39;s highlights, &quot;Bend,&quot; about learning how to adapt to what life throws at you.&quot;I wrote &#39;Bend&#39; about a family member who was struggling with issues and I realized through writing this song that I was also talking about myself at the same time,&quot; says Corey, who scored a Top 20 album with The Broken Record in 2011. &quot;So that song really hits home.&quot;Still, the album stands as the Jefferson, Georgia, native&#39;s most upbeat. Especially on the nostalgic &quot;Pride,&quot; a bouncing look back at Corey&#39;s high school days, from pep rallies to game day. His children attend the same school he did and together they often attend high-school football games, where the one-time social studies teacher sees friendly faces from his past.&quot;I remember sitting up in the stands going, &#39;Man, this is so cool.&#39; I&#39;m so glad we decided to stay here and let my kids be a part of this tradition,&quot; he says. &quot;&#39;Pride&#39; summarizes who I am and even how my career has developed.&quot;Likewise, album opener &quot;Don&#39;t Mind&quot; coasts along with a New Orleans vibe, full of fiddle and clarinet. A fun, happy song, it sets the tone for the record and pays tribute to the things we all gladly bear when we&#39;re in love. It also epitomizes Corey&#39;s current worldview.&quot;I have a 2006 truck that runs great, so I don&#39;t need a new truck. I don&#39;t have much time to get on a big lake, so I don&#39;t need a bass boat. I could have bought some really cool stuff with the money that I spent on this record, but I didn&#39;t, because I&#39;m happy,&quot; he says. &quot;It&#39;s a privilege to be able to do something like this, finance it myself and not have anyone telling me how my music needs to sound.&quot;Nonetheless, Corey has hit on the perfect song for today&#39;s country radio: the approachable ballad &quot;Taking the Edge Off.&quot; It&#39;s a road-weary travelogue, like Bob Seger&#39;s &quot;Turn the Page&quot; or Zac Brown Band&#39;s &quot;Colder Weather,&quot; about the loneliness of touring and how people who travel combat such feelings.&quot;It captures a certain mood that we go through, especially in the winter. It&#39;s really a grind, it gets cold and lonely, and you&#39;re taking the edge off with a drink,&quot; he admits. &quot;I remember being in Omaha and it was cold as hell. I worked on that tune throughout the day and night there and every time I hear it, I am transported back to that time.&quot;Now, however, Corey is focused squarely on the future. As the new album title suggests, he&#39;s ready to make a determined grab at country&#39;s brass ring while the gettin&#39; is good. And with Keith Stegall and Sugar Hill Records behind him, the gettin&#39; has never been better. As the perseverant Corey is fond of saying, &quot;There is more than one way to skin a cat in country music.&quot;&quot;I always dreamed of being able to make a record like this. I wanted to explore all the possibilities of a song and work with a producer who was among the best and who could teach me,&quot; he says. &quot;What makes me different is that I write all these songs, and I write them from the heart. I&#39;ve lived them.&quot;Which is exactly why his fans are willing to go along for the ride and invest so much in an artist who speaks to their way of life. To Corey, While the Gettin&#39; Is Good is his way of opening up his heart, along with his wallet, and paying them back.&quot;I&#39;m going to take the goodwill they&#39;ve given me and continually invest it into making better and better records that reflect who I am and my vision,&quot; he says. &quot;They&#39;ve entrusted me with a lot, so I&#39;m trying to be the best steward I can be.&quot;", "title": "Corey Smith", "url": "http://eventful.com/savannah/events/corey-smith-/E0-001-108130674-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "The Stage on Bay", "date": "2018-03-16 20:00:00"}, {"city": "Bloomington", "description": " with Earl Dibbles Jr, SmithField<br> My name is Granger Smith. Sometimes long, fancy industry bios are helpful, but other times you just need to hear from the guy actually living it, so heres my story.I was born and raised Texan, and Im proud of that. I grew up along with 2 brothers, a couple of yellow labrador retrievers and parents that stayed together because they loved each other. My life changed when I was 14 years old and decided I would teach myself to play guitar. This was motivated by two things: I thought the guitar would make girls pay attention to me, and the fact that George Strait played one. By the time I turned 15, I was performing weekends on small town stages in North Texas, and doing my best as a fan club member to attend every George Strait concert within driving distance. Playing high school football was an important rite of passage for me, along with hunting and fishing, but the dream of a music career consumed me. At age 19, I was satisfied with enough songs I had written to make an album. As a freshman at Texas A&M, I was able to scrape together some studio money by pre-selling the album to friends around campus. For being just a kid, that album did pretty good. It landed me a songwriting deal with EMI Music Publishing in Nashville, and the following year, I took the leap to Tennessee.My time in Nashville was important. I absorbed the craft of songwriting from some of the best, learned my way around studios and recording gear, (which paid off for me later) and cut my teeth on countless stages as both a singer and as a steel guitar player for other singers. After four years, I had a shelf full of song demos, a little bit of music business know-how and a strong conviction to move back to Texas, finish my degree at Texas A&M, and start a band.Moving back to College Station was basically starting over. The gigs were hard to book and when they did, nobody showed up to watch. But I was happy and felt creative. I saved money by making albums out of my house and using my band. We wore out vehicles from two pickup trucks, to a suburban, to a van and then another van. The trailers we towed got bigger, and ever so slowly, so did our crowds. I learned how to use a camera & some editing software for making homemade music videos and we made lots of them.My little brother, Tyler joined me in 2008. He traded a pretty good job at the bank to jump in an old van and sell t-shirts in honky-tonk dive bars. I think he did it not only because he shared the same vision as me, but also because his competitive nature was excited about proving a bunch of people wrong. And thats exactly what we did. Together we conspired and worked from the ground up with the goal of not only building an artist, but a brand. We embraced social media, searched for connection with fans, studied our predecessors and ignored our doubters. The good shows helped pay for all the bad ones, and the songs that sold helped fund all the others that didnt. We put communities first, knowing that without the people, we were without a job.We created alter egos through videos to help promote the music and thats where Earl Dibbles Jr came from in the summer of 2011. It started as a short, funny video that my brothers and I filmed where my parents live in Central Texas, but it turned out to be something that completely changed the shape of my career. I actually like to think of it as an intentional accident because as planned, the video went viral and became a huge promotional tool for my music, but we had no way to know if it would actually work. Especially since many of my videos before it never caught fire.In the early morning of April 16th 2013, I woke up and checked the iTunes store on my phone with tired eyes. I was absolutely shocked to see my new album, Dirt Road Driveway sitting at #1. Things were rapidly changing on the road too. We were seeing sold out shows in markets we had never played, and a passion in fans unlike anything I had seen before. After independently releasing 7 studio albums, 1 live album and 2 EPs, I finally signed my first record deal in 2015. I met some great people at Broken Bow Music Group in Nashville who sought us out, believed in my dedication and wanted to take what I was already doing, and magnify the message. We worked together not only as colleagues, but as friends on the same mission. Within only weeks of the signing, my debut single Backroad Song was a hit a mainstream country radio faster than any of us expected. On February 14, 2016, the single became the most played in America as it topped all the mainstream radio charts. This was a lifelong dream for me both as a singer and songwriter. The following month, my first national debut album, Remington hit stores.A few years ago, I was standing with my boots in red, sandy Iraqi soil watching a beautifully majestic Middle Eastern sunset, when one of my band members asked me, Can you believe music got us here? No, I cant. What a journey its been since I decided to chase this crazy dream. Weve played 10 countries, 3 continents, even the White House a few times, and I still cant believe it all started with a few guitar chords. I have a song called Sleeping On The Interstate where I wrote, Connecting map dots like poets and prisoners, trying to live more like a lover than sinner, slave to dreams so far away. Thats me. If theres one thing Ive learned from the music business, its that you dont really choose this life, you are this life. Thats the truth no matter if youre selling albums or not. I do what I love and love what I do, and theres no sweeter freedom than that.", "title": "Granger Smith", "url": "http://eventful.com/bloomington_il/events/granger-smith-/E0-001-109903989-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "The Castle Theatre", "date": "2018-02-01 20:00:00"}, {"city": "Seattle", "description": " <br> Jorja Smith (born June 11, 1997) is an English singer from Walsall, West Midlands.

The band consisted of  Morrissey (vocals, lyrics), Johnny Marr (guitar, music), Mike Joyce (drums) and Andy Rourke (bass). Hugely influential, The Smiths lasted all of five years from 1982 to 1987, releasing during this period four studio albums (The Smiths, Meat Is Murder, The Queen Is Dead and Strangeways, Here We Come) and three compilation albums (Hatful Of Hollow, The World Won't Listen and Louder Than Bombs). Meat Is Murder went on to enter the British charts at number one in February of 1985, and The Queen Is Dead further confirmed the band's popularity with its release in spring 1986. Greeted with enthusiastic reviews and peaking at number two on the U.K. charts, the album also developed The Smiths' cult following in the U.S., breaking into the Top 100.\n\nAfter the band's split in 1987, a further six albums have been released, bringing the total number of Smiths albums to 13. These albums consisted of another five compilation albums (Best... I, ...Best II, Singles, The Very Best of the Smiths and The Sound of the Smiths), and one live album (Rank) recorded before the band's split during The Queen Is Dead tour. Both \"Best I\" and \"Best II\" were heavily criticised by critics and some fans; \"The Very Best of\", was very similar content to said \"Best\" albums, sold excellently, but drew much criticism from press and the band, who had no input.\n\nFormer members\n\nBass was originally played by Dale Hibbert, but he was replaced after 4 months. Craig Gannon was briefly a second guitarist for the band in 1986.\nSee The Smiths First Meetings  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

1 Radio with Zane Lowe. The dreamy experiment between blues and rock served as the first preview of Gambino\u2019s highly anticipated third studio album, \u201cAwaken, My Love!\u201d\n\nPrior to its official release, Gambino wheeled the song out a number of times to tease fans. First, after much speculation surrounding the possible end of his musical career, Gambino headlined the 2015 Bonnaroo Music Festival and surprised fans with this then-untitled song. The song was next spotted in a promo entitled \u201cMomma\u201d for the first season of Gambino\u2019s critically acclaimed FX show, Atlanta. Perhaps most notably, Gambino opened up his secretive three-day music festival PHAROS in September 2016 with a variation of this song. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Childish+Gambino/_/Me+and+Your+Mama\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

I'm thirteen and so are you.\nBefore I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes I hadn't met yet, running around all summer, getting into trouble. It turned out it would be me and just one girl. That's you.\n\nAnd we're still at camp as long as we're on the bus and not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us. We're still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pine needles. I like you and you like me and I more-than-like you, but I don't know if you do or don't more-than-like me. You've never said.\n\nSo I haven't been saying anything all summer, content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me and choosing to do so again the next day and so on. A girl who's smart and funny and who, if I say something dumb for a laugh, is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh, but who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be. A girl who reads books that no one's assigned to her, whose curly brown hair has a line running through it from where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet.\n\nBack in the real world we don't go to the same school, and unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood, we won't go to the same high school. So, this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something. And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something.\n\nThe sun's gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep. We're talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop that looks like a kid we know. And then I'm like, \"Can I tell you something?\"\n\nAnd all of a sudden I'm telling you. And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming and your face is there and gone and there and gone as we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway. And there's no expression on it. And I think just after a point I'm just talking to lengthen the time where we live in a world where you haven't said \"yes\" or \"no\" yet. And regrettably I end up using the word \"destiny.\" I don't remember in what context. Doesn't matter.\n\nBefore long, I'm out of stuff to say and you smile and say, \"okay.\" I don't know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive and I would leave in order not to spoil the moment, but there's nowhere to go because we're are on a bus. So I pretend like I'm asleep and before long, I really am.\n\nI wake up, the bus isn't moving anymore. The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on. I turn and you're not there. Then again a lot of kids aren't in their seats anymore. We're parked at the pick-up point, which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church. The bus is half empty. You might be in your dad's car by now, your bags and things piled high in the trunk. The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus, just as one of them reaches my row. It used to be our row, on our way off.\n\nIt's Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week after throwing rocks at my head. Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise. She stops and looks down at me. And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light, so I can't really see her face, but I can see her smile. And she says one word: \"destiny.\" Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh and then she turns and leads\nThem off the bus. I didn't know you were friends with them.\n\nI find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is over. So is summer, even though there's two weeks until school starts.\n\nThis isn't a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad, this is a story about how I learned something and I'm not saying this thing is true or not, I'm just saying it's what I learned.\n\nI told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody. So I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always. Everybody can't turn around and tell\nEverybody. Everybody already knows, I told them.\n\nBut this means there isn't a place in my life for you or someone like you. Is it sad? Sure. But it's a sadness I chose. I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy and got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit. But that's not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the bus. I still haven't.", "youtube": {"duration": 427, "date_published": "2011-11-13 17:56:31", "video_id": "SgVH9vd06Xo", "description": "That Power, from Childish Gambino's album, \"Camp\"."}, "description": "Questlove plays the drums on \u201cThat Power\u201d.\nCamp may have been self-produced by CG (along with long time musical collaborator Ludwig), but Roots boss man and late-night TV star Questlove played the drums on album closer \u201cThat Power\u201d.

Equally evocative of blues grit and hip-hop bounce, the Los Angeles-based vocal powerhouse and multi-instrumentalist leapt forward by taking a deeper look at some of her earliest inspirationsincluding Howlin Wolf, Robert Johnson, and Vera Ward Hall and Big Mama Thornton.For me, this album wasnt really about experimenting, she admits. It was more about simplicity, honing in on what I love about music and what makes me who I am as an artist. Growing up, I listened to a lot of hip-hop and blues, and I love those two genres so much. Sometimes, to evolve you dont need to go outside of yourself; you can reach further inside of yourself instead.Its a realization earned over a whirlwind five years. The Fedora-rocking, guitar-shredding, harmonica-wielding blues siren peppered an old backporch musical recipe with hip-hop urgency and hashtaggable wisdom on her 2012 mixtape Eleven Roses. Followed by her full-length debut Til The Casket Drops yielded a veritable hit in the form of Put The Gun Down. The latter generated 7.4 million-plus Spotify streams and held strong in the Top 10 of AAA radio for 10 weeks as well as receiving over 100 high-profile licensing placements and syncs, including the feature film Were The Millers. Kendrick Lamar [Cryin Wolf] and Freddie Gibbs [Criminal] were quick to collaborate, while Rolling Stone, Guitar World, Elle, Interview Magazine, USA Today, NPR and more extolled her. She lit up the screen on Jimmy Kimmel LIVE!, Conan, Good Morning America, TheTonightShow, The View, and many others and practically set stages ablaze on tours with Eric Clapton, Gary Clark, Jr., and Fitz & The Tantrums and at Coachella, Bonnaroo, Firefly, and Made In America.Coming off the road, she decided to open up more than ever before.All of my favorite artists would tell real stories, she goes on. I wanted to talk about similar things that were close to my heart. Every song became something I experienced. Ive had my slew of disappointing relationships, times when I was pissed off, heart broken and times when I felt false senses of euphoria. There are times when you struggle with yourself or with somebody else. I wanted to pour all of those emotions into my music, stay true to my roots, and tap into what inspired me in the first place.Capturing this vision, ZZ recorded around L.A. at different studios and at home over the course of 2015 and 2016. She re-teamed with previous collaborators such as Blended Babies [Chance the Rapper, Kid Cudi], Neff-U [Eminem, Dr Dre], Ludwig Goransson [Childish Gambino, Haim] and Michael Fitzpatrick of Fitz & The Tantrums in addition to Warren Oak Felder of Pop & Oak [Kehlani, Alicia Keys, Alessia Cara] for the first time. It was all about getting that raw emotion, she exclaims.The first new single The Deep [feat. Joey Purp] emerged as a welcome surprise for fans, bottling the creative burst of confessional crooning and clever rap wordplay that defined Eleven Roses. A sample of The Charmels As Long As Ive Got You draped in classic slide guitar scorches as ZZ sings, Dont know how much I can take, but I need it before finger-snaps elevate the harmony. Kicking off 2017, W called it, her most candid body of work yet, and The Fader praised its spectacular effect.&quot;&#39;The Deep&#39; is about feeling trapped in a relationship that I knew was no good for me, she sighs. I met someone that made me lose control of myself. When I wrote the song, we noticed something really haunting aboutThe Charmels&#39; &#39;As Long As I&#39;ve Got You,&#39; and we just had to sample it. I thought Joey would be perfect to bring a fiery passion and flavor to the song.&quot;Elsewhere on the record, she serves up a gospel-style plea on the stirring and stark Help Me Mama. Help Me Mamais about my personal revelation that not everything in life is what it seems. Growing up I had expectations about what my relationships should be like with other people, the world and even myself. Realizing nothing would ever be perfect, I had to take control of my life and, unlike when I was a kid, Mama isnt always going to be around to solve my problems.Her booming delivery on Cannonball belies a delicate admission ofadmittedly being used by someone to pass the time. Meanwhile, Domino hits us right in the heart. Fitzand I wrotethis song aboutrecurring relationships that wed had in our pasts that left us feeling unsatisfied, she adds. I spent many sleepless nights feeling like there was something more out there for me. This song talks about the hopeless journey I faced trying to find the right person.In the end,The Storm representsZZ at her core.This album as a whole really reflects much of the internal and external conflict that I&#39;ve experienced. I feellike I dug deeper into what means the most to me, she leaves off.I hope that my stories connect with people out there and help them know they arent alone in these struggles.Thats what I can give to the world. Storms come and storms pass, it&#39;s how you weather them that defines you and makes you stronger.", "title": "ZZ Ward", "url": "http://washingtondc.eventful.com/events/zz-ward-/E0-001-108671565-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "9:30 Club", "date": "2018-02-16 20:00:00"}, {"city": "Denver", "description": " In a blossoming hip-hop hotbed of talent, Malcolm &quot;Mac Miller&quot; McCormick is next up out of Pittsburgh, PA. A recent graduate of Taylor Allderdice High School, Mac caught the eyes and ears of Rostrum Records, inking a deal in July 2010. A multitalented musician who can play numerous instruments and a young novice of the freestyle/cipher/battle circuit of his hometown, Mac has been paving his way to superstardom in his blue-collar hometown for years.<br><br> Born in 1992, Mac taught himself to play piano, drums, guitar, and bass by the age of 6. Then, after learning to compose songs in a variety of musical genres, he began studying the art of rhyme. Influenced by the styles of artists such as Big L, Lauryn Hill, Outkast, and A Tribe Called Quest, Mac soon developed a reputation for delivering jaw-dropping freestyles in Pittsburgh.<br><br> Recording his first songs in the Fall of 2007, Mac went on to form a duo called The Ill Spoken. By 2009, Mac began recording solo records. During this time he released &quot;The Jukebox&quot; and &quot;The High Life&quot; and began to generate a legitimate buzz in the streets and online.<br><br> By of July 2010, Mac&#39;s buzz became undeniable. With a handful of offers on the table, the young phenom decided to sign with independent powerhouse Rostrum Records. In August 2010, Mac released his Rostrum Records debut &quot;K.I.D.S.&quot; and took the internet and music industry by storm.<br><br> The Source Magazine says &quot;The sky is the limit for this 19 year old Pittsburgh native,&quot; while HipHopDx labeled Mac as &quot;The Steel City&#39;s next superstar.&quot; Mac was featured on the cover of XXL Magazine&#39;s coveted Top Freshman in January 2011. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette says &quot;Miller&#39;s skillful rhymes, humorous themes and upbeat demeanor are catching the nation by storm.&quot; Complex Magazine calls Miller &quot;The Steel City&#39;s newest rap posterboy.&quot; while URB Magazine calls Mac &quot;a young emcee who is the real thing.&quot; Mac&#39;s music is also a mainstay on popular hip-hop sites such as Nahright, 2dopeboyz, Rapradar, TheSmokingSection, Allhiphop, and Illroots.<br><br> Mac&#39;s greatest strength though could be his ability to shine in front of the camera. Soon after signing to Rostrum, Miller was thrust onto several national radio shows for interviews and impromptu freestyles, which have now become Youtube viral video classics. To coincide with his debut Rostrum free albums &quot;K.I.D.S.&quot; and &quot;Best Day Ever&quot; Mac continued to team up with hometown filmmaker/videographer Rex Arrow Films. Mac&#39;s videos have now surpassed 250 million hits on www.youtube.com/treejtv, including 6 with 15 million plus views a piece. The success of his early street buzz and social media dominance have now transitioned Mac to sold out shows across the world with The Incredibly Dope Tour upstreaming to the internationally sold out Blue Slide Park Tour with almost 200,000 tickets sold in the past year.<br><br> The year 2011 also showcased Mac&#39;s selling potential as his debut Rostrum EP, &quot;On and On and Beyond,&quot; sold over 75,000 copies digitally alone. Mac has also sold over 1.5 million singles total with little to no radio airplay. In November of 2011, Mac continued his surge of success by becoming the first independent artist since 1995 to debut atop the Billboard Charts with &quot;Blue Slide Park.&quot; As of January 2012, &quot;Blue Slide Park&quot; had sold almost 250,000 copies. Look for Mac Miller to be the new face of music in 2012 and beyond.<br> Genre blending has always been a core tenant of Jauz \u2013 the project of 21 year old LA-based and Icon Collective graduate, Sam Vogel. Over the course of the past few months we have seen the young star rise, turning in some of the biggest tracks of the year, from taking on the likes of Ed Sheeran, Asap Mob, Childish Gambino, and more. Jauz has released addictive mid-tempo originals like \u201cFeel the Volume\u201d and remixes like \u201cHella Hoes\u201d that have left both the festivals and clubs wanting more and garnered him support from industry heavyweights like Zedd, Skrillex, Diplo, Borgore, Destructo, Arty and others. His euphoric originals and viral remixes seamlessly weave in and out of several musical categories, staying true to his creed: \u201cmusic has no boundaries.\u201d<br>", "title": "Icelantic's Winter On The Rocks ft.

Followed by her full-length debut Til The Casket Drops yielded a veritable hit in the form of \u201cPut The Gun Down.\u201d The latter generated 7.4 million-plus Spotify streams and held strong in the Top 10 of AAA radio for 10 weeks as well as receiving over 100 high-profile licensing placements and syncs, including the feature film We\u2019re The Millers. Kendrick Lamar [\u201cCryin Wolf\u201d] and Freddie Gibbs [\u201cCriminal\u201d] were quick to collaborate, while Rolling Stone, Guitar World, Elle, Interview Magazine, USA Today, NPR and more extolled her. She lit up the screen on Jimmy Kimmel LIVE!, Conan, Good Morning America, The Tonight Show, The View, and many others and practically set stages ablaze on tours with Eric Clapton, Gary Clark, Jr., and Fitz & The Tantrums and at Coachella, Bonnaroo, Firefly, and Made In America.<br> Coming off the road, she decided to open up more than ever before.<br> \u201cAll of my favorite artists would tell real stories,\u201d she goes on. \u201cI wanted to talk about similar things that were close to my heart. Every song became something I experienced. I\u2019ve had my slew of disappointing relationships, times when I was pissed off, heart broken and times when I felt false senses of euphoria. There are times when you struggle with yourself or with somebody else. I wanted to pour all of those emotions into my music, stay true to my roots, and tap into what inspired me in the first place.\u201d<br> Capturing this vision, ZZ recorded around L.A. at different studios and at home over the course of 2015 and 2016. She re-teamed with previous collaborators such as Blended Babies [Chance the Rapper, Kid Cudi], Neff-U [Eminem, Dr Dre], Ludwig Goransson [Childish Gambino, Haim] and Michael Fitzpatrick of Fitz & The Tantrums in addition to Warren \u201cOak\u201d Felder of Pop & Oak [Kehlani, Alicia Keys, Alessia Cara] for the first time. \u201cIt was all about getting that raw emotion,\u201d she exclaims.<br> The first new single \u201cThe Deep\u201d [feat. Joey Purp] emerged as a welcome surprise for fans, bottling the creative burst of confessional crooning and clever rap wordplay that defined Eleven Roses. A sample of The Charmels\u2019 \u201cAs Long As I\u2019ve Got You\u201d draped in classic slide guitar scorches as ZZ sings, \u201cDon\u2019t know how much I can take, but I need it\u201d before finger-snaps elevate the harmony. Kicking off 2017, W called it, \u201cher most candid body of work yet,\u201d and The Fader praised its \u201cspectacular effect.\u201d<br> &quot;&#39;The Deep&#39; is about feeling trapped in a relationship that I knew was no good for me,\u201d she sighs. \u201cI met someone that made me lose control of myself. When I wrote the song, we noticed something really haunting about The Charmels&#39; &#39;As Long As I&#39;ve Got You,&#39; and we just had to sample it. I thought Joey would be perfect to bring a fiery passion and flavor to the song.&quot;<br> Elsewhere on the record, she serves up a gospel-style plea on the stirring and stark \u201cHelp Me Mama.\u201d \u201c\u2018Help Me Mama\u2019 is about my personal revelation that not everything in life is what it seems. Growing up I had expectations about what my relationships should be like with other people, the world and even myself. Realizing nothing would ever be perfect, I had to take control of my life and, unlike when I was a kid, Mama isn\u2019t always going to be around to solve my problems. <br> Her booming delivery on \u201cCannonball\u201d belies a delicate admission of admittedly being used by someone to pass the time. <br> Meanwhile, \u201cDomino\u201d hits us right in the heart. \u201cFitz and I wrote this song about recurring relationships that we\u2019d had in our pasts that left us feeling unsatisfied,\u201d she adds. \u201cI spent many sleepless nights feeling like there was something more out there for me. This song talks about the hopeless journey I faced trying to find the right person.\u201d<br> In the end, The Storm represents ZZ at her core. \u201cThis album as a whole really reflects much of the internal and external conflict that I&#39;ve experienced. I feel like I dug deeper into what means the most to me,\u201d she leaves off. \u201cI hope that my stories connect with people out there and help them know they aren\u2019t alone in these struggles. That\u2019s what I can give to the world. Storms come and storms pass, it&#39;s how you weather them that defines you and makes you stronger.", "title": "ZZ Ward The Storm Tour - Black Pistol Fire", "url": "http://portland.eventful.com/events/zz-ward-storm-tour-black-pistol-fire-/E0-001-108124098-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Aladdin Theater", "date": "2018-03-04 20:00:00"}], "description": "Donald McKinley Glover (/\u02c8\u0261l\u028cv\u0259r/; born September 25, 1983) is an American actor, comedian and musician. As a recording artist, he usually performs with the stage name Childish Gambino. While a disk jockey, he performs as mcDJ. He first came to attention for his work with Derrick Comedy and with the help of Tina Fey, was hired at the age of 21 to become a writer for the NBC comedy series 30 Rock. He later played college student Troy Barnes on the NBC sitcom Community. After several self-released albums and mixtapes, Glover signed to Glassnote Records in 2011 as Childish Gambino. He released Camp on Glassnote on November 15, 2011. His second studio album, Because the Internet, was released on December 10, 2013. Glover was nominated for two Grammy Awards in 2015, Best Rap Album for Because the Internet and Best Rap Performance for his single \"3005\".\n\nGlover was born at Edwards Air Force Base, California and raised in Stone Mountain, Georgia. His mother, Beverly (Smith, is a retired daycare provider, and his father, Donald, Sr., is a retired postal worker. His parents also served as DeKalb County foster parents for 14 years. He was raised a Jehovah's Witness. He was voted \"Most Likely to Write for The Simpsons\" in his High School yearbook. Glover graduated from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts with a degree in dramatic writing in 2006.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2009, Glover was a writer for the NBC series 30 Rock where he also had occasional cameo appearances. He was presented the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Comedy Series at the February 2009 ceremony for his work on the third season. Glover's stage name, Childish Gambino, came from the Wu-Tang Clan's name generator. On June 5, 2008, he released an independent album, titled Sick Boi. Glover would then become a member of the sketch comedy group Derrick Comedy, along with Dominic Dierkes, Meggie McFadden, DC Pierson, and Dan Eckman. The group wrote and starred in a feature-length film, Mystery Team, released in theaters in 2009.\n\nOn September 17, 2009, Childish Gambino released the independent album Poindexter. A pair of mixtapes, titled I Am Just a Rapper and I Am Just A Rapper 2 were released, in close succession in 2010. Robert Scahill added his producing expertise helping with the majority of the tracks. The track listings for those mixtapes consist of the name of the song \"he\" raps, followed by the song he raps over. His second album, Culdesac, was set to be released on July 2, 2010, but a couple of last minute additions caused the album to be delayed for a day. The album was made available on July 3. Glover has stated in interviews that on Sick Boi and Poindexter he felt he had to hide behind gimmicks, such as pink hoodies, but with his subsequent projects, he has touched on more personal subject matter, including family, schoolyard bullying, troubled romantic relationships, suicidal thoughts and alcoholism. He has disowned his 2005 album, The Younger I Get, as the too-raw ramblings of what he calls a \"decrepit Drake.\"\n\nGlover's stand-up special aired on Comedy Central on March 19, 2010. In May 2010, a fan suggested Glover for the role of Peter Parker in the then-upcoming The Amazing Spider-Man film, encouraging his supporters to retweet the hashtag \"#donald4spiderman\". The campaign, originally started to see how far social networking could carry a message, quickly gained a large following. The call for Glover to be allowed to audition for the role was supported by Spider-Man creator Stan Lee. Glover was not awarded an audition and the role instead went to Andrew Garfield. He would later reveal that he was never contacted by anyone from Sony Pictures for the role. Comics writer Brian Michael Bendis, who announced an African-American version of Spider-Man a year later, said he had conceived of the character before Glover's campaign went viral. Bendis gave credit to Glover for influencing the new hero's looks for Spider-man after seeing him dressed as Spider-Man on Community (a nod to the campaign), Bendis said, \"I saw him in the costume and thought, 'I would like to read that book.'\" Glover would later voice this incarnation of Spider-Man on the Ultimate Spider-Man animated series.\n\nGlover received the Rising Comedy Star award at the Just for Laughs festival in July 2010. Glover was featured in Gap's 2010 Holiday ad campaign. He DJs and produces electronic music under the moniker \"mcDJ\" (pronounced \"M-C-D-J\"). His music is often made available for free download via his website.[citation needed]\n\nOn December 1, 2010, Glover released the first track off of his EP titled \"Be Alone\".

On February 25, Glover released the dates for the IAMDONALD tour and also his very first music video for \"Freaks and Geeks\".

On September 20, his first official single, \"Bonfire\", was released.\n\nThe IAMDONALD tour made 24 stops in 34 days, beginning with Ames, Iowa, on April 16, and finishing with Minneapolis on May 19. In between, this included stops at music venues in Las Vegas, Houston, Washington, and Atlanta. The tour was a one-man live show that consisted of rap, comedy, and video segments.\n\nThe Sign-Up Tour was Glover's next pre-album tour. He visited 11 cities over the course of 38 days in October and November 2011. Glover made a website for the tour called Camp Gambino on November 19, four days after his album released. The tour featured special guest Danny Brown and made 20 stops during the course of 32 days along a dates in California in December.

Consequently, Glover decided to reduce his work for NBC, and only appears in the first five episodes of Community's 13-episode fifth season. Although many TV stations were interested in picking up his half-hour comedy, he ultimately picked FX due to their willingness to work around his touring schedule.\n\nOn October 6, 2013, Glover announced on Twitter that his second studio album was completed.

He was a beatnik poet, but more accurately a proto-Hippie, choosing to wear long hair, a full beard and long, white, flowing garments that promoted a Christ-like appearance. He lived in Griffith Park in Los Angeles and ate fruit, vegetables and nuts. Ahbez was born in Brooklyn in 1908, and he claimed to have been raised in an orphanage and to have crossed the US on foot 8 times before age 35. He moved to Los Angeles in the '40s, lived on 3 dollars a week, and lectured on Hollywood street corners about Oriental mysticism.\n\nAhbez implored Nat King Cole's manager to look at his manuscript of \"Nature Boy.\" Cole recognized the Yiddish melody, liked the lyrics and added it to his act. It was well received so Cole decided to record it. One problem: Cole and Capitol Records could not find Ahbez in order to secure the publishing rights. Finally they located Ahbez, camped beneath the first L in the \"Hollywood\" sign.\n\nNat King Cole recorded one other Ahbez song - \"Land of Love.\" Ahbez released his own album in 1960 called Eden's Island. He spent time with Brian Wilson before The Beach Boys recorded Pet Sounds. Ahbez, his wife, Anna, and their son Zoma lived in Griffith Park with their bicycle, sleeping bags and a juicer. With their unusual lifestyle, the family became legendary.\n\nAccording to his friend Joe Romersa, Ahbez wanted to correct the last lyric.

(1950). It won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for 1950. The arrangement..."}, "description": "In this song, Nat King Cole compares his love to the famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci. The Mona Lisa is famous for her smile and her mystique, as the portrait has become one of the most famous works of art in history.\n\nThis song was written by Ray Evans and Jay Livingston for the movie Captain Carey, U.S.A... It won an Oscar for Best Song. \n\nBefore this big hit Nat King Cole was better known as a pianist. As a result of the success of this recording he became recognized as a vocalist.\n\nThis soundtrack version by Nat King Cole spent 8 weeks as #1 in the Billboard chart in the USA in 1950. \n\nIn 1987, this was used as the theme of the British film Mona Lisa. \n\nLivingston told American Songwriter Magazine July/August 1988 the story behind this song: \"There was a picture called OSS, which took place during World War II, and Alan Ladd was in a little Italian town where the clandestine radio was, and they needed a song to warn them that the German patrol was coming. There was this blind accordion player who wasn't blind playing on the street and every time he saw the Germans coming he would play a certain melody, so we wrote 'Mona Lisa' and they said that it sounded Italian and they liked it. Then they called us and said they had changed the title from OSS to After Midnight and we had to write a song with that title. They loved title songs because it sold their picture. So we threw away the lyrics of 'Mona Lisa' and wrote 'After Midnight.' A month later we picked up Variety and read where Alan Ladd's new picture was going to be called Captain Carey, USA.\n\nWe went back to the studio and asked for 'Mona Lisa' back, and then pitched it to Nat King Cole and he liked it and recorded it on the back of 'The Greatest Inventor of Them All.' So we went on a junket for Paramount about that time, and we took the records with us and we must have been on 25 or 30 radio shows, and when we got back the song was a hit. But the original ads for the record didn't even mention 'Mona Lisa,' just 'The Greatest Inventor.' I think us pushing it really made the difference in that song being a hit.\"\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nat+King+Cole/_/Mona+Lisa\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Meyerson Symphony Center", "date": "2018-03-18 14:30:00"}], "description": "Nat \"King\" Cole (March 17th 1919\u2013February 15th  1965) was a popular American singer and jazz musician. \n\nAs a piano player, he formed a jazz trio in 1938 that played Los Angeles nightclubs, one of the first jazz trios featuring guitar and piano. Prior to this he had played music since he was a child and had worked with bands since he was sixteen. He was raised in Chicago and exposed to the abundant jazz scene there. He was heavily influenced by pianist Earl \"Fatha\" Hines.\n\nLater he became more popularly known as a singer and crooner and his work became more orchestrated.\n\nHis first mainstream vocal hit was in 1944 with Straighten Up and Fly Right, based on a black folk tale that his father had used as a theme for a sermon. Although hardly a rocker, the song's success proved that an audience for folk-based material existed. It is considered a predecessor to the first rock and roll records. Indeed, Bo Diddley, who performed similar transformations of folk material, counted Cole as an influence.\n\nBeginning in the late 1940s, Cole began recording and performing more pop-oriented material for mainstream audiences, often accompanied by a string orchestra. His stature as a popular icon was cemented during this period with such hits as The Christmas Song (1946), Nature Boy (1948), Mona Lisa (1950), and his signature tune Unforgettable (1951). While this shift to pop music led some jazz critics and fans to accuse Cole of selling out, he never totally abandoned his musical roots; as late as 1956, for instance, he recorded an all-jazz album, After Midnight. In 1991, Mosaic Records released the Complete Nat King Cole Trio Recordings on Capitol, which contained 349 songs on twenty-seven LPs or eighteen CDs.\n\nThroughout the 1950s Cole continued to rack up hit after hit, including Smile, Pretend, A Blossom Fell, and If I May. Most of his pop hits were collaborations with famed arranger/conductor Nelson Riddle. It was with Riddle that Cole released his first ten-inch long-play album in 1953 entitled Sings for Two in Love. Several more albums followed, including the Gordon Jenkins arranged Love Is the Thing, which reached number one on the album charts in April 1957.\n\nInspired by a trip to Havana, Cuba in 1958, Nat went back there that same year and recorded Cole Espanol, an album sung entirely in Spanish and Portuguese. The album was a hit not only in the U.S., but in Latin America as well. The album was so popular, that two others followed: A mis amigos in 1959, and More Cole Espanol in 1962.\n\nMusical tastes were changing in the late 1950s, and despite a successful stab at rock n' roll with Send for Me, Cole's ballad singing had grown old to younger listeners. Like contemporaries Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, Nat found that the pop singles chart had been almost entirely taken over by youth oriented acts. In 1960, Nat's longtime collaborator Nelson Riddle, left Capitol Records for Frank Sinatra's newly formed Reprise Records label. The two parted ways with one final hit album Wild Is Love, based on lyrics by Ray Rasch and Dotty Wayne. Nat would later re-tool the concept album into an off-Broadway production called I'm With You.\n\nAs the 1960s progressed, Nat once again found success on the American singles chart, starting with the country/pop flavored hit Ramblin' Rose in August of 1962. Three more hit singles followed: Dear Lonely Hearts, Those Lazy, Hazy, Crazy Days of Summer, and That Sunday, That Summer. Nat's final album was entitled L.O.V.E, and was recorded in late 1964. It was released just prior to his death and reached number four on the Billboard Albums chart in the spring of 1965. A \"Best Of\" album went gold in 1968. His 1957 song When I Fall in Love was a chart topping hit for the U.K. in 1987.\n\nCole was the first African-American to have his own radio program. He repeated that success in the late-1950s with the first truly national television show starring an African-American. In both cases, the programs were ultimately canceled because sponsors shied away from a black artist. Cole fought racism all his life, refusing to perform in segregated venues. In 1956, he was attacked on stage in Birmingham, Alabama by members of the White Citizens' Council who apparently were attempting to kidnap him. Despite injuries, Cole completed the show but vowed never to perform in the South again.\n\nOn 23rd August 1956, Cole spoke at the Republican National Convention in the Cow Palace, San Francisco, California. He was also present at the Democratic National Convention in 1960, to throw his support behind President John F. Kennedy. Cole was also among the dozens of entertainers recruited by Frank Sinatra to perform at the Kennedy Inaugural gala in 1961. Nat King Cole frequently consulted with President Kennedy (and later President Johnson) on the issue of civil rights. Yet he was dogged by critics, who felt he shied away from controversy when it came to the civil rights issue. Among the most notable was Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, who was upset that Cole didn't take stronger action after the 1956 on-stage attack.\n\nIn 1948, Cole purchased a house in the all-white Hancock Park neighborhood in Los Angeles, California. The property owners association told Cole they didn't want any undesirables moving in, to which Cole retorted \"Neither do I. And if I see anybody undesirable coming in here, I'll be the first to complain.\"\n\nHe and his second wife, Maria Ellington, were married in Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church by Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. They had five children, including twin girls. Daughter Carol Cole, and son Kelly Cole were adopted. Kelly Cole died in 1995. Nat's daughter, Natalie Cole, and his younger brother, Freddie Cole are also singers.\n\nNatalie and her father had an unexpected hit in the summer of 1991. The younger Cole mixed a 1961 recording of her father's rendition of Unforgettable with her own voice, creating an electronic duet. Both the song and the album of the same name won several Grammy awards the following year.\n\nCole performed in many short films, and played W. C. Handy in the film Saint Louis Blues. He also appeared in The Nat King Cole Story, China Gate, and The Blue Gardenia.\n\nNat King Cole, a heavy smoker, died of lung cancer at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, California, on 15th February 1965.

You can look at somebody, he might be right there, and the next Monday he might not be.\" In an interview with the television station TV3 she said that \"...[she] always wanted to write a song about death because [she] came in contact with death at a very young age\".\n\nBillboard magazine, in its second review of the song (to accompany the U.S. re-release), called it \"another cool, smart, plenty passionate melodic jewel about the death of a friend and/or friendship, with an instantly identifiable, quick-to-the-point, singalong track\u2014maintaining Pink's stance as the smartest female millennium-era singer/songwriter, dazzling in star quality as alterna-pop's premier princess.\"\n\nThe song features acoustic guitar, keyboards, drums, and electric guitars.

She has sold over 16 million albums in the United States, over 43 million worldwide, and has won three Grammy awards.\n\nP!nk began her career as an RnB artist, signed to the predominately urban label, LaFace Records. She has since complained that because she chose to relinquish creative control to her record label, she did not like the type of music she was making at that time, and did not like her image, which included bright Pink hair. Her first album, Can't Take Me Home was a substantial success, going platinum, due to the huge pop and urban radio hit singles \"There You Go\"  and \"Most Girls\". \n\nTowards the end of 2001, P!nk decided to take her career in a new direction and have more creative control. Tired of being marketed as a another cookie-cutter pop act, and eager to become a more serious singer-songwriter and musician, P!nk sought the help of former 4 Non Blondes vocalist, Linda Perry. Together, P!nk and Perry co-wrote and co-produced most of the tracks on P!nk's sophomore album, M!ssundaztood, which was released in November 2001. The album's more pop rock sound could be heard immediately with its first single, the Linda Perry penned \"Get the Party Started\".  \"Get the Party Started\" was a huge, commercially successful single, topping the charts in many countries. The album's other singles, \"Don't Let Me Get Me\", \"Just Like A Pill\", and \"Family Portrait\" were also radio and commercial successes.\n\nIn 2003, P!nk released a new album called Try This. Eight of the thirteen tracks were co-written with Tim Armstrong of punk band Rancid. Try This reached the Top 10 on album charts in the US, Canada, UK and Australia in 2003. Though its singles \"Trouble\" and \"God Is A DJ\" didn't do as well in her home country as her previous singles, \"Trouble\" earned Pink her second Grammy award in 2003. However the singles were largely successful in the United Kingdom and Australia.\n\nP!nk's fourth album, I'm Not Dead was released in April 2006. The first single was the controversial and funny \"Stupid Girls\". The album had started causing controversy before it was even released: the song Dear Mr. President is an open letter condemning the actions of President George W. Bush. P!nk appeared on the Australian TV show \"Rove Live\", discussing the track, stating that it would never be released as a single in the United States, lest it be misinterpreted as a publicity stunt.  A DVD containing concert footage of P!nk's Try This European tour was released in May 2006.\n\nHer fifth album, Funhouse, was released in October 2008, preceded by her first solo number one on the Billboard Hot 100, \"So What\". The following singles from Funhouse, \"Sober\" and \"Please Don't Leave Me\", both charted well on their releases around the world.\n\nIn 2010 P!nk collaborated on The Imagine Project singing Don't Give Up and Imagine. She also featured in the track Won't Back Down for Enimem's album Recovery. In October 2010 she released the first single Raise Your Glass from her first compilation album Greatest Hits... So Far!!!.\n\nP!nk was the voice actress of Gloria in the animated movie Happy Feet Two, which premiered in the US on November 18, 2011. She also sang the movie's theme song Bridge of Light.\n\nP!nk's sixth album The Truth About Love was first confirmed by P!nk by Twitter on February 29, 2012. The first single from this album Blow Me (One Last Kiss) was produced by Greg Kurstin and released on July 3. P!nk announced the album title the following day, along with the news of her upcoming world tour. On September 6th P!nk performed Blow Me (One Last Kiss) live at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards. In February 2013 P!nk started her \"Truth About Love Tour\", which was so popular that she added additional dates for US/Canada and Australia.\n\nDuring this time her track Just Give Me A Reason rose up to 9th on the Hot 100, her 14th Top 10 hit on that chart. The following week this rose up to number 5, and two weeks later it topped the Billboard Hot 100 becoming her 4th number-one single in the US. It also topped the charts in several other countries worldwide, and held the top spot on the Hot 100 for three consecutive weeks. On April 29, 2013, Just Give Me a Reason became P!nk's eighth number one on Billboard's Adult Top 40, which resulted in her becoming the record holder for most number ones on that chart, beating out Maroon 5 and Katy Perry who each have seven.\n\nIn 2013, Billboard named Pink Woman of the Year, citing the success of her album The Truth About Love and of the singles \"Blow Me (One Last Kiss)\", \"Try\", \"Just Give Me a Reason\", and \"True Love\", as well as her 2013 tour, which was extended to 140 different sets due to demand. The Truth About Love earned her a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album earlier in 2013.\n\nAfter releasing The Truth About Love in 2012, RCA Records has announced that they have signed Pink for a multi-album deal that will last for years to come.\n\nIt was announced in September 2014, that Pink and Dallas Green, lead singer of City and Colour, worked together on a collaborative album, under the band name You+Me. The album, titled Rose Ave., was released on October 14, 2014. The album debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 and at number one on the US Folk Albums chart. In August 2015, Pink recorded the theme song for the 13th season of The Ellen DeGeneres Show. The song, \"Today's the Day\", was performed during the show's premiere week in New York City on September 10, 2015.\n\nIt was announced in February 2016 that Pink will cover a Beatles song, \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\", for the upcoming Netflix original series Beat Bugs. In the same month, it was announced that she had recorded a cover of \"White Rabbit\" for the movie Alice Through the Looking Glass, while in April it was revealed that she contributed the song \"Just Like Fire\" to the soundtrack of the movie. \"Just Like Fire\" has since peaked at number 10, becoming her first top 10 single since \"Just Give Me a Reason\" reached number one in April 2013. In July 2016, it was announced that Pink had written a song for French-Canadian singer Celine Dion called \"Recovering\" for inclusion on her upcoming English-language album. Pink provided guest vocals on country singer Kenny Chesney's single Setting the World on Fire which was released on August 1, 2016. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/P%21nk\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is particularly memorable for its \"G\u2013L\u2013O\u2013R\u2013I\u2013A\" chorus. \n\nIn 1999, the song received the Grammy Hall of Fame Award. In 2000, it was listed as number 81 on VH1's list of The 100 Greatest Rock Songs of All Time. In 2004, \"Gloria\" was ranked #208 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

Three days later, many were left dead. By capturing this terrible event from the unfiltered point of view of children, playwright and director <strong>Carly Wijs</strong> has created something unexpected and revelatory: a wryly humorous, poignantly matter-of-fact piece of theatre about how the young deal with trauma, and what leads people to do the unthinkable.<p>Strikingly physical in their performance, actors <strong>Gytha Parmentier</strong> and <strong>Roman Van Houtven </strong>bring a sense of innocence and levity to harrowing circumstances. Extreme situations are explained using expressive movement and absurd comic observation; choreography and conversation work exhilaratingly in tandem; and they cope with the unspeakable by constructing a world with its own creative logic, defined on a starkly minimalist set using only chalk lines, string and balloons.<p>Nothing short of remarkable, <strong><em>Us/Them </em></strong>is a disarming, profoundly provocative piece of theatre.<p>Presented by<strong> Auckland Arts Festival</strong>.\u00a0Co-produced by\u00a0<strong>BRONKS </strong>& <strong>Richard Jordan Productions </strong>with <strong>Theatre Royal Plymouth </strong>&<strong> Big\u00a0in Belgium</strong>, in association with<b>\u00a0Summerhall</b><p><strong>SPECIAL OFFERS</strong><p><strong>EARLYBIRD //</strong>\u00a0Save 15%\u00a0<strong>//</strong>\u00a0Available until 26 November 2017<p><strong>ALL THREE PACKAGE //\u00a0</strong>Book Adult tickets for any three\u00a0<strong>Auckland Arts Festival\u00a0</strong>shows at\u00a0<strong>Q Theatre</strong>\u00a0and save\u00a0<strong>//\u00a0</strong>Available until 31 January 2018\u00a0<strong>//</strong>\u00a0<a href=\"https://nz.patronbase.com/_QTheatre/Seasons/View?season_id=A18A\" rel=\"nofollow\">Book here</a><p>***** <em>\u2026playful as it is heart-breaking and thought-provoking.</em>\u00a0<strong>The Guardian</strong><p>***** <em>Unforgettable\u2026 the highlight of the Fringe.</em>\u00a0<strong>The Telegraph</strong><p><em>[Carly] Wijs has captured something special: childish innocence as it meets atrocity, and it stays with you.</em>\u00a0<strong>The Times</strong><p><strong>PLEASE NOTE // </strong>The show is about a hostage situation although no actual violence is shown.

Auf ihrem zweiten Album verfolgen die f\u00fcnf Berner diesen musikalischen Weg noch konsequenter. Indie, Rock, Postpop \u0096 wer weiss das schon. Am Anfang standen Songskizzen und eine entlegene Alph\u00fctte an der Grenze zu Italien. Am Ende steht \u0084RUN\u0093, ein Album, das ausufernde und strahlende Elemente mit Pop vereint, wie er schlichter und einnehmender nicht sein k\u00f6nnte. Die raue Berglandschaft spiegelt sich in vielen Momenten des Albums wieder. \u0084The End (Part One)\u0093 ist der songgewordene Bergsturz und die Leere danach. Irgendwo h\u00f6rt man Pink Floyds Tasten wummern, irgendwo Neil Youngs Gitarre heulen, das Schlagzeug h\u00e4mmert die letzten Brocken von den Flanken. Bis der Spuk vorbei ist und die traurige Liebeserkl\u00e4rung an das Ende jeder Geschichte beginnt. Ein Song vom unerm\u00fcdlichen Schlussstrichziehen. THEM FLEURS vereinen auf ihrem neuen Album, was sie live seit jeher auszeichnet: Hallende Gitarren und sph\u00e4rische Tastenkl\u00e4nge wechseln sich ab mit lauten und rhythmischen Parts. Was entspriesst, sind nachhaltige Refrains und unkonventionelle Arrangements. Musikalisch wird einiges gewagt und bewegt, ohne Bew\u00e4hrtes aus den Augen zu verlieren.

Best known for the garage rock standard \"Gloria\" and for launching singer-songwriter Van Morrison's careers, the group had an energetic sound that fit right into the British blues and rock boom of the 60s. With Van Morrison on vocals and harmonica, it featured as well Billy Harrison on guitar, Eric Wrixen on piano and keyboards, Alan Henderson on bass, and Ronnie Millings on drums, with several other musicians replacing those artists or doing side contributions during the life of the band.\n\nThe group released its first single, \"Don't Start Crying Now\"/\"One Two Brown Eyes, in August 1964. The single was a flop. The band's managers and producers then hired session players Jimmy Page, Peter Bardens, and drummer Bobby Graham to back Morrison on a cover of Big Joe Williams' \"Baby Please Don't Go\". The single, which featured the now-legendary \"Gloria\" as a B-side, was a smash in the U.K., sailing to #10 on the charts in December 1964. Radio DJs were also in for a big treat when the turned the record around and set loose the powerful B-side.\n\nThe band then released its biggest hit in the U.K., \"Here Comes the Night\"/\"All for Myself\", which hit #2 in March 1965. It went to #24 in the U.S. that May as well, and Them enjoyed their well-earned success. Later that year, the instrumental track additionally \"Mystic Eyes\" reached #33 in the U.S. The following year, American band Shadows of Knight had a top ten U.S. hit with their rendition of \"Gloria\", and the tune has had a long life since, covered by multiple other artists such as rockers The Doors\n\nThe band went on to release two albums on Decca, 'The Angry Young Them' and 'Them Again', and both of them failed to sell. The group found itself at a crossroads. In mid-1966, Van Morrison left the band to pursue a solo career. The rest of the outfit continued on into the early 70s, releasing four albums and touring steadily after relocating to California around 1967. Two of these post-Morrison albums, 'Now And Them' and 'Time Out! Time In For Them', found the band experimenting with psychedelia. Them reunited briefly in 1979 without Morrison yet still struggled to reach a major audience.\n\nVan Morrison went on to greater success and fame as a solo artist, but Them's combination of garage rock, blues, and soul proved a major influence on the next generation of rock musicians, and the group's best-known singles have earned praise for decades. \"Gloria\" still remains a rock n roll classic. \n\nIn April 1964, Van Morrison established an R&B club at the Maritime Hotel, Belfast with entrepreneurs Jimmy Conlon, Jerry McKernan and Gerry McKervey (known as the \"3Js\"). Morrison gave notice to the group with which he performed at the time, the Golden Eagles. With an anticipated opening night for the new R&B club approaching, he embarked on a mission to find his ideal line-up. He had recently been introduced to The Gamblers, an East Belfast group formed in 1962 by Ronnie Milling (drums, born 27 April 1940), Billy Harrison (guitar and lead vocals, born William Harrison on 14 October 1942), and Alan Henderson (bass guitar, born 26 November 1944, died April 2017). Eric Wrixon, who was still in school, had been recruited as piano player and keyboardist. Morrison joined in on tenor saxophone, harmonica and vocals. The group rehearsed over Dougie Knight's bicycle shop in Shaftesbury Square, Belfast in preparation for their debut at the Maritime. As the group now felt they needed a new name, they followed Eric Wrixon's suggestion and the Gamblers changed to Them after the 1954 sci-fi horror film.\n\nOn 14 April 1964, an advertisement in a Belfast newspaper asked: \"Who Are? What Are? THEM\". Similarly curious advertisements followed until the Friday before the gig (17 April 1964) announced that Them would be performing that evening at Club Rado at the Maritime Hotel. Attendance at the two hundred capacity venue quickly grew with a packed house by the third week.\n\nThem performed without a routine, fired by the crowd's energy: Morrison later commented that while the band was \"out of our element\" making records... \"The way we did the numbers at the Maritime was more spontaneous, more energetic, more everything, because we were feeding off the crowd.\" Morrison ad libbed songs as he performed and \"Gloria\", the classic song he had written at eighteen years old, took shape here and could last up to twenty minutes.[9] According to Morrison, \"Them lived and died on the stage at the Maritime Hotel\" but only very rudimentary recordings survive. One fan's recording, of \"Turn On Your Love Light\" made its way to Mervyn and Phil Solomon, who contacted Decca Records' Dick Rowe, who then travelled to Belfast to hear Them perform. Rowe and Phil Solomon agreed on a two-year contract with the members of the band then signed up to Solomon. Morrison, at eighteen, had to have his father sign for him. Within a few weeks, the group was taken to England and into Decca's recording studio in West Hampstead for their first recording session.\n\nThem's first recording session took place in London on 5 July 1964. \"Turn on Your Love Light\" and \"Gloria\" were recorded during this session as were both sides of their first single, \"Don't Start Crying Now\" and \"One Two Brown Eyes\" as well as \"Groovin'\", \"Philosophy\" and Bo Diddley's \"You Can't Judge a Book by Its Cover\". This session was remarkable in its employment of two drums tracks, which can be clearly heard in the stereo mixes of \"Gloria\" and \"One Two Brown Eyes\". Rowe used session musicians Arthur Greenslade on organ and Bobby Graham on second drum kit. At this late stage it became clear that the parents of Eric Wrixon, a minor in law, would not sign the contract on his behalf so he was replaced by Pat John McAuley. The single, released in August, did not prove successful.\n\nTheir next single, Big Joe Williams's \"Baby Please Don't Go\" substituted Andy White on drums, Phil Coulter on second keyboard, and added Jimmy Page on rhythm guitar. Lead guitar was the work of Billy Harrison.[citation needed] It was released in November with \"Gloria\" as its B-side. In December 1964, Them made their television debut, joining The Rolling Stones, on Ready Steady Go!. Their manager, Phil Solomon got the track used as the show's signature tune and within two weeks it was at No.19 on the UK Singles Chart, eventually peaking at No.10.\n\nIn January 1965, Them toured England for a second time, staying at the Royal Hotel, which disc jockey Jimmy Savile used as his London base. Savile helped promote the band in his column for The People but Them earned a reputation for bad manners and sarcasm in their interviews. Billy Harrison said the attitude problem may have been caused by anti-Irish sentiments on the continent at the time. But, when they were interviewed by a reporter from the Irish Independent, the reporter remarked, \"They were the most boorish bunch of youngsters I'd come across in my short career\". Phil Coulter recalled the band's interview with a female reporter: \"They would just sit and mutter monosyllabic grunts to themselves and give her off-the-wall answers\". (Morrison as a solo artist raised such interviews to a \"negative art form\"). Their management promoted Them by scheduling appearances on Ready Steady Go! and on Top Of The Pops where, rather than performing live, they were expected to mime and lip sync. Morrison said of this appearance, \"It was ridiculous. We were totally anti that type of thing... and we had to get into suits and have make-up put on and all that...\". He also revealed how the band had, until that time, considered the programme a complete joke.\n\nTheir next release was Them's biggest hit in the UK, \"Here Comes the Night\". The producer was also the writer of the song, Bert Berns, an American, who had also co-written \"Twist and Shout\". Backed with \"All for Myself\" it charted in the UK at No.2 on 22 April 1965, five weeks after entering the charts, and went to No.24 in the U.S. in May. Both tracks originate from the same session in October 1964 that yielded \"Baby Please Don't Go\" but were temporarily shelved by Decca in favor of Lulu's version of \"Here Comes the Night\" which only reached # 50 on the British charts.\n\nOn 11 April 1965, Them made a guest appearance at the NME Pollwinners Concert at Wembley Empire Pool: Jimmy Savile was MC for this event, which also included The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Kinks, The Animals, The Searchers, The Moody Blues and Dusty Springfield. The bands had been expected to keep to their current hits, but Them audaciously segued from \"Here Comes the Night\" into a seven-minute version of \"Turn on Your Lovelight\". After the performances, NME's Derek Johnson commented that Morrison had \"more genuine soul than any of his British contemporaries\".\n\nThe band released their first album, The Angry Young Them, in June 1965 (UK) and it appeared in the USA on Parrot Records in July. But Them's next single, \"One More Time\", chosen by Phil Solomon, failed \u2013 according to Billy Harrison because it never constituted single material. In July 1965, the band added English drummer Terry Noon and Scottish lead guitarist Joe Baldi (born Joseph Baldi, 10 March 1943, in La Spezia, Italy) but they left in September. Their second album, Them Again, was released in January 1966 in the UK and in April 1966 in the USA.\n\nThe group was marketed in the United States as part of the British Invasion. After the success of \"Here Comes the Night\", the band scored a chart hit again later in 1965 with \"Mystic Eyes\", which reached No.33. Them Again, released in April 1966 in the US, also charted and the band began a US tour in May 1966. From 30 May to 18 June, Them had a residency at the famous Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles. For the final week The Doors opened for Them and on the last night the two bands and Morrisons jammed a twenty-minute version of \"Gloria\" and a twenty-five-minute version of \"In the Midnight Hour\".[24] Them went on to headline at The Fillmore in San Francisco, California and then to Hawaii, where disputes erupted among band members and management over money. The band broke apart, Morrison and Henderson returning to Belfast while Ray Elliott (born Raymond Elliott, 23 January 1939, in Belfast, Co Antrim, Northern Ireland) and David Harvey (born David Tufney, 29 July 1943, in Bude, Cornwall) decided to stay in America.\n\nVan Morrison has placed the break-up of Them in context: \"There was no motive behind anything you did back then. You just did it because you wanted to do it and you enjoyed doing it. That's the way the thing started, but it got twisted somewhere along the way and everybody involved in it got twisted as well, including me.\"(1967) \"You can't take something like that, put it in a box and place a neat little name on it, then try to sell it. That's what they tried to do. That's what killed Them.\" (1973)\n\nVan Morrison went on to great success and fame as a solo artist, but Them's combination of garage rock and blues proved a major influence on the next generations of rock musicians, and the group's best-known singles have become staples of rock and roll.\n\nPost-Morrison\nIn late August 1965, Billy Harrison and Pat McAuley formed a rival Them, competing with the Morrison/Henderson line-up and leading to legal action. In March 1966, the latter won the rights to the name while the former, now without Harrison but with Pat's brother Jackie McAuley (born John McAuley, 14 December 1946, in Coleraine, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland; ex-Them, ex-Kult), were only allowed to call themselves 'Other Them' in the U.K. The McAuley brothers became, unofficially, the Belfast Gypsies (or Gipsies), though they were never actually billed as such, and recorded two singles on Island Records (one released under the name Freaks of Nature) and one Swedish-only album, all produced by Kim Fowley. They toured Europe billed as Them and released a French EP under that name but broke up in November 1966. Not long after that the Morrison line-up also reached the end of the road. In March 1967 Morrison did a short tour of the Netherlands backed by Cuby & the Blizzards and then left for New York to start his solo career. The rest regrouped in Belfast, recruited Kenny McDowell (born Kenneth McDowell, 21 December 1944, in Belfast, County Antrim, Northern Ireland) (ex-Mad Lads) as lead singer and continued touring and recording steadily after relocating to the USA in early 1967 at the invitation of producer Ray Ruff. Two albums, Now and Them and Time Out! Time In for Them, found the band experimenting with psychedelia. Then Jim Armstrong and Kenny McDowell returned to Belfast to perform as Sk'boo (Armstrong, McDowell and Ray Elliot reunited in Chicago in 1969 as \"Truth\" and recorded a number of demos and soundtrack songs later released as Of Them And Other Tales). Henderson hired session musicians for two more records for Ray Ruff's Happy Tiger Records, in a hard rock vein with country and folk elements; Them (1970) featured Jerry Cole as guitarist while Them In Reality (1971) featured lead guitarist Jim Parker and drummer John Stark (both ex-Kitchen Cinq). Henderson also co-wrote a rock opera, Truth Of Truths, produced by Ray Ruff in 1971. These efforts were met with consumer indifference and in 1972 Them dissolved. Alan Henderson, Billy Harrison and Eric Wrixon reunited in 1979, without Morrison, recording another album, Shut Your Mouth and undertaking a tour of Germany using Billy Bell on guitar and Mel Austin as vocalist. Since the 1990s, Wrixon had toured under the moniker of \"Them the Belfast Blues Band\", at one point comprising ex-Them guitarists, Jim Armstrong and Billy Harrison.\n\n\nThe band's 1964 recording of \"Gloria\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. It was rated at No.69 on Dave Marsh's 1989 book, The Heart of Rock and Soul, The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever and \"Mystic Eyes\" was rated at No.458. \"Gloria\" was listed at No.208 on the 2004 Rolling Stone magazine's feature, The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Them\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Au\u00dferdem begleitet er Waters auf dessen laufender \u201eUs & Them\u201c-Tour als Gitarrist und S\u00e4nger. Dass er nicht nur ein gefragter Session-Musiker ist, sondern als Produzent mit den Gr\u00f6\u00dfen der Branche zusammenarbeitet, ist auch kein Geheimnis. Allerdings sind es seine Solowerke, mit denen der in North Carolina Geborene in den letzten Jahren immer wieder Kritiker und Fans begeistert hat. Nach dem Ende seiner Band Muscadine gelingt ihm 2011 mit seinem Erstling \u201eGentle Spirit\u201c ein vielbeachteter Einstieg in seine Solokarriere. Das Album landet in den UK Indie Charts auf Platz 15 und schafft es im \u201aMojo\u2018-Magazin auf Nummer 4 der Jahresbestliste. Das Magazin \u201aUncut\u2018 k\u00fcrt ihn zum K\u00fcnstler des Jahres. Wilson ist ein geborener Netzwerker, hat oft viele unterschiedliche G\u00e4ste auf seinen Alben, darunter Chris Robinson (Black Crowes), Barry Goldberg und Graham Nash. Nach dem Release seines Deb\u00fcts tourt er mit Wilco durch Europa, begleitet auch Jackson Browne, fungiert an Roy Harpers 70. Geburtstag als dessen Special Guest. Von Tom Petty wird er mit seiner Band h\u00f6chstpers\u00f6nlich auf dessen \u201eMojo\u201c-Tour durch Europa im Juni 2012 eingeladen. Im Oktober 2013 bringt Wilson sein zweites Album \u201eFanfare\u201c heraus. Es erreicht Platz 8 in den UK Indie Charts,\u00a0 Platz 50 in den UK Overall Charts,\u00a0 Platz 18 in den Norway Overall Chart und\u00a0 Platz 49 in den Niederlanden. \u201aUncut\u2018 und \u201aRolling Stone Deutschland\u2018 w\u00e4hlen \u201eFanfare\u201c zum Album des Monats. Auch hier gibt es wieder viele illustre G\u00e4ste, unter ihnen David Crosby, Graham Nash, Jackson Browne, Mike Campbell, Benmont Tench, Father John Misty, Taylor Goldsmith (Dawes) und Patrick Sansone (Wilco). Auf dem Werk ist ebenfalls erneut Wilsons Band zu h\u00f6ren:\u00a0 Jason Borger, Omar Velasco, Richard Gowen und Dan Horne. Roy Harper zeichnet f\u00fcr den Text zu \u201eNew Mexico\u201c verantwortlich. Zwischen seinen Solo-Aktivit\u00e4ten produziert Wilson in seinem legend\u00e4ren Analog-Studio Fivestar, das er 2009 vom Laurel Canyon nach Echo Park verlegt, verschiedene K\u00fcnstler wie Father John Misty, Conor Oberst, Roy Harper, The Deep Dark Woods und Dawes. Auf seinem aktuellen Werk \u201eRare Birds\u201c, es ist sein drittes, haben u.a. Lana Del Rey, Josh Tillman, Roger Waters-Bandkollege Lucius und Brian Eno-Sidekick Laraaji mitgewirkt.<p>\u00a0<p>Veranstalter: <a href=\"http://prime-entertainment.de/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prime Entertainment</a><br><br> \u00a0<p>Alle Vorverkaufspreise sind zzgl.

You&#39;d be hard pressed to find a comparison, or contemporary for that matter, that would do his recent work justice. -Josh TillmanTo say Jonathan Wilson plays many instruments well would be an understatement. He plays with a rare combination of extreme technical prowess and elusive soul. Maybe its his southern roots honed through many years as a session player and producer in LA or just some happy accident of nature but in any event it is a fantastic thing to witness. As a songwriter he is always exploring and pushing the limits while managing to remain a sturdy link to many of the most sacred elements that made thepsychedelic rock n roll of the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s so magical to begin with. -Conor Oberst Jonathan Wilsons new record brings together as much a poet as a man adept in the art of production. The result is yet another unplaceable album of sparkling timelessness. -Laura MarlingJonathan Wilson had a busy 2017, producing Father John Misty&#39;s grammy nominated Pure Comedyand touring arenas around the globe as a guitarist and vocalist for Pink Floyd legend Roger Waters (for whom he also contributed to the lauded IsThis The Life We Really Want?album.) Wilson also saw widespread acclaim heaped on Karen Elsons sophomore LP Double Roses,which he recorded with her in Los Angeles in 2016. But it&#39;s not looking like Wilson is going to get much of a rest in 2018 either, as he&#39;ll be continuing on with the worldwide Waters tour and is set to release his own new solo album Rare Birdsin the spring. The highly anticipated long player -which features backing vocals from Lana Del Rey, Josh Tillman, fellow Roger Waters bandmates Lucius and an extraordinary musical gift from otherworldly Brian Eno collaborator Laraaji-will be released throughBella Union worldwide.Although much of the album is comprised lyrically of meditations on a failed relationship and its aftermath, Wilson insists thatRare Birdsis not really a concept album. &quot;It&#39;s meant more as a healing affair, a rejuvenation, a reconciliation, for others, and for me. I wanted to balance personal narrative with the need I feel for calming healing music. I think we need journeys in sound, psychedelic gossamer-winged music that includes elements consciously and purposefully to incite hope, positivity, longing, reckless abandon and regret. It&#39;s all in there.&quot;And, for this one, music critics will need to retire the comparisons to heritage rockers and Laurel Canyon troubadours as theyre hardly useful anymore. Wilson&#39;s new sound takes a synthetic/acoustic, best-of-both-worlds analog/digital hybrid approach to achieve the complexity, sonic density and glossy hi-fi coating of Rare Birds. Heard for the first time on a Jonathan Wilson album are the sounds of synthesizers and drum machines.&quot;The Neil Young, CSN, Dennis Wilson and Tom Petty comparisons for the first two records were flattering, but I didn&#39;t ever really see it that way myself. The things that Wilson had been obsessing on, and he can clearly hear the influences of, are artists like Talk Talk, Arthur Russell, maybe a Sleigh Bells-meet-George Harrison kinda thing. I hear mostly ME actually. On this album Im quoting from earlier versions of myself, continuing a narrative Ive had musically since I got my first 4-track when I was thirteen. I hear the influence of my vocal coach. I hear the influence of having worked in my studio with Roger Waters for months during the same time period that I was making this record. That gave me the feeling I could expand into certain psychedelic and found sound labyrinths. There are voices, sirens, children playing, and more enhancing spatial sounds, while musical compadres Lana Del Rey and Josh Tillman(Father John Misty) appear as backing vocalists on Living With Myself and 49 Hairflips, respectively. Wilson describes Rare Birds as a &quot;maximalist,&quot; high density album more influenced by 80s British production more than anything to do with Southern California in 1970s. Its a dynamic new approach for Wilson that calls to mind one of Peter Gabriel&#39;s early solo albums or even mid-period Kate Bush. &quot;This album is a hell of a lot more Trevor Horn than anything, you know, Laurel Canyon-related,he adds. The song that started the whole record was Loving You. Says Wilson, I was floundering in mystudio pacing the floors for months, scratching my head for a clue to how I would embark upon the process of making Rare Birds.I was waiting on a sign, a catalyst. The catalyst came in the form of experimental ambient and new age musician Larajji.The pair had played together in the past, on the east coast, but its rare that Larajji is in Los Angeles and available to record. Wilson invited him to his Echo Park studio for few sessions. I had Loving You kicking around in a voice note on my phone for a while, something in it was my subtle ode to John Lennon...Larajii is one of the most musical humans I have ever come across, and every twist and turn he takes is documented here, it was not multiple passes, it was pure Larajji in the moment. I then went and sang a scratch vocal , which was always meant to be a scratch but Ill admit it had spirit so I left it all the way down the line. Wilson says simply of the song, its very authentic in that the longing was very real. Of Over The Midnight, the first track released from Rare Birds,Wilson says, I wanted to write a song about a sacred place for lovers to exist and I named that destination, process, mood or feeling Over the Midnight.Its a place where nothing is savage. In one of Wilsons favorite lines on the album he sings This world it is burning, but dont it feel incredible?/ Whisper in my ear and tell me what you see in the flames. &quot;On some of the songs with string sections, multiple layers of synths, guitars, vocals -all the movingparts -the track count may reach 120-150 tracks, he explains.What I invariably end up doing is setting up a punishing process of giving myself a sonic puzzle where I then have to sort out the relationships of all these ideas, these tracks, these frequencies. This is how I make all of my albums, and even records I produce for others always seem to have that same lush and layered orchestral component. I subject myself to many months of meditation really, figuring out why I was compelled to add this or that, and editing, getting to the essence of what I hear the song as. More and more thats maximalist, and big. And while the recording process is often complex, one of the albums most striking moments came together quickly. What you hear with Theres a Lightis the first time the song was ever played, says Wilson. I wrote it on my piano during the album tracking and we cut it the next day. This is the first take. Its completely the first time I ever sang the song in my life, and the drum take that Joey Waronkerput down blows my mind every time. Of Rare Birds as a whole Wilson says, I want my music to hit people like an emotional tidal wave. With my songwriting it&#39;s never about a clever couplet or smug turn of phrase, it&#39;s about the intensity, the impact. Besides, we&#39;re all fishing downstream from Townes Van Zandt anyway, so the onlything left to do is go BIG.&quot;****Rare Birds was produced by Jonathan Wilson.

You\u2019d be hard pressed to find a comparison, or contemporary for that matter, that would do his recent work justice.\u201d \u2013 Josh Tillman<p><p>\u201cTo say Jonathan Wilson plays many instruments well would be an understatement. He plays with a rare combination of extreme technical prowess and elusive soul. Maybe it\u2019s his southern roots honed through many years as a session player and producer in LA or just some happy accident of nature but in any event it is a fantastic thing to witness. As a songwriter he is always exploring and pushing the limits while managing to remain a sturdy link to many of the most sacred elements that made the psychedelic rock n roll of the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s so magical to begin with.\u201d \u2013 Conor Oberst<p>\u201cJonathan Wilson\u2019s new record brings together as much a poet as a man adept in the art of production. The result is yet another unplaceable album of sparkling timelessness.\u201d \u2013 Laura Marling<p>Jonathan Wilson had a busy 2017, producing Father John Misty\u2019s grammy nominated Pure Comedy and touring arenas around the globe as a guitarist and vocalist for Pink Floyd legend Roger Waters (for whom he also contributed to the lauded Is This The Life We Really Want? album.) Wilson also saw widespread acclaim heaped on Karen Elson\u2019s sophomore LP Double Roses, which he recorded with her in Los Angeles in 2016.<p>But it\u2019s not looking like Wilson is going to get much of a rest in 2018 either, as he\u2019ll be continuing with the worldwide Waters tour and is set to release his own new solo album Rare Birds in the spring. The highly anticipated long player \u2013 which features backing vocals from Lana Del Rey, Josh Tillman, fellow Roger Waters bandmates Lucius and an extraordinary musical gift from otherworldly Brian Eno collaborator Laraaji \u2013 will be released through Bella Union worldwide.<p><p>Although much of the album is comprised lyrically of meditations on a failed relationship and its aftermath, Wilson insists that Rare Birds is not really a concept album. \u201cIt\u2019s meant more as a healing affair, a rejuvenation, a reconciliation, for others, and for me. I wanted to balance personal narrative with the need I feel for calming healing music. I think we need journeys in sound, psychedelic gossamer-winged music that includes elements consciously and purposefully to incite hope, positivity, longing, reckless abandon and regret. It\u2019s all in there.\u201d And, for this one, music critics will need to retire the comparisons to heritage rockers and Laurel Canyon troubadours as they\u2019re hardly useful anymore. Wilson\u2019s new sound takes a synthetic/acoustic, best-of-both-worlds analog/digital hybrid approach to achieve the complexity, sonic density and glossy hi-fi coating of Rare Birds. Heard for the first time on a Jonathan Wilson album are the sounds of synthesizers and drum machines.<p>Wilson describes Rare Birds as a \u201cmaximalist,\u201d high density album more influenced by 80s British production more than anything to do with Southern California in 1970s. Of Rare Birds as a whole Wilson says, \u201cI want my music to hit people like an emotional tidal wave. With my song writing it\u2019s never about a clever couplet or smug turn of phrase, it\u2019s about the intensity, the impact.

Born Edward Larry Gordon in 1943 in Philadelphia, he studied violin, piano, trombone and voice in his early years in New Jersey. He attended Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C. on a scholarship to study composition and piano. After studying at Howard, he spent time in New York pursuing a career as a stand-up comedian and actor.\n\nIn the early seventies he began to study Eastern mysticism and believed he'd found a new path for his music and his life. It was also at this time he bought his first zither from a local pawn shop. Converting it to an electronic instrument, he began to experiment using the instrument like a piano. By 1978, he developed enough skill to begin busking in the parks and on the sidewalks of New York.\n\nThe following year he was \"discovered\" by Brian Eno while playing in Washington Square Park. The result was his most widely-recognized release, Ambient 3: Day of Radiance, the third instalment of Eno's Ambient series. This was his first album released under the name of Laraaji.\n\nThis international exposure led to many requests for longer versions of his compositions which he supplied to many meditation groups on cassette tapes. It also resulted in an expansion of his mystic studies with such gurus as Swami Satchidananda and Shri Brahmananda Sarasvati, founder of the Ananda Ashram in Monroe, New York.\n\nAnother product of Laraaji's increasing enlightenment was the creation of the Laughter Meditation Workshops which he still presents around the globe. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Laraaji\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A collection of great moments defines an amazing record. An avalanche of powerful moments tumbles into an engaging live show. The moment when band and fan become one and the same, the moment of interaction, is the type of moment that lasts forever.<br> Twenty years into its pioneering journey, Gainesville, Fla., natives Less Than Jake \u2013 comprised of lyricist/drummer Vinnie Fiorello, vocalist/guitarist Chris DeMakes, vocalist/bassist Roger Manganelli, saxophonist Peter \u201cJR\u201d Wasilewski, and trombonist Buddy Schaub \u2013 have had their fair share of moments. For a band obsessed with interacting with its fans, both online and after shows; for a band that is so concerned with making sure the fan gets the perfect experience, with well-known hijinks in every live performance; for a band with seemingly unlimited creativity in the form of physical products, from custom-made cereal boxes to unique vinyl packaging; and for a band that is so passionate when writing new music, 20 years begins to seem like an even longer amount of time. A lot of moments add up over two decades \u2013 teenagers grow into men over two decades \u2013 dare we say, things change?<br> Ever-adapting to the constant change in an unsure music industry, Less Than Jake is still making cannonball-sized splashes in the deep end while many of its peers timidly eye shallow waters. With the release of Greetings And Salutations this sentiment is as true as ever. The twelve-track release recorded at The Moathouse in Gainesville and produced by Less Than Jake\u2019s own Roger Lima, includes both limited edition EP\u2019s Season\u2019s Greetings and Greetings From Less Than Jake plus two unreleased songs.<br> The twelve tracks are pure unfiltered LTJ, Sunny ska mixed with barn-burner punk rock, more intended to get long-time fans and first-time listeners warmed up and moshing in their living rooms and singing along to every lyric. Keeping its signature mix of punk roots and horn-driven melodies, songs like \u201cA Return To Headphones\u201d and \u201cFiner Points of Forgiveness\u201d take the best of old-school Less Than Jake and put on a fresh coat of paint for an amped-up listening experience.<br> Drummer Vinnie Fiorello puts the release into perspective \u201cWe had been writing music in short creative bursts for the last year but looking back at all the songs they wound up more of a cohesive thought, following the moods of the seasons of the year, from the winter through the summer. Greetings And Salutations is as much moody and tense as it is casual and laid back\u2026\u201d<br> Greetings And Salutations is the follow up to 2010\u2019s TV/EP and the band\u2019s last full-length, 2008\u2019s GNV FLA and is being released in Europe and the UK via Rude Records on October 16th. With the rest of the year of worldwide touring ahead, the group is still following through on its mission to please the fan, wherever the fan may be. More so than many bands that have been doing this for so long, Less Than Jake continues to provide output that loyal fans love. From a 16-minute EP of TV theme show cover songs to re-releases of their classic back catalog to live shows of genre staples Losing Streak or Hello Rockview in their entirety, Less Than Jake has done it all. Less Than Jake will continue to do it all.<br> \u201cWe\u2019re constantly pushing ourselves to come up with new ways to present the band,\u201d says Schaub, \u201cwhether it be within the writing of our songs, ideas for keeping our live shows fresh, coming up with crazy new merch ideas, or just coming up with the best joke in the van. Keeping your band new and innovative is the key to lasting around for more than a minute in the minds of fans.\u201d<br> As the release of Greetings And Salutations proves, this isn\u2019t a band content to rest on the laurels of past success. In fact, 2012 is more about pushing forward and breaking new ground, rather than contemplatively reflecting on the success of yesteryear. A constantly innovative force in the industry, DeMakes says the band has managed to stay around so long by staying true to themselves. \u201cTwenty years of blood, sweat and beers,\u201d DeMakes says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a privilege and a pleasure. We have survived more trends than we can count and have managed, so far, to leave a legacy of music two decades long.</p>", "title": "LESS THAN JAKEFOUR YEAR STRONG, DIRECT HIT, & BEARINGS", "url": "http://jacksonville.eventful.com/events/less-than-jakefour-year-strong-direct-hit-/E0-001-109214541-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Jack Rabbits", "date": "2018-02-12 18:30:00"}, {"city": "Letchworth", "description": " Come down to Thai Food Direct for special offers and family activities!

This start led him into many other genres of electronic music such as Drum n' Bass. Artists such as Danny Byrd and Logistics inspired him and drove him to make that style of music. When entering high school a few of his friends showed him dubstep and he began by writing and producing dubstep music.\n\n2) There was also a band on the New Breed Comp called Direct. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Direct\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Howard Jones (born John Howard Jones on February 23, 1955) is an English singer and songwriter.\n\nHe is the eldest of three boys. His birthplace is Southampton, England, and he spent his early years in High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, and attended the Royal Grammar School. He now lives with his family in Somerset, England.\n\nWhen he was young, he used to give piano lessons. One of his clients was a girl named Jan Smith, who he later married. Whilst working with her, a vehicle crashed into their van, injuring Jan. She claimed compensation and used the money to buy Howard a synthesiser, Moog Prodigy. The shop delivered two by mistake, and Howard liked the combination of the two so much that he paid for the extra one.\n\nHe hit the charts in 1983 with a song called \"New Song,\" which made it into the UK top ten. Speaking with Songfacts, Jones explained the song is his manifesto, and why he wanted to get in the music business and write songs to begin with. Said Jones: \"I was working in the factory at the time - I was doing the gigs at night and I was working in the factory. And I wanted to say to people, 'You can. It is possible to do what you really want to do if you've got enough guts and determination. You can do what you're really good at in this life if you set your mind to it.' And so really that's what that song's about. It's about letting go of fear and seeing both sides of an argument and throwing off the things that hold you back mentally.\"\n\nJones subsequently had three more hits over the next twelve months and a UK Number 1 album, Human's Lib. He acquired a hardcore fanbase made up of both starstruck teenagers and more mature music lovers, who saw the musicianship which went into the electronic sounds of his songs. His mother ran his fan club. Jones was a close temporal and stylistic contemporary of Nik Kershaw, and the two musicians were often conflated in the affections of the contemporary pop audience.\n\nHoward was known as a respectable face of pop, combining innovative synthesiser music with strong feelings on animal rights and life's excesses. In his early days, he performed with a mime artist called Jed Hoile, who used to do improvised choreography while doused in white paint as Howard played behind him.\n\nIn the summer of 1984, he released a single called \"Like To Get To Know You Well\", which he said was 'dedicated to the original spirit of the Olympic Games'. Although it wasn't an official Olympic anthem for the Games in Los Angeles that summer, it caught on and was a huge worldwide hit. The sleeve featured the song title in ten different languages; while Howard sang the title line in French and German on the extended version. The song appeared in the film Better Off Dead.\n\nHoward's second album was a ground breaking 'remix' album. It contained six songs, all but one of which had been previously released, but which appeared in elongated formats, including the multi-lingual version of \"Like To Get To Know You Well\". The album was called The 12 Inch Album and the sleeve featured a miniature Howard standing next to a 12-inch ruler.\n\nWhen he released his second studio album, Dream Into Action, in 1985, he introduced his own backing band, including future Soul II Soul singer Caron Wheeler as one third of female backing vocal trio Afrodiziak. Playing bass guitar, meanwhile, was Howard's own brother Martin, who had to have an extra string added to his instrument to play some of Howard's bass lines, which were originally played on a keyboard without regard for the range of a real bass guitar. One of the singles released from this album, \"No One Is To Blame\", was later re-recorded and featured Phil Collins as drummer and producer.\n\nIn July 1985, Howard performed at Wembley Stadium as part of the Live Aid concert, singing his 1984 hit \"Hide And Seek\" while playing a piano belonging to Freddie Mercury.\n\nHoward had his last UK Top 40 hit in 1986 and thereafter concentrated on production, songwriting and running a successful vegetarian restaurant, though he had Billboard Top 10 success in the States in the 1990s. His eldest son, Ois\u00edn (pronounced Osheen), was born in 1985 and is now an actor.\n\nIn 2005, he competed on the American TV show Hit Me Baby One More Time, losing to Irene Cara. Although he lost the in-studio vote to Cara, he won the online poll vote.\n\n\n\n2. Howard Jones is the current lead singer of American metalcore bands Killswitch Engage and Blood Has Been Shed.\n\nJones resides in Connecticut. His first success was in Connecticut with the band Blood Has Been Shed. After the release of The Novella of Uriel, the band went on tour, but Jones was eventually approached for a bigger project. Howard Jones replaced the lead singer of Killswitch Engage, Jesse Leach, in July of 2002, shortly after the release of Alive or Just Breathing, Killswitch Engage's Roadrunner Records debut album.\n\nMeanwhile, Blood Has Been Shed released their third album, Spirals in 2003. Critical reviews were mixed, with some saying the album was a bit stray from the music found on I Dwell and Novella, while fans found it to be the band's most sonically-challenging album yet.\n\nThe first time KSE fans heard Jones they were impressed by him. Later he would be heard on the song \"When Darkness Falls\", which was first released on the soundtrack for the movie Freddy vs. Jason. Finally, Killswitch Engage released their first album with Jones as the new singer, as well as Blood Has Been Shed drummer Justin Foley. The End of Heartache would spawn two successful singles, \"Rose of Sharyn\" and the Grammy-nominated title track, \"The End of Heartache\". There was a minor spot of controversy with some fans over the Grammy nomination, as the song that was picked was a remixed version that would eventually appear on the Resident Evil: Apocalypse soundtrack. The differences between the original recording and the remixed version are the fact that the song is sung in a traditional singing style rather than using the original scream track that appears on the album, and several sections of the song have been shortened for a more commercially dynamic vision.\n\nIn November 2006, Killswitch Engage released their fourth album (and second with Howard Jones) entitled As Daylight Dies. The album has spawned the singles \"My Curse\" and \"Arms of Sorrow\", and it has been cited by the band through numerous interviews that the album recalls influences from bands in the NOLA music scene, as well as metal bands like Pantera and Machine Head.\n\nDespite his front man role in Killswitch Engage, Jones is still the lead singer for Blood Has Been Shed.\n\nAside from singing, Jones has also taken on the role of a manager to new and upcoming artists. Currently, he manages two bands, Twelve Tribes, Mikoto, and also the producer Zeuss.\n\nHe is also known for his vocal styles, which include deep, booming roars, a higher, raspier scream, and operatic clean vocals. The clean style is absent from most of his work with Blood Has Been Shed, however, with Killswitch Engage, he usually makes use of all of his vocal styles in almost every song, particularly in As Daylight Dies and Holy Diver.\n\n3.  Howard Jones is an English folk singer and musician.  He was a member of The Electropathics  and currently performs with Albireo and as a solo performer. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Howard+Jones\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

From Spanish, it translates to &quot;please,&quot; a word that suggests a need for something, a desire to make a change. &quot;Por favor&#39; was something I kept saying every day in the studio, and I got the other musicians saying it,&quot; says Brett Dennen. &quot;We were goofing around, and Dave Cobb, my producer, said it should be the title of my new record. I laughed it off at first, but then I really thought about it.&quot;&quot;When you say please, you&#39;re asking something to come into your life,&quot; Dennen adds. &quot;It might mean that you&#39;re weak and need something to make you strong. But you&#39;re admitting to some sort of weakness or some form of humility.&quot;That notion is at the heart of Por Favor, Dennen&#39;s intimate and revealing new album that Elektra Records will release on May 20. Produced by Cobb, fresh from his Grammywinning work with Chris Stapleton and Jason Isbell, the record strips Dennen to his core as a songwriter with nothing to hide.&quot;All these songs came from a time of sadness for lots of different reasons. They came at a point when I wasn&#39;t feeling confident about myself,&quot; he says. &quot;When I&#39;m not feeling confident, I&#39;m not a nice person to be around. I don&#39;t take care of my health, my relationships, my stuff, and it all cycles into a miserable place. And I have a really hard time admitting that I&#39;m in that place.&quot;A followup to 2013&#39;s Smoke and Mirrors, his sixth studio album dives deep into loneliness, loss, and love and all its side effects. It&#39;s the sound of an artist working through his insecurities in song, and thereby letting go of them. But it&#39;s by no means a sad affair, nor is it the &quot;rainyday record&quot; Dennen initially thought he was making.Often framed by uplifting choruses and bright acoustic arrangements, these songs brim with optimism, the palpable sense that the tide is turning. &quot;And I want to love you for the way you are/ Not the way I am/ So let&#39;s go now/ Back to the bonfire where we began,&quot; he sings over a chugging groove on &quot;Bonfire.&quot;On &quot;Where We Left Off,&quot; the album&#39;s emotional powder keg, Dennen lays himself bare over the slack strum of guitar and one of his most unvarnished vocals ever recorded. The opening lines go straight for the jugular: &quot;Everyone knows I&#39;m a happy man/ But I haven&#39;t been right.&quot;&quot;Vulnerable was another word that kept coming up when I was making this record,&quot; Dennen admits. &quot;Is there something I&#39;m scared to say? Can I dig a little deeper, reveal a little bit more? How far can I go That was my direction, and once I got that in place, I started shooting down things that weren&#39;t in that zone.&quot;&quot;I kept telling myself that all I have to do is be authentic and make the songs about the lyrics and how they interact with my guitar,&quot; he continues. &quot;I don&#39;t have to worry about whether they&#39;ll be on the radio or if they&#39;re different from my previous stuff.&quot;Holed up at Cobb&#39;s Nashville studio, with musicians the producer assembled, Dennen and Cobb worked fast and kept the songs rough around the edges. Dennen appreciated Cobb&#39;s insistence on capturing them in just a few takes. &quot;We recorded it the way people made records in the &#39;60s - really fast, all on analog gear, very few rehearsals,&quot; he says. &quot;We didn&#39;t do anything more than five times. We didn&#39;t secondguess ourselves - we just went with it. It&#39;s not sloppy, but it&#39;s in that right place between loose and tight and feelgood but not labored.&quot;Cobb adds, &quot;I worked with Brett because of his beautiful balance of wit and melody. He&#39;s very timeless in his writing and you really can hear his personality in every note he sings. The record was made totally live and we recorded all the vocals live with the band.

From Spanish, it translates to &quot;please,&quot; a word that suggests a need for something, a desire to make a change. &quot;Por favor&#39; was something I kept saying every day in the studio, and I got the other musicians saying it,&quot; says Brett Dennen. &quot;We were goofing around, and Dave Cobb, my producer, said it should be the title of my new record. I laughed it off at first, but then I really thought about it.&quot;&quot;When you say please, you&#39;re asking something to come into your life,&quot; Dennen adds. &quot;It might mean that you&#39;re weak and need something to make you strong. But you&#39;re admitting to some sort of weakness or some form of humility.&quot;That notion is at the heart of Por Favor, Dennen&#39;s intimate and revealing new album that Elektra Records will release on May 20. Produced by Cobb, fresh from his Grammywinning work with Chris Stapleton and Jason Isbell, the record strips Dennen to his core as a songwriter with nothing to hide.&quot;All these songs came from a time of sadness for lots of different reasons. They came at a point when I wasn&#39;t feeling confident about myself,&quot; he says. &quot;When I&#39;m not feeling confident, I&#39;m not a nice person to be around. I don&#39;t take care of my health, my relationships, my stuff, and it all cycles into a miserable place. And I have a really hard time admitting that I&#39;m in that place.&quot;A followup to 2013&#39;s Smoke and Mirrors, his sixth studio album dives deep into loneliness, loss, and love and all its side effects. It&#39;s the sound of an artist working through his insecurities in song, and thereby letting go of them. But it&#39;s by no means a sad affair, nor is it the &quot;rainyday record&quot; Dennen initially thought he was making.Often framed by uplifting choruses and bright acoustic arrangements, these songs brim with optimism, the palpable sense that the tide is turning. &quot;And I want to love you for the way you are/ Not the way I am/ So let&#39;s go now/ Back to the bonfire where we began,&quot; he sings over a chugging groove on &quot;Bonfire.&quot;On &quot;Where We Left Off,&quot; the album&#39;s emotional powder keg, Dennen lays himself bare over the slack strum of guitar and one of his most unvarnished vocals ever recorded. The opening lines go straight for the jugular: &quot;Everyone knows I&#39;m a happy man/ But I haven&#39;t been right.&quot;&quot;Vulnerable was another word that kept coming up when I was making this record,&quot; Dennen admits. &quot;Is there something I&#39;m scared to say? Can I dig a little deeper, reveal a little bit more? How far can I go That was my direction, and once I got that in place, I started shooting down things that weren&#39;t in that zone.&quot;&quot;I kept telling myself that all I have to do is be authentic and make the songs about the lyrics and how they interact with my guitar,&quot; he continues. &quot;I don&#39;t have to worry about whether they&#39;ll be on the radio or if they&#39;re different from my previous stuff.&quot;Holed up at Cobb&#39;s Nashville studio, with musicians the producer assembled, Dennen and Cobb worked fast and kept the songs rough around the edges. Dennen appreciated Cobb&#39;s insistence on capturing them in just a few takes. &quot;We recorded it the way people made records in the &#39;60s - really fast, all on analog gear, very few rehearsals,&quot; he says. &quot;We didn&#39;t do anything more than five times. We didn&#39;t secondguess ourselves - we just went with it. It&#39;s not sloppy, but it&#39;s in that right place between loose and tight and feelgood but not labored.&quot;Cobb adds, &quot;I worked with Brett because of his beautiful balance of wit and melody. He&#39;s very timeless in his writing and you really can hear his personality in every note he sings. The record was made totally live and we recorded all the vocals live with the band. It really was produced as stopped down as possible - we tried to make every note matter.&quot;More than a decade after his selftitled debut catapulted him to stardom, Dennen was once again attracted to how he made his earliest recordings. &quot;My whole approach was that I wanted to write and sing the songs from the same place that I wrote the first record, which was a place of trying to discover who I am,&quot; he says.That marked a detour from his most recent releases.

As a thank you to these loyal supporters, SYF is proud to once again help a graduating senior living near Lighthouse Place Premium Outlets take the next step on their educational journey.\n \nEach year, Simon Youth Community Scholarships are awarded in every community across the country that is home to a Simon Mall, Mills, or Premium Outlets center. The application period has begun and ends on February 15, 2018. Students can apply online by visiting syf.org/scholarships.\n \nAny student who will be graduating in the class of 2018 and lives in the designated community surrounding a Simon property is eligible. Applicants can check their eligibility by entering their ZIP code at syf.org/scholarships. Recipients will receive up to $1,500 toward tuition and other educational expenses at an accredited college, university, vocational or technical school.\n \nThe SYF community scholarship program is one facet of the Simon Supports Education initiative, launched earlier this spring at all Simon properties. As part of this initiative, visitors at Simon centers can now purchase SYF Simon VISA gift cards, redeemable wherever VISA is accepted. One dollar from the sale of each bright orange, SYF-branded card will go directly to support SYF and its mission.\n \n\u201cThe support of Simon and its generous shoppers has been instrumental in the growth and overall impact of Simon Youth Foundation,\u201d said Dr. J. Michael Durnil, SYF President and CEO. \u201cProviding this scholarship to deserving students in communities that Simon calls home is our way of saying \u2018thank you\u2019 for their continued support.\u201d\n \nIn addition to the community scholarships, 11 regional awards called \u201cAwards of Excellence\u201d will be given to top candidates. The regions eligible are Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Indianapolis, Miami, New York, Orange County (CA), Orlando, and Seattle/Tacoma. Additionally, one Award of Excellence will be awarded to an applicant from a Simon Premium Outlet. Students from these areas will have the opportunity to receive a $10,000 award ($2,500 for up to four years).\n \nIn 2017, the Simon Youth Foundation awarded $1.6 million to 335 students nationwide.\n \n\u201cThe importance of pursuing education\u2014both high school and beyond\u2014cannot be overstated, and we feel passionately that financial constraints should never be the reason that a promising student is unable to achieve their dreams,\u201d said Durnil. \u201cWe are proud to partner with Lighthouse Place Premium Outlets to help a Michigan City-area student take their next steps in life.\u201d\n \nThe 2018 SYF Community Scholarship recipients will be selected by International Scholarship and Tuition Services, Inc. (ISTS), a third-party administrator. Students are selected based on a variety of criteria, including financial need, academic performance, leadership skills and participation in school and community activities. Those students who are the first in their family to pursue a post secondary education will also be given close consideration.\n \nRecipients will be notified of their awards in May 2018.\n \nAbout SYF\nSYF is a national non-profit that partners with public school districts to open dropout recovery academies inside Simon shopping malls. The organization now has 30 Simon Youth Academies in 12 states. In the organization\u2019s 19-year history, nearly 16,000 students have earned their diploma and more than $17 million in scholarships have been awarded.

This year\u2019s Conch Revival Picnic \u2013 the third so far - begins with a wine and appetizer pairing and music by Chilean guitarist Rolando Rojas from 5:00pm-6:00pm, followed by a 6:00-8:00pm dinner of classic Key West/Conch recipes featuring produce grown at Grimal Grove, the historic two-acre Big Pine tropical fruit park dedicated to the local food movement. \u201cWe are pleased to include Grimal Grove in this year\u2019s picnic and hope to raise the funds necessary to help them rebuild\u00a0the landscape they had worked so diligently to revitalize before Irma hit,\u201d says Society Executive Director Michael Gieda. Inspired by The Society\u2019s board member the late Dianne Zolotow, the Conch Revival Picnic tradition was launched in 2016 to increase awareness of Key West/Conch culture by preserving and promoting historic recipes created and consumed by Conch families for generations, but which have, over time, been disappearing from memory and tables. Some of the recipes presented are inspired by the postwar Key West Woman\u2019s Club Cookbook edited by original Conch and first Florida Keys woman mayor Wilhelmina Harvey, as well as recipes from other books located in the Key West Public Library collection.\u00a0On January 24th, Hubbard and Furman will present a feast that highlights alligator pear salad, shrimp and grits, whole pig and fish roast, with traditional Conch sides and sauces.\u00a0 Key West Food Tours creator Analise Smith returns as coordinator of the Picnic\u2019s Conch Cook-off \u2013 with this year\u2019s competition for Conch cooks being focused on \u201cmollettes,\u201d a savory flatbread that in Key West has become synonymous with a sandwich-sized piece of battered and deep-fried Cuban bread stuffed with picadillo.\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFolklore notes that long ago, Key West locals suffered a poor economy and not even potatoes were available to make the beloved\u00a0Papa Rellenas\u00a0(mashed potato balls stuffed with picadillo, battered and deep fried),\u201d says Smith, who was raised in a household with a strong emphasis on evening family meals that merged Cuban cuisine with Conch-inspired recipes.\u00a0 \u201cBut given that necessity is the mother of invention, the Conchs decided to slice their loaf of Cuban into 4-5 sandwich size pieces, and then prepare the sandwich like the Papa Rellena by stuffing, breading, and deep frying.\u201d Five entrants\u2014Collen Mellies, Hank Kokenzie, Stewart Andrews, and two others yet to be announced\u2014were recommended by the Key West Conch community as Mollette masters, with recipes that have been in the family for decades. Each will receive $100 to cover ingredient expenses and event entrance, vying for the winning title and cash-prize kitty. Judges will consist of the Conch Revival chefs, Smith and her Cuban-Conch recipe aficionada mother Teresa Menendez, and any Conch Revival attendee willing to pay a small token fee towards the kitty.\u00a0 \u00a0 The picnic is sponsored by Great Events, Southern Glazer\u2019s Wine and Spirits, Fausto\u2019s, Three Hands Fish, and Key West Food Tours.\u00a0 Visit\u00a0KWAHS.ORG\u00a0to purchase your ticket\u2014$35 for Society Members and $45 for Non-members.\u00a0 For more information, contact Operations Manager Shawn Cowles at\u00a0scowles@kwahs.org\u00a0or 305.295.6616 x111.\u00a0Your Museums.\u00a0 Your Community.\u00a0 It takes an Island.\u00a0 \u00a0 ", "title": "Conch Revival Picnic", "url": "http://eventful.com/keywest/events/conch-revival-picnic-/E0-001-110004549-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Key West Lighthouse", "date": "2018-01-24 17:00:00"}, {"city": "Beach Haven", "description": " We&#39;re Turning 10!

What would it be like to live on other planets? How can mould solve mazes? What do cells look like? Join us for Big Little Multiverse to peer through the telescope \u2013 and the microscope \u2013 to find out. As part of the\u00a0Brighton Science Festival, Lighthouse\u2019s\u00a0Big Little Multiverse\u00a0screens short films that explore the universe and humanity\u2019s place within it, telling the stories of those who have ventured into its vastness and marvelled at its scale. Get experimentingAs well as space exploration we\u2019ll be examining the tiniest parts of our universe.\u00a0Our experiments run throughout the afternoons, and are a chance to get hands-on with science. Sessions include:\u00a0 Extract\u00a0DNA\u00a0from a kiwi (Friday 16 February):\u00a0What makes a kiwi a kiwi? It\u2019s all coded in its\u00a0DNA. In this simple fun experiment, you can isolate the\u00a0DNA\u00a0and see it for yourself. Build a model cell (Thursday 15 and Sunday 18 February):\u00a0Get inside the smallest building blocks of all living things by making your own plant or animal 3D cell. Intelligent slime (Wednesday 14 and Saturday 17 February):\u00a0Slime mould \u2013 sounds disgusting, but these organisms are incredibly smart. Despite not having a brain they are able to make complex decisions, allowing them to find their way through mazes and replicate man-made transport systems. Find out for yourself by testing which substances act as obstacles for the mould to navigate around. Digital Q&AsThroughout the week, we\u2019ll be hosting live online Q&A\u2019s with scientists, philosophers, astronomers, physicists, artists, filmmakers and designers. FilmsAll five films will be screened on a loop each day \u2013 just take a seat and marvel at the wonder of the universe. A Pale Blue Dot, 2012 (2 min)On February 14 1990, the space probe Voyager 1 took a photo of Earth from a record distance of over 4 billion miles. This film visualises astronomer, scientist, and part of the voyager imaging team, Carl Sagan\u2019s famed monologue on our place in the universe \u2013 as a pale blue dot. Overview, 2012 (20 min)How does travelling into Space transform our perspective of the planet and mankind? Through interviews with five astronauts, this short film explores the so-called \u2018Overview Effect\u2019, where astronauts experience feelings of awe, a profound understanding of the interconnectedness of life and a renewed sense of responsibility for taking care of the environment. The Purple Plain, 2016 (12 min)The Purple Plain is inspired by the true story of the Mercury 13, the first American women to be tested for space flight \u2013 but who never went into space. This film is rooted in their battle, not just against\u00a0NASA\u00a0and male peers, but the entire social system of the early 1960s. Orbit Ever After, 2012 (20 min)Nigel lives on a dilapidated spacecraft orbiting the earth. He has fallen in love. But there\u2019s a problem \u2013 the object of his affections is orbiting the planet in the opposite direction.

They consist of vocalist Tunde Baiyewu (born November 25, 1968 in London) and keyboard player Paul Tucker, (born 12 August 1968, in Crystal Palace, London) and formed in 1993 in Newcastle upon Tyne, England after meeting at college. Their 1995 debut album Ocean Drive sold more than 1.6 million copies in the UK alone and established them as a popular easy listening duo throughout Europe.\n\nThe Lighthouse Family split up in early 2003 due to \"a heavy promotional schedule and the incredible international success of 'Whatever Gets You Through The Day'.\" This led to both men pursuing individual projects. Tunde has embarked on a solo career, and has already released an album called Tunde in late 2004, while Tucker joined a rock band, The Orange Lights. According to their management, the band has not split up despite being inactive: \"there is always the possibility of another Lighthouse Family album one day.\"\n\nBoth Baiyewu and Tucker were working in bars when they first met; together, they recorded demos of a number of songs Tucker had written during the late 1980s. Among these, a demo of \"Ocean Drive\" attracted the attention of Polydor Records A&R director Colin Barlow, who, in 1993, signed the band to a six-month development deal.\n\nThe band were funded for the recording of additional demos, and teamed with songwriters Martin Brammer (formerly of Kane Gang), Tim Kellett (formerly of Simply Red), and Tim Laws (co-writer of \"Dreams\" by Gabrielle). Eventually, the band was signed to record an album proper; finished in August 1994, Ocean Drive also included songs written by Shaun Ward (also of Simply Red), Junior Giscombe, and Alan Glass, and was produced by Mike Peden.\n\nThe band was managed throughout its career by Keith Armstrong and Phil Mitchell, co-founders of Newcastle-based Kitchenware Records; the label had gone on hiatus during the 1990s in order to handle the management of Lighthouse Family and other musicians.\n\nIn the wake of an economic recession in the UK, British record labels were, at the time, primarily signing artists with the goal of short-term profit. In contrast, Barlow, in The Times, expected that the band could last for \"ten years or more\". At the time of the launch of the first album, Polydor's investments in the band totaled \u20a4250,000. Peden's hiring was described as a \"big spend\", and music videos were filmed overseas in Los Angeles and Las Vegas.\n\nThe lead single, \"Lifted\", received airplay on BBC Radio One as well as a number of BBC Local Radio stations, and The Chart Show aired its music video. Still, this did not translate to considerable single or album sales within 1995; it wasn't until \"Lifted\" was re-released in 1996 that it reached the top five on the UK Singles Chart, and Ocean Drive, which had been deleted, rebounded and was certified six-times platinum by the end of 1997. Its follow-up, \"Postcards from Heaven\", achieved similar sales status in 1998.\n\nIn 2010, The Lighthouse Family reformed. The band accounced tour details for 2011, as well as a new album coming up.\n\n[wikipedia] <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lighthouse+Family\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Popular releases by Headhunterz are 'Rock Civilization', 'Forever Az One' and 'End of my Existence'. \n\nHowever even more recently, Rebergen teamed up with upcoming Scantraxx talent Wildstylez and created what might be the most anticipated hardstyle album ever: Project One (album and artist name). After a delay of several months, it was finally released in the first few days of July 2008. Even though most of the tracks were already well-known as every supposed Project One track played at an event spread through internet communities like a wildfire, the album was still in great demand. It will probably remain popular over the course of the next few months as the tracks are released on vinyl two by two, and will thus be continuously heard on events and parties. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Headhunterz\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Leno, Letterman, Conan, Ferguson and so on. Her third hour-long special, Madigan Again, which iTunes named one of the Best Comedy Albums of 2013, premiered on September 11 exclusively on Netflix in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Latin America, and is now available on CD, DVD and audio or video download. Previously she&#39;s released 4 CDs and 2 DVDs and starred in 2 HBO specials, 3 Comedy Central specials, 3 CMT Salute to the Troops specials with Ron White and her last hour-long special, Gone Madigan, premiered on Showtime and is available on Netflix.So how is it, the Detroit Free Press asks, &quot;that Madigan has yet to be cast as the wise-cracking a) best friend b) office worker or c) martini-swilling mother-in-law in any of countless sitcoms? We&#39;re thinking because it&#39;s because she&#39;s so irreplaceable on the stage. She&#39;s described as the funniest woman doing stand-up right now, but no gender qualifier is necessary. Along with Lewis Black, Brian Regan and Jim Gaffigan, she&#39;s one of the funniest stand-up comedians of her generation.&quot; &quot;I just want to tell jokes. I didn&#39;t start doing open mics to become an actor on a sitcom or in a tv commercial. Those things never even crossed my mind. I just like to tell jokes for an hour or so and laugh,&quot; Madigan says. &quot;For a few of us working today, this was our goal. We don&#39;t have anymore goals. Can&#39;t you ever have a goal, reach it and then enjoy it? This society is being driven by type A lunatics that say &#39;you have to set more goals.&#39; No you don&#39;t. Have a seat and enjoy the fact that you&#39;re here! Maybe that&#39;s the Irish in me talking though.&quot; It&#39;s been a 25 year career of 300 nights a year on the road. &quot;We don&#39;t get time off like a band. Our tours never end. That&#39;s why it makes me laugh when people say &#39;how long is your tour?&#39; Well so far, 25 years.&quot; She&#39;s gone from one nighters, to club gigs, to theaters, to headlining the Mirage in Las Vegas. -more- 2-2-2-2 Madigan Biography She&#39;s won the American Comedy Award for &quot;Best Female Comedian&quot; and the Phyllis Diller award for &quot;Best Female Comedian.&quot; Although she&#39;s turned down many writing jobs because she enjoys performing more, she has written and produced for Lewis Black&#39;s &quot;Root of all Evil&quot; on Comedy Central and for Gary Shandling&#39;s Emmy monologues. She&#39;s done two USO tours to Iraq and Afganistan with pals Lewis Black, Robin Williams, John Bowman and musicals acts Kid Rock, The Zac Brown Band, Kix Brooks and Kellie Pickler. &quot;There&#39;s no better show on earth than a show for the troops. Trust me, no crowd is as happy to see a show as 1000 soldiers in Kabul. I do USO shows at home here in the US too but the further people are away, the more they appreciate it. I don&#39;t think they get paid enough for a hard job so I like to do something for free when I can.&quot; She remains the only comedian in the history of NBC&#39;s Last Comic Standing to go unchallenged by any other comedian--meaning no comedian would say they were funnier than her. Madigan was a top three finalist in Season 2 and and a judge on Season 5. She&#39;s a favorite on nationally syndicated radio shows such as the The Bob and Tom Show and The Stephanie Miller Show. She&#39;s also in constant rotation on SIRIUS-XM Radio and is repeated voted #1 audience favorite by listeners.

The 21-year-old Pickler auditioned for American Idol in the fall of 2005 in Greensboro, North Carolina. She sang both Kelly Clarkson's \"Since U Been Gone\" and Martina McBride's \"A Broken Wing\". The judges unanimously sent her to Hollywood. Pickler advanced through the semi-finalist rounds in February and March, reaching the Top 12 On March 9.\n\nPickler gained attention on the show by saying (for example) that she had never performed before real audiences, pronouncing \"salmon\" as \"sal-mon\", and confusing \"minx\" with \"mink \". She was compared to Jessica Simpson in a March 27 story in US Weekly magazine entitled \"Kellie: The Next Jessica Simpson\", due to her \"sweet southern style and ditzy demeanor.\" Various Internet blogs alleged that Pickler was merely putting on an act in order to win votes. Host Ryan Seacrest asked Pickler about the allegations during the April 4 broadcast, and she denied the claims. On April 19, Pickler and contestant Taylor Hicks became the only contestants among the rest of the Top 6 to never be in the bottom 3. That changed on April 26 when she was in the bottom 2 and then eliminated. Due to time constraints, her exit performance was not aired on the show, which happened to be the first time of its kind in American Idol history. However, when Kellie was interviewed by Extra, they showed her exit performance for the first time.\n\nShe returned in the finale in a pre-taped segment called \"Puck 'n Pickler\", featuring her and Wolfgang Puck at a restaurant discussing foods. It has scenes of Pickler mispronouncing Shanghai, her use of sarcasm, and her reaction to lobsters.\nFate played the straight man, and since then she's never looked back. \n\nOn September 30, 2008 Kellie released her 2nd studio album. It was self-titled because she felt she had more to do with the making of it therefore it reflected her as an artist better than her first album. The self-titled album has yielded 4 singles: \"Don't You Know You're Beautiful\" which peaked at #21, \"Best Days of Your Life\" at #9 (This was her first top 10), \"Didn't You Know How Much I Loved You\" at #14, and \"Makin' Me Fall In Love Again\".\n\nSongfacts states that \"Tough,\" Kellie Pickler's first single from her third album is a female anthem, which finds the song's narrator declaring that while she is just a regular girl, she has been able to overcome challenges in her life by staying tough. The song was released on June 13, 2011.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kellie+Pickler\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The other members of the band's classic lineup included bassist Barry Adamson, keyboardist Dave Formula, and drummer John Doyle.  The band burst onto the scene with the single Shot by Both Sides and released four albums before disbanding in 1981. In 2009 the band resurfaced for half a dozen live performances in the UK, with Noko (who collaborated with Devoto in the late 80s in Luxuria) filling the position of guitarist. These performances, which earned very favourable reviews, took place in February in Manchester, London and Glasgow.  Later the same year there were more festival appearances.\nin 2011 Magazine returned with their first new recorded material from the band in 30 years, though Adamson had left the reunion by this point.\n\nMagazine's music continues to be an influence in modern music today. While having roots in the punk and new-wave movements, Magazine combined elements of avant-garde and pop. Radiohead in particular draws on the lyrical style of the group, and have performed \"Shot By Both Sides\" in concert. What's more, Radiohead's 1995 single \"Just\", with its ascending guitar hook, bears a passing resemblance to \"Shot By Both Sides\". Former Smiths singer Morrissey, a fan and acquaintance of Devoto's, covered \"A Song From Under The Floorboards\" as a B-side to his 2006 single \"The Youngest Was the Most Loved\". \"Floorboards\" was covered by My Friend The Chocolate Cake on their 1994 album Brood. Half Man Half Biscuit have performed live covers of a number of Magazine songs. \"The Light Pours Out Of Me\", from the album Real Life, has been covered by both Peter Murphy and Ministry. Swedish punk band No Fun At All did a cover of \"Shot By Both Sides\" on their record \"And Now For Something Completely Different\". Devoto co-wrote two songs with Mansun, \"Everyone Must Win\" and \"Railings\", contributing vocals to the latter, and the band later covered \"Shot By Both Sides\" for John Peel.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine_%28band%29\nhttp://www.discogs.com/artist/26054-Magazine\nhttp://www.wire-sound.com/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/officialmagazine\n\n\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Magazine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

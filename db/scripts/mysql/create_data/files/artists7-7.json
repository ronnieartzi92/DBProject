Louie is up for the award for best Remixer for his production work on one of the House Music anthems of 2017 - Loleatta Holloway / Can&#39;t Let You Go. This will be THE ESSENTIAL, GO-TO PARTY in NYC for everyone in the industry and beyond who loves music and nightlife.<br><br> What can we say about LOUIE VEGA..... Grammy Winner, Career Spanning over 35 years and having played the world over more time and to more people than we could ever count..... LOUIE VEGA is a LIVING LEGEND and TRUE to this thing here we call HOUSE and the growth of the music over all!<br><br> A godfather of global dance music, Louie Vega has painted an award-winning career from a palette mixed with everything from salsa and afro-beat, to jazz, hip-hop and soul.<br><br> A godfather of global dance music, Louie Vega has painted an award-winning career from a palette mixed with everything from salsa and afro-beat, to jazz, hip-hop and soul. What distinguishes the Grammy winner and 4-time nominee as one of the best living house music deejays is his ability to evolve alongside the times, distill the current musical landscape through his unique taste and put his own timeless spin on it. \u201cLittle\u201d Louie Vega, as he is sometimes affectionately known, was born in the Bronx into a musically gifted family (his father, a jazz saxophonist, and his uncle, Salsa King H\u00e9ctor Lavoe). The \u201cLittle\u201d moniker is ironic, given the fact that by the 80s he was deejaying at clubs he wasn\u2019t even old enough to attend, holding residencies at Studio 54, Devil\u2019s Nest, Hearthrob, Roseland, and the Palladium. Soon Vega was producing his own remixes, which included Information Society\u2019s \u201cRunning\u201d, Noel\u2019s \u201cSilent Morning\u201d and Debbie Gibson\u2019s \u201cOnly in my Dreams\u201d. Then in 1991 he joined Atlantic Records\u2014and hit the mainstream. Teaming with an-up-and-coming Marc Anthony, he helped to produce \u201cRide on the Rhythm\u201d. An immediate hit, the single put Vega and Anthony on the map. The duo would rock the club circuit, with their success culminating when they opened for Tito Puente at his 100 Album concert at Madison Square Garden.<br> One of the keys to Vega\u2019s success is his knack for refusing to being boxed into any one category, not only reflected in the various music styles his songs play with, but by his fruitful collaborations with other artists. And so more success came in 1991 from the production team he created with Brooklyn-based deejay Kenny \u201cDope\u201d Gonzalez. Masters at Work, as they were called, were responsible for the critically acclaimed albums \u201cNuyorican Soul\u201d and \u201cMasters At Work \u2013 Our Time is Coming\u201d. Not to mention the duo found the time to remix and or produce for Michael Jackson, Luther Vandross, Madonna, Jamiroquai, Tito Puente, India, Janet Jackson, Tania Maria, George Benson, Black Eyed Peas, Jocelyn Brown, Los Amigos Invisibles, Bebe Winans, and Earth Wind & Fire.<br> Vega has always been hungry for a challenge, and the aughts saw him move into new roles that expanded on his artistry; first up, that of record label owner. Featuring a roster that included Anan\u00e9 Vega, Luisito Quintero, Elements Of Life (his live band), Mr. V, Boddhi Satva, Hugh Masekela, Roberto Roena, Lisa Fischer, and Cindy Mizelle, Vega Records has released over 130 singles and 9 Full Length CD / Albums. In addition, Louie Vega has released over 25 compilations (with over 2 million cds sold) on the industry\u2019s most revered imprints, including Ministry of Sound Recordings, Defected Records, Kingstreet, Azuli, Division (Italy), Concept, & Strictly Rhythm records.<br> In his other venture he joined with world-renowned NYC-based jewelry designer Kenny Hwang to create a signature line of hats, jewelry, t-shirts, and additional memorabilia. As these businesses flourished, so did Vega\u2019s music, and in 2006 he received a Grammy Award for his remix of Curtis Mayfield\u2019s \u201cSuperfly\u201d on Rhino Records. Then, not more than a year later, Cirque Du Soleil approached him and the house-music group Blaze to compose and produce a song for a once in a lifetime event. And so Anan\u00e9 Vega and Elements Of life performed the song \u201cOne Dream\u201d to the acrobatics of Cirque Du Soleil during the 2007 Super Bowl Pre-Game Show to over 70,000 people at Dolphin Stadium in Florida and were seen by 145 million television viewers.<br> \u2026Yet as we move through the twenty-tens, Louie shows no signs of slowing down\u2026<br> The past four years since April 2010 have brought forth yet another outlet for Vega. Hosted by Vega and Kevin Hedge, the Roots NYC LIVE Radio Show airs on WBLS 107.5 (New York\u2019s longest running R&B and soul radio station). Rated the #3 radio show in New York on Friday night, they air every Friday from 10PM \u2013 Midnight (stream live www.wbls.com). To keep the music flowing on all the continents, Vega can also be heard every Saturday from 5pm \u2013 6pm over IBIZA SONICA on the Sunset Ritual Radio show with Anane Vega in Spain (www.ibizasonica.com), and every Saturday at 10pm via KAYA FM\u2019s Dance Ritual with Louie Vega (www.kayafm.co.za) in Johannesburg, South Africa. Ever the music innovator, in 2013 Vega released Elements of Life \u2013 Eclipse on the legendary Fania records. The record, 4 \u00bd years in the making, keeps the style of Vega\u2019s earlier albums (African, Jazz, Latin, World), but injects it with Soul, R&B, Gospel and Blues. Featured artists on the album include Anan\u00e9 Vega, Lisa Fischer, Cindy Mizelle, Ursula Rucker, Josh Milan, Luisito Quintero, Oveus Maximus and an all-star cast of musicians. The occasion was momentous not only because it was the first new artist album Fania had released in years. In Vega\u2019s words, \u201c\u2026[It] really comes full circle now, being able to be on the label my uncle H\u00e9ctor Lavoe was on and the Fania All Stars who are all great inspirations for me. Fania Records is to Latin music what Motown is to R&B and Soul, so to even be a small page in this encyclopedia of music is a dream come true for me.\u201d<br> With all the good fortune he\u2019s received, Vega finds it crucial to give back. During most of his free time he donates Vega Memorabilia to auctions, deejays at fundraisers and serves as a good will ambassador for the Christian Rivera Foundation. Currently, Vega and Anan\u00e9 are headlining their Sunset Ritual brand, an outdoor party held at prestigious beach clubs around the world and drenched in the sounds of House, Global Disco, Afro tech and Old School. Sunset Ritual has toured the Mediterranean every summer since 2010, including a two-year residency at the Blue Marlin beach club in Ibiza. Just this past year, from the 21st of June until the 20th of September 2013, the Sunset Ritual\u2019s good vibes were back in Ibiza, this time at the famed Ushua\u00efa Hotel. This May 2014, Anan\u00e9 and Louie will release the first Sunset Ritual cd/dvd. Then in the summer Sunset Ritual will resume across beaches of Ibiza, Formentera, Italy, and Greece. In 2014, Masters At Work will reunite with a full blown project and Anthology on the House Masters Defected Release #21. Louie Vega & Kenny Dope will once again come together to create music and do what they do best, produce and make you dance!Breaking down musical barriers and bringing people together through a love of music has always been Vega\u2019s aim; after more than 20 years in the game his contributions continue to positively influence the global house and world music.<br> Listen closely as the best has yet to come from Louie Vega!</p></p>", "title": "Output Fifth Anniversary - Louie Vega & Friends", "url": "http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/output-fifth-anniversary-louie-vega-friends-/E0-001-109633054-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Output", "date": "2018-01-28 22:00:00"}, {"city": "Birmingham", "description": " Join us in the West Midlands in January where the city of Birmingham will play host to the some of the worlds top designers as part of the RIBA BIM EXPO & aae BIM camp at BIM in Birmingham 2018.

I feel cleansed. What an awesome experience!\u201d \u2013Eric Tong \u201cI chose to go to Wisdom Wednesday to find a sanctuary in which to heal, energize, and share space with a like-minded community. Unsure of what I would find or what to expect, I found that and much more. Upon walking through Jummee\u2019s doors I was greeted by beautiful people and open arms. I was showered throughout the night with high vibrations, magical sounds, delicious cacao, and healing energy. \u2026 We shared, moved, meditated, sound-healed, jammed, connected. I would most definitely recommend checking out one of Jummee\u2019s workshops and experiencing the magic for yourself.\u201d \u2013 Vanessa Coletto \u201cAs someone who considers himself to be generally grounded and spiritual, my recent move across the country and the adjustments that came with it has gradually thrown my mental balance off and I found myself growing more and more impatient and frustrated with the demanding new outside world in which I found myself. My inner machine was operating, but I was losing touch of the processes happening under the surface and rarely took a moment to check in on what\u2019s going on inside. Word of mouth brought me to Jummee\u2019s group practice, and immediately I knew I found a special group of people seeking the same things that I was. We spent the evening going through a variety of exercises \u2013 breathing, moving, sitting, laying down, making weird faces, stretching, focusing \u2013 all following Jummee\u2019s wise and quirky guidance. It was fun, it was tough, it was funny and it was profound. For the first time in a long time, I felt like I was truly bonding with myself and others around me. \u2026 The evening ended with a relaxing sound bath and we all went outside to drink cacao and chat by the bonfire. The next day I already noticed a change in my attitude towards myself and the world around me. Jummee\u2019s method really challenges you to go inside and explore the relationship between your physical and emotional bodies. I took the exercises and new perspective from that night and carried it with me in the next days and weeks. It was amazing what this practice did for me in such little time, and I\u2019ve gone back three more times since. Each time peeling one more layer of discomfort and learning to be more loving, relaxed open and authentic. I\u2019d recommend Jummee\u2019s practice to anyone who wants to get to know themselves on a deeper level, challenge themselves to open up and be expressive and have lots of fun with the process itself! I am so grateful to have become a part of this community.\u201d \u2013 Ofer Zmora \u201cJummee Method&#39;s Wisdom Wednesday has become a crucial element in my journey to find balance and a higher degree of love, self love, and peace in my day-to-day life. Jummee and her team provide beautiful space and a guided meditation, which is incredibly heart opening and encourages profound reflection. When I first started working with Jummee, I had just moved across the country and was experiencing waves of doubt and self-criticism, building walls of protection that only hindered my growth and separated me from the people I was meeting. After undergoing so much change, I was quick to try to control things in my life, rather than going with the flow and accepting things as they are. I felt boxed in and I needed to let go of whatever was holding me back from feeling free. The Jummee Method has been truly powerful. It combines variations of meditation, sound healing and breath work in a candle-lit space with hints of relaxing aromatherapy. Every week I feel more relaxed, in tune with myself, confident with myself, happy, and most importantly OPEN. Open to give and receive love; open to change: open to accept what comes my way. I can\u2019t express enough how grateful I am for Full Spectrum Retreat. For the heart opening and all the silliness. Highly recommend this to anyone and everyone who is holding onto something, anything, a little too tight.\u201d \u2013 Sarah Balter \u201c\u2026a transcending experience\u2026great community\u2026amazing\u2026\u201d \u2013 Jenna DeNight \u201cBefore I felt tense and guarded, after I felt relaxed. I think this is an experience one must be open to\u2026you need an intention.\u201d \u2013 Anthony Biz \u201c\u2026the sound bath, the combination of the breathing exercises, sounds, and positioning transitioned perfectly to transport me. Before I was in pain physically and blocked mentally, after I felt easy, centered, cleared, and balanced.

But for everyone.&quot;\u00a0 Joe Hurley recently told the HUFFINGTON POST\u00a0 &quot; People of all ethnicities can see themselves in the melodies, the lyrics, of the Irish. By embracing the Irish Songbook, were all pretty much holding hands across the water. Sharing the human condition. It&#39;s a joyful event, cracking songs from Thin Lizzy, Van, to old ballads my mother sang for me as a child. Anyone coming to the Revue for the first time will hear wonderful Irish songs that they know, along with obscure ones. And they&#39;re not going to hear this anywhere else thanks to the cross-cultural mix of all the artists. A Syrian folk singer, Tristame, doing &#39;Dirty Old Town?\u2019 Perfect. The artists are not all of Irish descent & that&#39;s the point. Ethnically across the board, as culturally diverse as it gets.

The group blends bluegrass, old time, country, folk, blues, jazz, and ragtime music. The group's members are guitarist Pete Bernhard, upright bassist Lucia Turino, and guitarist and tenor banjo player Cooper McBean.\n\n\u201cThe rhythm is what our band is about.\" Says Pete Bernhard: Guitarist, Front Man. The Devil Makes Three are quite possibly the best band that you have never heard of. They have been constantly on tour, selling out dates across the country and in their neck of the woods on the West Coast drawing near capacity crowds nightly. This is all word of mouth. Over the years, the Devil Makes Three have garnered fans the old school way, playing a city, making friends, conquering fans and moving on.\n\nLaced with elements of ragtime, blues, country, folk and rockabilly, the critically praised, drummer-less trio - consisting of Vermont native, guitarist/front man Pete Bernhard, stand-up bassist Lucia Turino and guitarist Cooper McBean, also of rural Vermont - brings forth a genuine approach to acoustic music.

A cover of Animal Collective&#39;s &quot;Bees,&quot; which can still be viewed on YouTube was the final song in an entire evening of Animal Collective songs Seasons had put together with some friends at the Echo (in LA) on Oct. 29, 2012. As Moody wails and Seasons gently harmonizes behind her over twinkling synths and processed guitar, you can sense the audience holding their breath as the band was born.

With their previous EP, Something in the Water, the group crafted a captivating, ethereal musical journey through a nostalgic world of young love and long-forgotten memories.

Having completed multiple headlining tours across the country and a new 45 day tour to start 2018 off, Haunted Summer is poised to bring their psychedelic sound to the world.Haunted Summer crafts languid pop music, adorned with orchestral strings and electronic textures that recall Soft Bulletin-era Flaming Lips.-Candice Aman (KXSC Radio) The five tracks on the Something in The Water reinforce the group&#39;s ghostly vibes, with Moody&#39;s ethereal vocals blending seamlessly with spaced-out and hazy orchestral dream-pop, allowing the music to take control of your headspace like a ray of light seeping in through the cracks of a long forgotten and rundown gothic mansion. -The Portland Mercury (CT)The pairs blend of experimental guitar riffs, ethereal orchestral features, and Moodys trance-like vocalsplus a ton of oddball electronic sounds that add even more texturecreates a sound that sticks with you. -The Seattle Weekly (Azaria Podplesky)Bridgette Eliza Moody and John Seasons are the groups mainstays, but they have smartly added other musicians to the mix, taking their music to a bolder, higher level. The use of clarinet especially enhances and grounds their sound as Moody&#39;s augmented vocals and Seasons languid guitar licks add ethereal layers. -The Inlander (Laura Johnson) Haunted Summer features Bridgette Moody and John Seasons, who share songwriting and performing duties in a true collaboration. The result is a very pretty, psychedelic sound with ethereal vocals from Bridgette, who comes into her own as a lead vocalist. -Julia Stoller(The Boston Music Survival Guide)The music definitely fulfills the definition of dream pop. The lyrical content relies heavily on longing for and reveling in young love.This is a young band with a high ceiling, I would not be surprised if these songs break out nationally. The title track ends with &quot;No one will love you when you are loved&quot; however this band has love to spare, and I except big things coming their way. -Scott Schultz (LA Record)Its like falling asleep in a bathtub of cough syrup. - Wayne Jessup(The Owl Mag)&quot;Just two days after the release of their eerily-named EP, Something In The Water, dream pop duo, Haunted Summer, will make the room echo and whirl to the tune of their supernatural anthems, already quite a hit amongst fellow Angelenos&quot; -Cynthia Orgel (Santa Cruz&#39;s GoodTimes Weekly)Together, the Highland Park coed duo makes digi-folk pop thats as enticing as it is spooky. Like an echo in a cave, Moodys voice carries an eerie yet seductive vibe over soothing strums or gentle beats. This is the sound of dew forming on a chilly morning-DanFrazier (Free Bike Valet blog)Over the first couple months as Haunted Summer, Seasons and Moody wrote a flurry of songs, recording at home and then enlisting friends to play the music live, first around LA and then on tour in support of Polyphonic Spree, Islands and Taken By Trees. - Eric Swedlund (TucsonWeekly)Haunted Summer, lives up to its name with an even more enchanting series of dream-pop shimmers, as Bridgette Eliza Moody&#39;s vocals trail off languidly in the jet stream of husband John Seasons&#39; majestic emissions. -Falling James (LA Weekly)Their brand of dream pop feels timeless, with just the right amount of youthful nostalgia to woo your ears into submission. Moodys smooth, light as air vocals captivate like a siren of the sea, while the arrangements are lush and seductive, but never pushy. Its a delightful combination that has the power to fill any lazy summer day with an extra bit of magic. -Jacqueline Caruso (The Deli Magazine LA)Theres no question that whatever is haunting Moody and Seasons is steering the duo toward a beautiful place. -Kevin Bronson (Buzzbands LA)Windswept vocals, sultry strings and spacey guitar blend together beautifully. The whole thing is mysterious and engrossing enough that it gets under your skin and stirs your own private nostalgia. -Billy Gil (Amoeba Blog)Haunted Summer features Bridgette Moody and John Seasons, who share songwriting and performing duties in a true collaboration. The result is a very pretty, psychedelic sound with ethereal vocals from Bridgette, who comes into her own as a lead vocalist. -Julia Stoller (The Boston Music Survival Guide)Haunted Summer is a band whose music eerily fits their name perfectly. Angelic, other-worldly vocals lead the way and give life to a beautiful dream-pop inspired sound. -Glen Casebeer (Northwest Music Scene)Haunted Summer is John Seasons & Bridgette Moody. Together they are heading in directions they couldnt pursue in their former bands, making eerie psychedelic orchestral pop.-Kathryn Pinto (Radio Free Silver Lake)Haunted Summer&#39;s &quot;Something in the Water&quot;, is full of hazy chamber-psych that unfolds in slo-mo, providing plenty of room for Bridgette&#39;s nostalgic croon. It&#39;s a likeable sound, as evidenced by the inordinate number of press clippings the band has posted to its Tumblr. -The Portland Mercury (Ben Salmon)The sexy, head trip music of Bridgette Moody and John Seasons seems to take shape somewhere in the space between your ears. They feed you all their hypnotic sounds and leave your brain and senses to figure it out. -Brad Roberts (Feed Your Head Blog)Their brand of synth-y mid-tempo dream pop along with Moodys ethereal vocals weave through whimsical melodies with twinkly resonance. -Melody Stone (Capital Public Radio)On Something in the Water, gentle, hazy vocals take the forefront, gliding along on clouds of delicate synth and simple, nostalgic melodies. Just when the whole thing is about to float off untethered into the ether, though, come gentle rolls of surf guitar and sudden sweeps of strings that keep things grounded in a wall of intricately-woven electronic sounds. Despite its gentle ease, theres still something kind of eery about the way the harmonies seem to linger in the air for a moment, even after a song ends. - Kaitie Todd (Willamette Weekly)Haunted Summer consists of Bridgette Eliza Moody and John Seasons, reigning from the Los Angeles area. The group crafts ethereal, dream pop that comes off haunting live -Shane Jackson (DTLV MUSIC)Haunted Summer play mostly mid-tempo, textual music that is heavy on the guitar effects and synthesized sounds. Moodys voice is a powerful, emotive tool that plays soft, sweet contrast to the hints of darkness below. It makes for an eerie, soft-at-the-edges psychedelia. - Joshua Tehee (The Fresno Bee)", "title": "Haunted Summer", "url": "http://eventful.com/flagstaff/events/haunted-summer-/E0-001-110505938-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "The Green Room", "date": "2018-01-22 20:00:00"}], "description": "There are two artists with the name Meiko:\n1) an American singer/songwriter\n2) the first Japanese-language Vocaloid\n\n1) Meiko (pronounced MEE-ko) (born February 25, 1982), is an American singer/ songwriter, born and raised in Roberta, Georgia and currently residing in Los Angeles, California. She independently released a self-titled album on September 1, 2007. All of the tracks from the LP have been featured in major network TV shows. Her second full-length album, entitled The Bright Side, was released through Fantasy Records on May 15, 2012.\n\nRaised by her father in the small town of Roberta, Georgia, Meiko first stepped in front of an audience at the age of eight, singing \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d for parishioners of a Southern Baptist church. At eighteen, Meiko left her hometown to showcase her talents to a wider audience. After a brief stop in Miami, she set down in Los Angeles and began her career in earnest, playing venues all over Southern California and writing at a prolific pace. She performed (and bartended) at Hollywood's Hotel Caf\u00e9 (where she still performs regularly).\n\nMeiko is one-quarter Japanese, on her maternal grandmother's side; in an attempt to get in touch with their Japanese heritage, she and her sister, designer Kelly Nishimoto, adopted the nicknames Meiko and Keiko.\n\n2) The name of the first Japanese-language Vocaloid released by Crypton Future Media, released in 2004. Vocaloid is a singing synthesizer application software developed by the Yamaha Corporation that enables users to synthesize singing by just typing in lyrics and melody. Numbered Crypton Vocaloid 00, Meiko was the first female Vocaloid, counterpart to Kaito.  Her voice is based on a Japanese female singer Haig\u014d Meiko (\u62dd\u90f7 \u30e1\u30a4\u30b3). Her voice is noted to be steady, straightforward, and suitable for any musical genre. She is fit to sing anything from pop, rock, jazz, R&B to children's songs. Since Vocaloid has some functions that Vocaloid 2 do not have, such as Resonance. Different users can utilize the voicebanks offered very differently and she can produce a wide range of different results from the same few voicebanks.\n\nOn July 24, 2003, an CCCD album \"HISTORY OF LOGIC SYSTEM\", which included a song using Japanese vocaloids commercially for the first time, was released. It was a duet song of \"Ano Subarashii Ai wo Mou Ichido (That Wonderful Love Once More)\" and it was covered by prototype version of Meiko and Kaito before their release.

The four piece released EPs and singles before signing up with German record label Nuclear Blast and releasing a successful self-titled debut album Blues Pills. The band released their second album Lady in Gold in August 2016.\n\nHistory: Formation and EPs\nIn 2011, half-brothers Zack Anderson (bass) and Cory Berry (drums), formerly of Radio Moscow, were in Iowa and met singer Elin Larsson, who was staying in California. Together they recorded two demo tracks and published them on YouTube, after which label \"Crusher Records\" offered them a deal. The band toured to Spain and France, where they met 16-year-old guitarist Dorian Sorriaux, whom they invited to \u00d6rebro and made a member of the band. The name of the band came from their friend, Jens Heide, who had a music blog called BluesPillz with obscure 60s and 70s underground music.\n\nIn May 2012 they released an EP called \"Bliss\", followed by the \"Black Smoke\" single in July. The band toured extensively during 2013 with appearances in Berlin's \"Desertfest\" in April, in Bad K\u00f6tzting's \"Void Fest\" and Geel's \"Yellowstock Festival\" in August, in Bonn's \"Crossroads Festival\" in October and Melbourne's \"Cherry Rock Festival\" in November 2013.\n\nIn July 2013, Blues Pills signed a contract with the \"Nuclear Blast\" label and released their \"Devil Man\" EP in October. Their appearance at the \"Crossroads Festival\" was recorded and released in the form of the \"Live at Rockpalast\" EP in March 2014.\n\nThe debut album\nIn July 2014 they released their first album, Blues Pills, the special edition of which included a DVD of their appearance in the \"Hammer of Doom\" festival from the year before. Shortly after the release of the first album, Cory Berry was replaced with new drummer Andr\u00e9 Kvarnstr\u00f6m.\n\nIn the summer of 2014 they appeared in the \"Sweden Rock Festival\", in Gelsenkirchen's \"Rock Hard Festival\" in June and in the famous Montreux Jazz Festival in July 2014.\n\nThe album became successful in Europe, climbing to No. 4 in Germany and No. 10 in Switzerland, while it also reached British charts at No. 68.\n\n2016\u2013present: Lady in Gold\nDuring the end of 2015 and the start of 2016, the band started writing and recorded for their second album. On 22 April, 2016, Blues Pills announced that Lady in Gold will be released on August 5, 2016 through Nuclear Blast Records with a ten track set-list.\n\nIn 2016, Blues Pills will tour with Kadavar, play festivals in the summer in North America and Europe followed by a UK tour in November.\n\nStudio albums\nBlues Pills (2014)\nLady in Gold (2016) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Blues+Pills\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It debuted at Number One on the UK Singles Chart on 23 October. The release of the song and its rise to number one further increased the ever-growing hype surrounding the band, and it was two weeks before they reached the cover of NME magazine.

Despite a midweek release, the song entered the UK singles chart at number 11, making it the band's highest charting single since \"Fluorescent Adolescent\" in 2007.\n\nIn terms of both lyrical content and aesthetic style, \"Do I Wanna Know?\" picks up from where the band's 2012 single \"R U Mine?\" left off. The guitar riffs are strikingly similar, but the song is more downtempo. The track continues the hard-edged, rocking sound of their previous album Suck It and See.

The single was released in physical formats on 16 April, the week before the release of the album, and charted at #2 in the UK Singles Chart behind Beyonc\u00e9' and Shakira's \"Beautiful Liar.\" It is the band's fourth single in the United Kingdom, following number ones \"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\", and \"When the Sun Goes Down\", as well as the non-album track \"Leave Before the Lights Come On\".

It was first played on Zane Lowe's show on BBC Radio 1 on 6 July 2009, when talking about the song frontman Alex Turner told Lowe, \"this was deemed the best signifier of the record. It was a favourite during recording.\" When Lowe commented that he thought this track works well as an unconventional pop song, Turner agreed saying, \"It's quite strange as far as a pop song goes, the arrangement.\"  The track was then made available on iTunes to download the following day. Physical copies of the single were made available on 17 August, one week before the release of the album. The vinyl was made available in Oxfam shops and sold with a download code for fans to get a free MP3 version of the song. The single debuted at #12 on the UK Singles Chart on 12 July 2009 by downloads alone.\n\nThe music video for the single debuted on Channel 4 in UK on 24 July 2009. It was directed by Richard Ayoade, who worked with the band previously on the video for Fluorescent Adolescent, as well as their \"At the Apollo\" live DVD. The video features the band performing the song on a boat on a rough sea. During a short instrumental interlude, a large figure rises up from the sea in the form of frontman, Turner. He falls to his knees where the boat passes between his legs before the other three band members also rise up out from the water.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Arctic+Monkeys/_/Crying+Lightning\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band consists of Alex Turner (vocals, guitar), Jamie Cook (guitar), Nick O'Malley (backing vocals, bass) and Matt Helders (drums, vocals). Founding bassist Andy Nicholson left in 2006.\n\nThe band has released five studio albums, \"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not\" (2006), \"Favourite Worst Nightmare\" (2007), \"Humbug\" (2009), \"Suck It and See\" (2011) and \"AM\" (2013), all of which debuted at #1 on the UK Albums Chart. \n\nEach of the band's first five singles I Bet You Look Good On the Dancefloor, When the Sun Goes Down, Leave Before The Lights Come On, Brianstorm and Fluorescent Adolescent hit the UK Top Five, but their sixth single, Teddy Picker, only went Top 20 and their seventh single, Crying Lightning peaked at #12.\n\nThe band's rise to success started in late 2004/early 2005 when demo songs which had been handed out in CD form at gigs found their way onto the internet. These demos rapidly spread among message boards and friends leading to a growing fan base for the band, and were collected on the unofficial Beneath the Boardwalk, which the band recognizes on their website.  The band owe much of their success to viral buzz via the Internet, and have eschewed typical 'commercial' channels, including refusing to appear on the UK's (now discontinued) Top Of The Pops music program, which was often seen as a gateway to success.\n\nThe band's debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, held the record for the largest first week sales of a debut album in the UK (in its first week, it sold more than the rest of the Top 20 albums combined). The album sold over 360,000 copies in its first week, but lost the title in November 2007 to Leona Lewis's album Spirit.\n\nOn 19th June 2006 the band officially announced that founding member Andy Nicholson had left the band after missing the American leg of their tour due to 'fatigue' and the other band members couldn't stand the constant 'missing his girlfriend syndrome' so told him to sling his hook. Former Dodgems bassist,  Nick O'Malley was initially brought in as a stand-in, and played the band's remaining summer commitments. He was then announced as Nicholson's permanent replacement. \n\nThe single Leave Before The Lights Come On came out on August 14th, but only reached Number 4 on the UK charts, denying the band a third consecutive number 1 single.\n\nTheir debut album \"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not\" won the 2006 Mercury Prize, was chosen as the best album of year 2006 by Q Magazine, and received a slew of other accolades.\n\nTheir second album Favourite Worst Nightmare was released on April 23rd 2007. It was preceded by \"Brianstorm\", the first single from the album, which was released a week before. Like its predecessor, \"Favourite Worst Nightmare\" sold more than the rest of the Top 20 combined, and - due to an error on iTunes - every song on the record appeared on the UK Top 200 Singles the next week.\n\nWhen asked about Favourite Worst Nightmare Alex Turner commented, \"We haven't changed that much. It's still about making contact with girls or not making contact with girls\".\n\nThe band began to write and record demos for the third album in January 2008, Turner said \"We had tunes that we'd already been playing on tour so we recorded them. That\u2019s six [songs]. We\u2019re going to take it easy and start practicing over the summer and doing new stuff.\"\n\nThe band premiered new material from the unreleased album during their January 2009 tour of New Zealand, playing small venues in Wellington and Auckland ahead of the Big Day Out festival. Their first show in more than a year was on January 13, 2009 at Wellington's Town Hall. In both cities, the new songs played were \"Crying Lightning\", \"Go-Kart\", \"Dangerous Animals\" and \"Pretty Visitors.\" The full set list from the Auckland gig is available online. Also played was a cover of the Nick Cave song \"Red Right Hand.\" During their last tour, the band had played new songs \"Put Me In A Terror Pocket\", \"Sandtrap,\" and \"The Fire and The Thud\" live.\n\nLead singer/songwriter Alex Turner started a two-man project with the singer from the Rascals, Miles Kane.\nThe band is called 'The Last Shadow Puppets'\n\nThe band released their new album Humbug in August of 2009, preceded by the single \" Crying Lightning\"\n\nThey released their fourth studio album, entitled Suck It And See on June 6th 2011\n\nhttp://www.arcticmonkeys.com/\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Arctic+Monkeys\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released as album's third single. One of Linkin Park's most well known and popular tracks, \"Numb\" topped the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart for 12 weeks. The song spent six weeks at the top of the chart in 2003 and six weeks in 2004, making it the only song in history to be the most successful song of the year on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart for two years. The song also spent three weeks atop the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and peaked at #11 on the Billboard Hot 100. It has been criticized for sounding similar to a song called \"Pushing Me Away\", which was in their Hybrid Theory album.\n\nThe song was later combined with Jay-Zs song \"Encore\" to create \"Numb/Encore\", a massive hit for both artists which was featured on the album Collision Course. A techno remix of \"Numb\" has received over 3 million views on YouTube. \"Numb\" was ranked #92 on Rhapsody's list of the Top 100 Tracks of the Decade.\n\n\nMusic Video\nDirected by Joe Hahn, the indoor scenes of the music video are set in a church in Los Angeles, while the outdoor scenes are set in Prague, in Czech Republic. The school interiors, the classroom, the corridor and the outside playground are set in the Johannes Kepler's High School in Prague.\n\nThe video follows the domestic and social problems faced during a day in the life of an unpopular young female student (portrayed by Briana Evigan). The girl apparently spends much of her time drawing pictures, revealing that she probably has dreams of becoming an artist. She is largely ignored and ridiculed at school, considering that when she is told off by the teacher for drawing in class everybody laughs at her, when she trips on the stairs nobody stops to help her up, and that when she tries to join a group of girls at a lunch table they immediately get up and leave. Also, there is a scene where her mother is ridiculing her for not being the daughter she wanted. There are also self-inflicted cut marks on her arms, which actually say \"NUMB\" - the title of the song. She is shown near the end of the video rubbing the marks after a stressful day, and then deciding to work off her stress by throwing paint instead. At the end of the video, the girl runs into the church that the band was playing in, almost as if she heard them.\n\nThroughout almost the whole video Chester Bennington has his eyes closed, they can just be seen open when he blinks as he sings the word: \"Tightly\" from the second verse starting: \"Can't you see that you're smothering me?\"\n\nMuchMusic's 100 Best Videos ranked it at #40.\n\nThe track became one of Linkin Park's most critically-acclaimed songs, as well as one of their most commercially successful, peaking at #11 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 on February 24, 2004, and spending 3 weeks on top of the Mainstream Rock Tracks and 12 weeks on top of the Modern Rock Tracks. \"Numb\" was the 33rd best performing single on the Hot 100 during 2004. It was also successful in Oceania, peaking at #10 in Australia and #13 in New Zealand. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Linkin+Park/_/Numb\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is also the song that catapulted the band to stardom, especially towards the rock audience, as well as one of the band's well-known songs. The song reached #79 on the Hot 100 on February 20, 2001.\n\nAccording to the One Step Closer Songfacts, the vocals were recorded in Mike Shinoda's flat one night while an angry neighbor hammered on the wall. He couldn't hear the actual music, just Chester Bennington screaming into the microphone.\n\nUntil 2007, Linkin Park has closed every concert to date with \"One Step Closer\", excluding Live 8, their live performance at Summer Sonic.\n\nDuring the 2001 MTV VMA performance of the song, the band had The X-Ecutioners do an extended break before the bridge. This part was somewhat similar to the atmosphere on the remix, with synth parts and faint vocal parts being scratched.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2007, performances of the song include a verse originally sung by Jonathan Davis in the Reanimation remix of the song before the \"Shut up when I'm talking to you!\" bridge. At the end of the verse, Bennington then repeats the line \"Blood is pouring\" while the song builds up to the bridge.\nOn occasion, Shinoda sings \"Blood is pouring\" under Bennington's screaming during this part, as is done by Jonathan Davis on the remix. This is half-done on the performance at 2004's Rock am Ring (in that Shinoda only sings the part during the second half of the bridge) and fully done during a performance during 2003's Projekt Revolution tour, which was recorded and included on the \"Faint\" single and is available as a bonus track for Reanimation when purchased on iTunes. On the single cover, it is called '\"One Step Closer\" (Reanimated Live)'. During the 2006 live performances in Japan, the Reanimation bridge was played with the main riff of the song.\n\nDuring the band's 2007 tour, \"One Step Closer\" became the opening song of Linkin Park's performances, and the Reanimation verse was removed. It also featured a new, extended intro featuring Mike Shinoda on rhythm guitar.\n\nIn 2008 it became a new extended outro, and sometimes it was performed as the last song. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Linkin+Park/_/One+Step+Closer\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released as the sixth and final single from the album in 2004. It became the fifth consecutive single from Meteora to reach #1 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, a feat unmatched by any other artist in the history of that chart. It was also the second single from the album to reach #1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. It was a pop hit, peaking at #20 on the Billboard Hot 100 on September 7, 2004.\nBreaking the Habit features many electronics, live strings and guitar. There are no distorted guitar riffs, and it is the first single released by Linkin Park to include no vocals from Mike Shinoda.\nA common misconception about this song is that it was written by lead singer Chester Bennington, when in fact, band member Mike Shinoda was the original writer. The song was based on a close friend's drug addiction.[citation needed] It is a common idea that it was written about Bennington due to his extended drug abuse issues, although Shinoda began writing the song before he met Bennington.[citation needed] The rumour has its roots in Bennington's reluctance to play the song at early live shows, because he was able to relate to it so closely.\nIn an issue of Kerrang, Mike Shinoda mentioned that the song was originally going to be an instrumental track over ten minutes long, but was convinced by the band to change it.[1]\n\nNotable cover: What I see is what I sing about (a parody to Linkin Park's Breaking The Habit) <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Linkin+Park/_/Breaking+the+Habit\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song reached the top thirty on the Hot 100 Airplay, and the following week it debuted on the Hot 100, the official U.S. chart. \"Somewhere I Belong\" peaked at number thirty-two in its fifteenth week and remained on the chart until its twentieth week. The song entered the top ten on the majority of the Billboard charts on which it appeared. While \"Somewhere I Belong\" proved somewhat popular on modern rock radio, it reached number one on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.\n\nIn Canada \"Somewhere I Belong\" was officially released to radio in March 2003. The song reached the top five on the Canadian Singles Chart where it peaked at #3. \"Somewhere I Belong\" is the highest charted Linkin Park song in Canada.\n\nThe song was released in Australia, Europe and New Zealand in May 2003. \"Somewhere I Belong\" peaked at number ten in the UK Singles Chart. Although Linkin Park reached number one in New Zealand and the top ten in the Ireland, Japan and Canada, it was a moderate top twenty success in Germany, Italy, Austria, Netherland, Sweden and Australia. \"Somewhere I Belong\" reached the top thirty in France and Belgia in early 2003. The song was also featured in a profile video for Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nConservative commentator Mark Levin's son selected the song's instrumental as the bumper music for his father's radio talk show.\n\nIts clip, directed by Joseph Hahn, shows the band playing the song in front of a fire, with occasional shots of Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda in front of a waterfall with what look like Asian monks around them. The doors in what is supposedly Bennington's room has the Chinese characters for fire and water, which possibly represent the waterfall and burning fire behind Shinoda while rapping. During the video, on a dresser sits several props, most notably figures of Sazabi from Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack, Wing Zero Custom from Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz, and Gundam GP01 Full Vernian \"Zephyranthes\" from Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory.

The song was released as the second single from their third studio album, Minutes to Midnight, on August 17, 2007.\n\nOn July 30, 2007 the music video was shown on MTV Germany and MTV Asia and has premiered in Canada through the Muchmusic Countdown and their MuchAxs video streaming website. This song was #44 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007. This song was also #83 on MTV Asia's list of Top 100 Hits of 2007.\n\nThe song is featured in the main setlist for the rhythm video game Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock.\n\nThe song is written by Linkin Park and produced by Mike Shinoda and Rick Rubin\n\n\"Bleed It Out\" is the first of two tracks on the album to contain rap vocals from Mike Shinoda, with the other being \"Hands Held High\". It is also the second track of the 3 songs in the album to contain profanity (aside from \"Given Up\" and \"Hands Held High\"). The structure of \"Bleed It Out\" is similar to that of the band's earlier hit, \"Faint\", in which both are fairly short songs, have rapped verses and a sung chorus and bridge, and are both about frustration.\n\nThe main guitar riff of \"Bleed It Out\" which repeats throughout a majority of the song came as a result of guitarist Brad Delson playing a note incorrectly, thus explaining the song's working title of \"Accident\".\n\nIn the album booklet, it says that the song was largely a product of the band simply \"Enjoying the process\" of making the album. Furthermore, Mike Shinoda stated that the lyrics to this track were difficult to perfect, as he re-wrote the lyrics to this song about a \"hundred times\" (referenced to in the first line of the song: \"Here we go for the hundredth time\") until the band was satisfied with them.\n\nThe song is the shortest track on Minutes to Midnight, besides the instrumental intro, \"Wake\". However, in live performances the song's bridge is often extended to include a drum solo by Rob Bourdon. In Road to Revolution, the song also includes a \"singing contest\" led by Chester and Mike which is omitted in the CD version.\n\nIn the A Thousand Suns World Tour, the drum solo was removed and pieces of \"Burning in the Skies\" and \"A Place for My Head\" were added to the song. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Linkin+Park/_/Bleed+It+Out\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released on February 17, 2008 in United Kingdom as a digital download. The song was not as much as a success upon what was expected in the U.S, although it did manage to chart high on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks and the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks.\n\n\"Given Up\", along with the hit singles \"What I've Done\" and \"Bleed It Out\", made its live debut on April 28, 2007 in Berlin, Germany. Live performances of these three songs at the AOL sessions were released on AOL on May 5, 2007. The performance of the song is available on the \"Bleed It Out\" CD single.\n\n\"Given Up\" is one of the heavier songs on the album. It notably features a eighteen second-long scream by Chester Bennington before the final chorus, as well as a steady guitar riff for the choruses of the song. The scream is split into two 9 second long screams when performed live allowing Chester to catch his breath, although he has completed the full scream in various live performances. It dawns a distinctive jingle sound during the verses and intro, generated by the jingling of guitarist Brad Delson's keys and a steady clapping beat by Mike Shinoda. The song was made available as a single on March 3, 2008. It is included as a master track in the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Nintendo Wii versions of the music video game Rock Revolution. The song was also used in the trailer and commercials for the action film Crank 2: High Voltage, in which Bennington makes a cameo.\n\nIn June 2007, the official Billboard website gave information stating that \"Given Up\" and \"Shadow of the Day\" would be the next two singles from Minutes to Midnight, following \"What I've Done\". This proved incorrect after \"Bleed It Out\" was promoted to single status. On January 24, 2008, it was announced that \"Given Up\" would be the band's next single after \"Shadow of the Day\", released on October 16, 2007. The single was released as digital download on February 17, 2008 along with a cover art.\n\nOn Chester Bennington's official blog, he stated when the video was being shot and that it features live performance from the band. Bennington told the crowd at the MEN Arena and the O2 Arena during shows on January 27 and 29 that the performance of \"Given Up\" was recorded for use in the video although cameras were also visible during the performance of the song at the concert on January 28 at the O2 Arena. Linkin Park had officially finished filming the video on February 6, according to Billboard. The video premiered on the band's official website on March 3, 2008 at 4p.m. Pacific Standard Time (Midnight UTC). The video was uploaded to the band's YouTube  channel on March 4, 2008. The video was directed by Mark Fiore, the band's videographer.\n\nThe video consists of live clips from the shows (stated above) and has been edited together in a sharp, rugged manner which contains short cut scenes with many special effects mainly altering the coloring. Transitions between cut scenes are in a style of warn analog tape distortion giving the video an even more rugged, tough appearance. Bennington performs his seventeen-second scream perched on the guard rail, inches from the audience. Throughout the video several flash scenes appear such as a cowboy, hippopotamus and quotes from \"Magical Thinking: True Stories\" (chapter \"Commercial Break\") a book by the Augusten Burroughs.

Formed in 1996 the band rose to international fame with their debut album, Hybrid Theory, which was certified Diamond by the RIAA in 2005 and multi-platinum in several other countries. Its following studio album, Meteora, continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work around the world. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth greatest band of the music video era and the third best of the new millennium behind Oasis and Coldplay.\n\nHaving adapted the nu metal and rap metal genres to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in Hybrid Theory and Meteora, the band explored other genres in their next studio album, Minutes to Midnight, which was released in 2007. The album topped the Billboard charts and had the third best debut week of any album that year. The band has collaborated with several other artists, most notably with rapper Jay-Z in their mashup EP Collision Course, and many others included on Reanimation. The band's most recent studio album, A Thousand Suns, was released on September 8, 2010. Linkin Park has sold over 50 million albums worldwide and has won two Grammy Awards. \n\nCharity:\nOn January 19, 2010, Linkin Park released a new song titled Not Alone as part of a compilation from Music for Relief called Download to Donate for Haiti in support of the Haiti Earthquake crisis. On February 10, 2010, Linkin Park released the official music video for the song on their homepage. The single itself was released on October 21, 2011.\n\nOn January 11, 2011, an updated version of Download to Donate for Haiti was launched, called Download to Donate for Haiti V2.0, with more songs to download. For the updated compilation, the band released Keaton Hashimoto's remix of The Catalyst from the \"Linkin Park featuring YOU\" contest.\n\nShinoda designed two t-shirts, in which the proceeds will go to Music for Relief to help the victims of the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami disasters. Music For Relief released Download to Donate: Tsunami Relief Japan, another compilation of songs, in which the proceeds will go to Save the Children. The band released the song titled as Issho Ni, meaning \"we're in this together\", on March 22, 2011 via Download to Donate: Tsunami Relief Japan.\n\nIn the wake of Typhoon Haiyan, Linkin Park played at Club Nokia during the \"Music for Relief: Concert For the Philippines\" in Los Angeles, California, and raised donations for victims. The show was broadcast on AXS TV on February 15. Other artists during the tour included The Offspring, Bad Religion, Heart, and The Filharmonic.\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.linkinpark.com/main\n\nGenres: Alternative rock, nu metal, rap rock, pop\n\nCurrent members:\nRob Bourdon \u2013 drums, percussion (since 1996)\nBrad Delson \u2013 lead guitar (since 1996)\nDave Farrell \u2013 bass (1996\u20131998, 1999, since 2001)\nJoe \"Mr. Hahn\" Hahn \u2013 turntables, programming, samples (since 1996)\nMike Shinoda \u2013 vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboard (since 1996).\n\nFormer members:\n\nChester Bennington \u2013 vocals (1999-2017)\nMark Wakefield - vocals (1996\u20131998)\nKyle Christener - bass (1999)\nScott Koziol - bass (2000\u20132001).\n\nDiscography:\n\nAlbums:\n1.

overdosed\nThey've been waiting patiently for pinnochio to poke his nose\nBack into the game and they know rap will never be the same as before\nBashing in the brains of these hoes and establishing a name as he goes\nThe passion of the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it\nThis shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot\nYou dealin' with a few true

me.\nPlease don't be scared of me.\nI remember you.\nThis feeling isnt new.\nSo please don't be scared of me.\nPlease don't be scared of me.\nOh oh oh oh oh uhh.\n\n[Verse 3:]\nLook.\nFuck all ya'll.\nWe ignore villains here.\nPremature millionaires.\nWelcome to my realest year.\nYeah.\nI swear we making a killah here.\nI should be on top of the world here just chillen here.\nUh.\nBut it's funny having fans.\nWho find you before anybody ever has the chance, and build you up so you could be the biggest in the game.\nAnd realize when your there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same.\nYeah.\nAnd plus things are just so real at home\nPeople think I've changed just because my appilla grown\nAnd now security follow me everywhere so I'm never actually am alone, I just always feel alone.\nI think I'm scared of what the future holds.\nI was wishing for some things and now am used to those.\nEvery girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes.\nThe honesty of my music has left me too exposed.\nAll my old friends think I got a new crowd.\nAnd people seem to notice every time I do smile.\nI guess that mean they come few and far between.\nEven though am living out what you would call the dream.\nYeah.\nAnd my uncle ain't even messaging me.\nAnd him missing in my life is kind of messing with me.\nI hope this isnt one of those forever things.\nIt's funny how money can change everything.\n\n[Chorus:]\nDon't believe the lies.\nLook me in my eyes.\nPlease don't be scared of me.\nPlease don't be scared of me.\nI remember you.\nThis feeling isnt new.\nSo please don't be scared of me.\nPlease don't be scared of me.\nOh oh oh oh oh uhh.", "youtube": {"duration": 244, "date_published": "2010-04-17 17:55:20", "video_id": "DcQzATCJpBA", "description": "hope you enjoy:)"},

Drake shot to global fame upon the release of his critically acclaimed 2009 mixtape So Far Gone and Best I Ever Had, a single from the mixtape which peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nDrake's music career began in 2006 with the release of his debut mixtape room for improvement. The tape featured collaborations with Trey Songz, Lupe Fiasco and Nikelus F and marked the beginning of a long-time partnership with Canadian producer boi-1da. The mixtape sold 6,000 physical copies in the year of its release.\n\ncomeback season, Drake's second official mixtape, was released in 2007 and featured the single replacement girl. The track featured vocals from Trey Songz and received heavy rotation on MTV and BET television networks. robin thicke, clipse and rich boy featured on the mixtape, however it was Man of the Year - a track recorded with future mentor lil wayne - which signified the start of a close affiliation between Drake and Lil' Wayne's recording label Young Money Entertainment.\n\nIn 2009, Drake released his highly anticipated third mixtape so far gone to critical acclaim and commercial success. Its lead single, Best I Ever Had, peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and has since been certified double platinum by the RIAA. The success of the track lead to a highly publicised bidding war between several record labels to sign Drake. The rapper eventually signed a deal with Young Money Entertainment in the summer of 2009 and released an official EP version of the mixtape soon after; eventually receiving Gold status for shipments of 500,000 units.\n\nThis astronomical rise to success continued into 2010 with the release of his major label debut album thank me later. After several setbacks from its original October 2009 release date, the album was released on June 15th 2010 preceded by lead single over, which peaked at #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at #1 on the Hot Rap Songs chart. The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard Album Chart and has since been certified Platinum by the RIAA for sales of approximately 1,100,000 copies in the US to date. It produced three further singles which attained chart success; Find Your Love, Miss Me (feat. Lil' Wayne) and fancy (feat. T.I. & Swizz Beatz).\n\nDrake released his second album 'Take Care' in November 2011 and it critically and commercially was very successful.The album spawned eight singles including the immensely popular The Motto which introduced the term 'YOLO' to the mainstream. With features from Lil Wayne, Rihanna, Kendrick Lamar, Nicki Minaj and more the album went 2x platinum in the United States and in Canada, but only managing gold in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn November 2013 Drake released the highly anticipated 'Nothing Was The Same'  which was also very critically and commercially succesful and has since spawned seven singles. Jay Z is the only other rapper to appear on the standard version of the album. Drake said about the album \"Take Care was about connecting with my city and connecting with my past and sort of still feeling guilty that I'm not in love with one of these girls that cared about me from back in the day. Now, I'm 26, I'm with my friends, I'm making jobs for people, I'm making memories for people that will last a lifetime. I don't need to be in love right now. I don't need these things that I maybe once thought that I needed to feel normal and feel righteous about myself. I think for the first time in an album I'm content\u2014not satisfied\u2014but proud of where I'm at as a person.\"\n\nDrake announced in July 2014 that his next album would be titled 'Views from the 6', though no release date has been given. However, in February 2015, with no prior announcement, Drake released 'If You're Reading This It's Too Late' on iTunes. This marked Drake's fourth retail release with his record label Cash Money Records. Despite stating the release as a mix-tape it was made available for purchase on iTunes. As of August 2015, 'If You're Reading This It's Too Late' has sold over 1 million copies. Drake is the first artist to pass the Platinum album status in 2015.\n\nDrake released his fourth album, Views, in 2016, breaking numerous chart records in the process. Views sat atop the Billboard 200 for ten nonconsecutive weeks, becoming the first album by a solo male to do so in over 10 years. It also saw Drake leading the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 simultaneously for eight weeks, breaking the previous record of seven held by both Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston. It also achieved triple platinum status in the U.S., and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release. One of the tracks,  One Dance, became Drake's first #1 single on the Hot 100, spending ten weeks on top of the chart.\n\nDrake released the multi-genre More Life in 2017. Described by Drake as a playlist, it was his seventh consecutive No. 1 on the Billboard 200, and set multiple streaming records. More Life received generally positive reviews and debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, becoming his seventh consecutive number one album, while also breaking several streaming records.\n\n2) Drake is a Polish sea shanty band founded in 2004. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Drake\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released on June 22, 2012 by Interscope Records as the fourth single of the album. Charting across Europe, the single reached the top ten in Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, and Switzerland. In the spring of 2013, \"Summertime Sadness\" became a number-one hit in Poland and Ukraine. Trap and house remixes of \"Summertime Sadness\" helped Del Rey break into the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart. There, it became a modest hit and marked Del Rey's first foray into the chart. On the accompanied Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart, the single gave Del Rey her first US number-one single in August 2013. Earlier in 2012, the song also managed to become a rock hit in the US.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, a remixed version of the track by Cedric Gervais was released to American contemporary hit radio and helped the single become a sleeper hit, debuting it at 72 on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming the highest charting single of her career in that country with a peak of 6. Switzerland and Austria gave \"Summertime Sadness\" a gold certification; it reached platinum status in Germany and became a top forty year-end hit. The record also reached number 4 in the UK Singles Chart. It joined BBC Radio 1's and BBC Radio 2's playlists. Gervais' remixed version won a 2014 Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical.\n\nA music video for the trip hop song features two lovers, one played by Jaime King and the other played by Del Rey. As the storyline progresses, both characters commit suicide by jumping from perilous heights. Cinematography was handled primarily by King's husband, Kyle Newman. The video gained success on video-hosting website, YouTube, and circulated through social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter. In general, critics lauded the artistry of the single's music video, comparing it to Instagram. The musical arrangement was composed by Del Rey's long-time collaborators Emile Haynie and Rick Nowels, with Nowels and Del Rey writing the lyrics. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lana+Del+Rey/_/Summertime+Sadness\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Released on 23 April 2013, it was the first single from the The Great Gatsby: Music from Baz Luhrmann's Film soundtrack. An alternative rock ballad, \"Young and Beautiful\" was co-written by Del Rey and the track's producer, Rick Nowels.  Contemporary music critics lauded the single, calling it \"haunting\" and \"somber\". Lyrically, \"Young and Beautiful\" follows a young lover's apprehension about whether love can last.

Beginning by taking a part in the Broadway musical 13 in 2008, Grande later landed the role Cat Valentine on the Nickelodeon hit TV shows Victorious (2010-2013), and its spin off, Sam & Cat (2013-2014).\n\nGrande reached mainstream success in March 2013 after her debut single \"The Way\" (featuring Mac Miller) from her debut studio album Yours Truly (2013), became a Top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hit. The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nIn August 2014, Grande released her second studio album My Everything, which became her second number one album in the US. Its lead single, \"Problem\" (featuring Iggy Azalea), reached number two on Billboard Hot 100 and became one of the best-selling digital singles of all time. With four Top 10 hit singles from the album, Grande spent 34 continuous weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 and had the most top 10 singles of any artist in 2014. All of five singles from My Everything were certified Platinum or better by RIAA.\n\nIn May 2016, Grande released her third studio album, Dangerous Woman. It was her first album to not hit number-one on Billboard 200. The lead single, Dangerous Woman, debuted at number 10 on Billboard Hot 100, making Grande the first person in the history of that chart to have the lead single from each of her first three albums debut in the top 10.\n\nGrande has released Holiday music, Christmas Kisses (2013), which included \"Santa Tell Me\" (2014) in the exclusive re-release in Japan, and Christmas & Chill (2015), which debuted at number thirty-four on Billboard 200 chart with 27,000 digital copies. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ariana+Grande\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song is featured on the group's debut album Hot Fuss and was written by Brandon Flowers and Dave Keuning.\nIt was named \"Song of the Decade\" by UK radio stations Absolute Radio and XFM, and in April 2010 Last.fm revealed that it was the most listened to track since the launch of the online music service, with over 12.2 million plays scrobbled. In October 2010, it was voted ninth in the Greatest Guitar Riffs of the 21st Century so far by Total Guitar magazine. It is The Killers' best-selling song in the US where it has sold over 3 million copies.\n\n\n\nHistory\n\nLyrically \"Mr. Brightside\" depicts the jealousy and paranoia of a male who suspects his significant other is deliberately cheating on him. The song is inspired by an unfaithful ex-girlfriend of frontman Brandon Flowers. Dave Keuning composed the verses to this song before meeting Flowers, Flowers wrote lyrics and composed the chorus after hearing Dave's ideas. In the November of the year 2001, the group had recorded \"Mr. Brightside\" along with three other demos including \"Desperate\", \"Replaceable\", and \"Under the Gun\" at Mike Sak's Kill the Messenger Studio in Henderson, Nevada. They handed out this demo for free during their shows in the year 2002.\n\"Mr. Brightside\" became a popular song within the Las Vegas music scene with one reviewer calling it a \"feel-good anthem that ranks as one of the best local tracks in a long time.\" After signing with UK indie label Lizard King Records, the track was sent to radio as a buzz single and it received frequent spins by influential BBC Radio 1 DJ's Zane Lowe and Steve Lamacq as well as being playlisted by XFM. In a glowing review, NME said the song was filled with \"ambition, sex, and noise\".\nThe earliest demo of the song can be found on YouTube, Mark Stoermer and Ronnie Vannucci were not members of the band when this demo was recorded. Bass is played by Dave Keuning and drums by Matt Norcross. A later demo featuring all band members can also be found,[8] as well as the first official version.\nA remix of the song by Stuart Price was featured on The Killers' 2007 B-side and rarities compilation Sawdust. During the tour for Brandon Flowers' solo record, he performed the remix version with Stuart Price during his show at Brixton Academy and has since performed it on his tour as the show closer, again in the remix form. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Killers/_/Mr.+Brightside\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song is featured on the group's debut album Hot Fuss and was written by Dave Keuning, Ronnie Vannucci Jr., Mark Stoermer and Brandon Flowers.\n\nLead singer Brandon Flowers refers to this song as \"Our most Vegas-influenced song on the album. Sin city, The Strip. It's where I grew up and of course it affects the songs I write. This song has a lot of sexual energy.\"\n\nWhen The Killers first started out, their music was little noticed by music-buyers and the media, which is why \"Somebody Told Me\" has been released twice in slightly different forms. The first, with the pink background cover, is the rarer version of the single as it was their first release of it; due to poor sales not as many were produced. When re-released, the cover-art sported a blue background colour and is the more common version of the single.\n\nThe single peaked at #51 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The re-issued, blue edition of the single peaked at #3 in the UK.\n\nIn Australia, the song was ranked #4 on Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2004.\n\nIn 2009 it was voted at Number 18 in UK radio station XFM's \"100 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nThe music video for \"Somebody Told Me\", directed by Brett Simon, simply shows The Killers performing their song in the moonlight of a desert location, with a giant LED screen displaying rolling, flashing images of their logo, as well as an alternate version of the video shot during the day, presumably in the same location. The concept is very similar to the video for \"Crystal\" by New Order, which features a fictional band called The Killers miming the New Order song in front of a large video screen flashing random colours and images. It was from this video that The Killers got their band name, so the similarities are likely an intentional homage.\n\n\nBillboard called the song \" wildly infectious,\" and \"as addictive as nickel slots.\" Blender said the single is a \"superb blaze of synthesizers and guitars that builds to the year's best one-liner: 'Somebody told me you had a boyfriend who looked like a girlfriend I had in February of last year.'\" Entertainment Weekly hailed the single as \"three smashingly punchy minutes of garage pop so tightly wound that singer Brandon Flowers seems to be accusing his girl of cheating on him with another woman, is the song worth downloading.\" Rolling Stone said the single was a \"nightclub anthem in the making\" and continued, \"the acid-tongued 'Somebody Told Me' blasts into outer space on a wave of synthesizers and singer Brandon Flowers' cheeky chorus.\n\nRichard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine covered this song into a Lounge style on their 2005 album Aperitif for Destruction. He sings the song in a drunken manner and, near the end of the song, he apparently runs to the bathroom to puke. The song was also covered by Daniel Bedingfield as part of a Radio 1 Live Lounge session.\n\nIt was also covered by Charlotte Church and Alesha Dixon on The Charlotte Church Show.\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic also included this song in \"Polkarama\" from Straight Outta Lynwood.\n\nThere is a parody of this song by ApologetiX called \"Somebody Sold Me.\"\n\nOn 9 October 2009, JLS appeared on the BBC One chat show Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]], where they performed an acapella version of the song.\n\n    * The song is heard in the film Rocky Balboa when Rocky Jr. is in the bar and sees the computer simulated fight.\n    * The song is a playable song on the music video game Rock Revolution.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Killers/_/Somebody+Told+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was released as the lead single from that album in September 2006. It has proven to be one of their most successful singles, peaking at #14 on the U.S. Hot 100 (only \"Mr. Brightside\" peaked higher on this chart at #10), as well as their only number 1 to date on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks. It is also their highest charting single to date in the United Kingdom and Australia, peaking at numbers 2 and 10 respectively.\n\nThe song, that is in the key of B major and written in common time, displays the band's move towards a more \"American\" musical style, as it is part of an album that was supposedly heavily influenced by the music of Bruce Springsteen. The song itself was reportedly influenced by Springsteen's \"Born to Run\". The song was nominated for the 2007 Grammy Award for \"Best Rock Song\", and the single's video, directed by Anthony Mandler, received a nomination in the category of \"Best Short Form Music Video\". The single was ranked #69 on iTunes Top 100 Best Sellers: Songs of 2006. The song also made #4 on the Triple J Hottest 100, 2006.\n\nThe song has been covered by Coldplay live at an unplanned appearance for MENCAP, as well as by Finnish singer Astrid Swan, and Taking Back Sunday. It was also covered by Simon Webbe, a former member of British boy band Blue on Jo Whiley's Show on Radio 1 in the Live Lounge. On the 25th of March 2009, the song was once again covered, this time by The Noisettes.\n\nThe song appears in the video games Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, SingStar Amped, and Rock Band.\n\nThe song was featured in the third section of the 2006 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show and is played regularly before Baltimore Orioles games at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.\n\nIn 2009 it was voted at Number 37 in UK radio station XFM's \"100 Greatest Songs of All Time\". http://www.xfm.co.uk/onair/shows/xfms-top-100-songs-of-all-time.\n\nThe music video for this song was filmed in Tlayacapan, Mexico.\n\nIn a frame story, it tells the story of a Mexican woman around the age of 20. The video opens with her arriving at a large, white, wooden cross in the desert. She mourns in front of it until her supposed husband shows up and comforts her. In the next scene, she is praying at a church; after leaving, she meets up with her husband. One day she arrives home to find her husband in bed with another woman; seeing them together, she runs out crying, with her husband running out after her. The video flashes back to their wedding as she runs away. After showing the woman washing herself, the video cuts to a bar, which the woman enters. She sits at the same table as her future husband and the woman with whom he later cheats on her with. As they introduce themselves, the other woman leaves. The band is playing in the bar, and the girl looks at Flowers as he sings the last verse, but turns away as the video ends. The final shot is of the cross that the woman visited in the first scene, with the woman still on the ground and the man there with her.\n\nThere is also an alternate version of the video in which the woman jumps off a cliff instead of reconciling with the husband. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Killers/_/When+You+Were+Young\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song appears on their debut album Hot Fuss. It was released as the third single in 2005 in the UK and as the fourth single in the US. It features a memorable extended chorus of \"I got soul but I'm not a soldier...\", a phrase now associated with the song; this was quoted by Robbie Williams during his performance of \"Let Me Entertain You\" during Live 8 on July 2, 2005. The single peaked at 74 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at 18 in the UK Singles Chart. It was the only song the band performed at Live 8.\n\nThe song was featured in the closing credits of the 2005 film The Matador, as well as the 2007 movie Southland Tales as a crucial part of the storyline in which Pilot Abilene (played by Justin Timberlake) lip-synchs it. It was also mentioned in the graphic novel preceding the film, Southland Tales: The Prequel Saga. It also played over the opening of the pilot of the television series Jericho. It is heard at the end of the 2008 Ben Stein film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed. The song plays in virtually its entirety over the first segment of the first episode of the 2008 PBS documentary series \"Carrier.\" Nike used the song in a commercial for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Following this Nike ad, the song rose as high as #38 on iTunes.\n\nLike \"Mr. Brightside\", the song features two videos. The earlier version features The Killers singing while walking down Brick Lane in London accompanied by a crowd. The video also featured shots of the audience who attended The Killers concert at the London Astoria on July 8, 2004. The later version, directed by Dutch photographer Anton Corbijn, features a surreal, dream-like sequence where the Killers, dressed as cowboys, are attacked by scantily-clad female warriors armed with boomerangs. The story in the video is told out of order, but can be put in its order by the numbers displayed in the video. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Killers/_/All+These+Things+That+I%27ve+Done\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was written by lead vocalist Brandon Flowers and bassist Mark Stoermer.\n\nIt reached #11 in the UK single chart and #15 in the Billboard U.S. Modern Rock Chart. It also received substantial radioplay in Australia, where it was ranked #39 on Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2004.\n\nThe band claims that they wrote the song in 8 minutes.\n\nThe song originally featured on the Mr. Brightside EP released in September 2003.\n\nThe music video for this song shows ghostly figures of the band wandering around a house that the characters of the song presumably used to live in. While Flowers sings to the camera, flashbacks of the old house are shown behind him, including a children's party, a Christmas morning, a high school party, and a funeral. While these extras are oblivious to being watched, at the end they turn to the camera to look at the viewer while the band fades away.\n\nBillboard said the song \"seems to deal with coming to terms with growing up and getting older.\"\n\nChuck Arnold with People magazine called the song \"a sardonic moper worthy of the Smiths.\" Billboard said the single is \"more restrained and downtempo compared with the band's previous hits\" but otherwise \"pretty upbeat and is awash with soaring new wave synthesizers and 'killer' guitars.\" In the UK the song was voted at 91 on Absolute Radio's 100 Best Songs of the Decade. \n\nDavid Gray performed an acoustic version of \"Smile Like You Mean It\" on BBC's Radio 1 in the Live Lounge. Tally Hall covered the song for the sixth The O.C. soundtrack: Music from the OC: Mix 6.\n\nThe song was released as a downloadable track for the music video game series Rock Band on November 25, 2008.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Killers/_/Smile+Like+You+Mean+It\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It peaked at #62 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also charted at #15 on the UK singles chart.\nIn 2009 it was voted at Number 57 in UK radio station XFM's \"100 Greatest Songs of All Time\".\nThe same year it was voted at Number 71 on another UK Radio Station Absolute Radio's 100 Best Songs Of The Decade. In an interview with Chicago radio station Q101, lead vocalist Brandon Flowers called \"Read My Mind\" the best song he has ever written. This is also seen by critics as one of the best, if not the best, Killers song to date.\nNeil Tennant and Chris Lowe (of Pet Shop Boys) saw The Killers in concert at Brixton Academy at the end of November 2006, where the idea of a remix for \"Read My Mind\" was discussed between the two parties. The resulting remix, \"Pet Shop Boys 'Stars are blazing' mix\" featuring additional vocals by Tennant and Lowe, is one of the B-sides for the single, and is featured on the Pet Shop Boys album Disco Four. This song was released as part of an iTunes EP on February 13, 2007, featuring an acoustic version and two remixes. It was also released as the third single from Sam's Town in the United Kingdom on February 26, 2007. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Killers/_/Read+My+Mind\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is featured as the first track on The Killers' first album, Hot Fuss. It was written by Brandon Flowers and Mark Stoermer.\n\nDespite not being a single, \"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine\" is one of The Killers' most popular and critically acclaimed songs. It is particularly praised for Stoermer's powerful and melodic bassline.\n\nThe song, which is written in the key of E-flat minor, is told from the point of view of a boy who has been taken in for questioning about a girl's (Jenny) murder. After explaining the incident from his perspective, the boy (voiced by Flowers), claims that he is innocent by saying that \"there ain't no motive for this crime, Jenny was a friend of mine.\" The song has no resolution of the crime and it is never clarified if the boy was guilty. The song was inspired by Robert Chambers' defense of the Jennifer Levin murder charges, in which Chambers claimed he had no motive for the murder, and that he and the victim were \"friends\".\n\nIt is a part of The Killers' alleged \"Murder Trilogy\", three songs detailing the murder of a girl named Jenny, the other two being \"Midnight Show\", and \"Leave the Bourbon on the Shelf\". In an interview with The Guardian, Flowers revealed that it was Morrissey's song \"Sister I'm a Poet\" that inspired him to write songs about murder. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Killers/_/Jenny+Was+a+Friend+of+Mine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Killers is an American rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2001 and consist of Brandon Flowers (vocals, keyboards), Dave Keuning (guitar, backing vocals), Mark Stoermer (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Ronnie Vannucci Jr. (drums, percussion). The band's four studio albums to date have sold in excess of 18 million copies worldwide combined. The band got its name from the fictional band \"The Killers\" in the video for New Order's \"Crystal\". The band was on hiatus, but returned to the studio to record their 4th studio album in early 2011. Songfacts reports that \"Runaways\", the first single from \"Battle Born\", was released on July 10, 2012. \nInitially, The Killers played at large clubs in Las Vegas. With the band's line-up stable and their repertoire of songs expanding, the band began to attract attention from talent bookers, local agents, major label, scouts \u2014 and a UK representative for Warner Bros. Though the Warner Bros representative passed on the band, he took the demo back with him, showing it to a friend who worked at UK (London-based) indie label Lizard King Records (now Marrakesh Records). The Killers then signed in the summer of 2002 to a British label.\nThey released their debut album \"Hot Fuss\" on June 2004 in the United Kingdom and US (on Island Records). Their first single was \"Somebody Told Me\". The band also had chart success with their singles \"Mr. Brightside,\" which reached the Top 10 in the UK when released, and \"All These Things That I've Done\".\nThe band started recording its second album, \"Sam's Town\" on February 15, 2006, at The Palms Hotel/Casino in Las Vegas. It was released on October 2006. Lead singer, Brandon Flowers said that Sam's Town is \"one of the best albums of the past 20 years\". Though the album has received a mixed response from critics and fans, it has still remained popular and sold over 4 million copies worldwide.\nThe first single, \"When You Were Young\" debuted on radio stations in late July 2006. In late August 2006, it was offered as a downloadable track before the album's debut. The single then entered the chart on downloads alone at #5, and the following week on its official release went to #2 in the UK. The video clip of the second single, \"Bones\", was directed by Tim Burton. The third single was \"Read My Mind\". The video was filmed in Tokyo, Japan. The last one was \"For Reasons Unknown\" released in June, 2007.\nThe album sold over 700,000 copies worldwide in the first week of release, with a No. 2 debut on the United World chart. Brandon Flowers announced on August 22, 2007, in Belfast, Northern Ireland, at the T Vital Festival, that it would be the last time that the album \"Sam's Town\" would be played in Europe. The Killers played their last Sam's Town concert in Melbourne, Australia on November, 2007.\nMuch of The Killers' music is based on British influences and on the music of the 1980s, particularly New Wave. Flowers has also said in interviews that the larger-than-life sound of many of the band's songs is due to the influence of living in Las Vegas, a city where everything is about flash and who can top whom. They appreciate post-punk bands that sprang up during the 80's such as Joy Division, and they are also avowed fans of New Order (with whom Flowers has performed live), Pet Shop Boys, Dire Straits, David Bowie, The Smiths, Morrissey, Depeche Mode, U2, Queen, Oasis and The Beatles. Their second album was said to be greatly influenced by Bruce Springsteen's music and lyrics.\nThe compilation album called \"Sawdust\", containing B-sides, rarities, and some new material, was released on November 12, 2007. The album's first single \"Tranquilize,\" a collaboration with Lou Reed, was released on October 2007. The band also released their cover of Joy Division's \"Shadowplay\" on the U.S. iTunes Store. The album also contains the songs \"Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town\" (a The First Edition cover), \"Romeo and Juliet\" (a Dire Straits cover), and a new version of \"Move Away\" (previously available on the Spider-Man 3 soundtrack). One of the tracks on Sawdust is \"Leave the Bourbon On The Shelf\" the first but previously unreleased part of the so called \"Murder Trilogy,\" in which it is followed by \"Midnight Show\" then \"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine\"\nThe Cowboys' Christmas Ball Songfacts reports that The Killers are recognized for their work with Bono's Product Red campaign, which is dedicated to fighting AIDS in Africa. In 2006 they released their first Christmas themed song and music video, \"A Great Big Sled\" in aid of the charity,followed by \"Don't Shoot Me Santa\" on December 1, 2007. Their festive tunes have subsequently became an annual event and \"The Cowboy's Christmas Ball\" was released as their sixth successive release intended to raise money for the Product Red campaign on December 1, 2011.\n\"Day and Age\" was the title of The Killers third studio album. The title was confirmed in an NME video interview at Reading and Leeds Festival with lead singer Brandon Flowers. The band headed to the studio in June and the album is being produced by Stuart Price. In the October 2008 edition of German magazine Musikexpress, in an article dated August 15, 2008, Keuning says the new record was 99% finished. The Killers selected Paul Normansell to do the artwork for the new album, which should include some of Normansell's artwork and portraits of the band themselves. \nFlowers also stated in an interview with Q that he was excited to play a new song called \"Tidal Wave\", influenced by David Bowie's \"Drive-In Saturday\" and \"I Drove All Night\" by Roy Orbison. The setlist of The Killers' July 29 and August 1, 2008 show at New York City's Highline Ballroom and Atlantic City's Borgata Hotel and Spa contained two new songs: Spaceman and Neon Tiger. These songs were also played at The Killers' show on July 31st at the MGM Grand at Foxwoods Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut. Spaceman and Neon Tiger are also included on \"Day and Age\". During their brief summer tour in 2008, The Killers confirmed several other potential song titles for \"Day and Age\" including \"Goodnight, Travel Well\", \"Vibration\", \"Joy Ride\", \"I Can't Stay\", \"Losing Touch\", \"Fairytale Dustland\" and \"Human\", although \"Vibration\" wasn't included.\nThe Killers' third studio album \"Day and Age\" (which was reviewed at http://www.silentsoundwaves.com/album-reviews/the-killers-day-age-review/) was released on 25th November 2008 (24th November for the UK). The album's first single \"Human\" was debuted on 22nd September and on the 30th September, the single was made available on iTunes, with many radio DJ's suggesting it was the best single by The Killers yet.\nKillers frontman Brandon Flowers recently (December 2008) has said that he thinks his band will be bigger than U2 eventually, and sooner than you might think. He told The Daily Telegraph that \"U2 are unbelievable, but they're getting old. It feels like it's time\". \nThe Killers' fourth studio album, Battle Born, was released 18 September 2012. It took 15 months to record. The band began recording it after they took a touring break for a little over a year. The album has five producers, with The Killers producing one song by themselves, \"The Rising Tide.\" The debut single was \"Runaways,\" followed by \"Miss Atomic Bomb,\" \"Here with Me,\" and \"The Way it Was.\"\nwww.thekillersmusic.com\n\n2) The Killers was a Uruguayan rock band from the early 1970s which realeased one album in 1972.\n\n3) The Killers was an American hardcore band from Chicago, IL, from the 1990s founded by former members of Charles Bronson.

With just\u00a0half a semester left of business school, breakout artist\u00a0DJ Vanic\u00a0did exactly that when he decided to pursue a full-time career in music. Without knowing exactly what it would lead to, the Vancouver based producer took a chance and boy did it pay off.&quot;Family and personal issues came up in my life that\u00a0made me re-evaluate my goals and direction,&quot; Vanic told\u00a0Forbes.com. &quot;I decided that I might as well spend my youth trying for something really cool and different, something I was passionate about. And music was the obvious choice, it&#39;s been one of the biggest parts of my life since I was 3 years old.&quot;\u00a0In as little as two years,\u00a0Vanic quickly made his mark. He took the festival circuit by storm and already managed to play the coveted\u00a0Coachella\u00a0music festival last year.\u00a0You&#39;re probably one of the millions of people who had his remix of Zella Day&#39;s hit single &quot;Hypnotic&quot; on repeat, which he dropped a few months ahead of his debut in the desert. Since then,\u00a0he&#39;s released originals of his own, including his latest track featuring Clara Mae &quot;Staring At the Sun,&quot;\u00a0which exudes the same high-energy as his live sets.\u00a0&quot;Clara sent over the vocal and I fell in love with it,&quot; he shared. &quot;The whole process took probably over a year though, because we kept changing the drop style and re-writing verses. As with any song I work on, it&#39;s the vocal itself that usually inspires me \u2014 whatever the singer makes me feel, I try to replicate that in the music.&quot;\u00a0\u00a0Though it appears his success happened overnight, that certainly wasn&#39;t the case. Vanic opened up\u00a0about how he&#39;s nowhere near where he wants to be skill wise and the importance of continuing to hustle.\u00a0&quot;I&#39;ve never claimed to be an amazing DJ,&quot; he humbly said. &quot;It&#39;s hard to keep creating music that is true to my own sound, but still unique and not repetitive. Though it&#39;s a challenge, I love the struggle behind it, otherwise I wouldn&#39;t be doing it.&quot;\u00a0A stepping stone that propelled his career was the moment\u00a0he signed onto Disruptor Records, the label headed by\u00a0The Chainsmokers&#39; manager, Adam Alpert. Vanic&#39;s own manager\u00a0Sebastian Barwinski (The Standard Group)\u00a0encouraged him to take that next step\u00a0and has backed Vanic\u00a0ever since he decided to make the move. &quot;\u00a0I have a really amazing team of people who help ensure everything in my life and business as Vanic falls into place,&quot; he revealed. &quot;Adam and Disruptor were the right fit. Everything they do seems to be spot on, and they&#39;re really good people to work with.&quot;\u00a0Up next, you can expect\u00a0way more new music from EDM&#39;s rising star. &quot;I have a couple remixes and a few more originals all being wrapped up,&quot; Vanic confirmed. &quot;I&#39;m hoping to release all of them throughout the summer and fall. Then I&#39;ll spend the rest of the time playing, traveling, DJ-ing, and hitting up festivals. After that we will be getting into another full headline tour across North America.&quot;\u00a0Vanic recently\u00a0played Houston&#39;s\u00a0Free Press Summer Fest\u00a0last\u00a0weekend and is scheduled to perform at\u00a0this weekend&#39;s Bonnaroo along with\u00a0Made in America later this year, where he&#39;ll be reunited with The Chainsmokers who are headlining the Philadelphia based event. However, I\u00a0have a feeling there&#39;s plenty more where that came from, this is hands down just the beginning.- FORBES\u00a0\u00a0", "title": "Vanic - Black Masquerade", "url": "http://anchorage.eventful.com/events/vanic-black-masquerade-/E0-001-110594666-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Williwaw", "date": "2018-03-02 21:00:00"}, {"city": "Bloomington", "description": " <br> Bold and electric, THE CADILLAC THREE has proven to be a force with high-energy shows and gritty sonic instincts. The Nashville natives are growing a rabid fanbase across the globe with slots on Superstar tours and sold-out headline stops across Europe. Since being named the 2014 UK Classic Rock Roll of Honour: Best New Band, TC3 became the most played new band on Planet Rock in 2015 with several radio singles and being a staple all on the BBC Radio 2 playlist. A nonstop rollercoaster of touring resulted in every UK show boasting a sell out including concerts at famous venues like O2 Academy Islington, Dingwalls and The Garage. The raucous trio is already near capacity on their upcoming Night Life Religion Tour in the UK and will join Florida Georgia Line, Kip Moore and Chase Rice in the US bringing an &quot;unrefined live show you won&#39;t want to miss&quot; (PASTE). As musical co-conspirators and friends, Jaren Johnston (Guitar & Lead Vocals), Kelby Ray (Bass Steel Guitar, Dobro, Acoustic & Vocals) and Neil Mason (Drums, Percussion & Vocals) have a sound all of their own that hovers between radioready Country anthems, hard-and-heavy Rock ballads and traditional Southern folk. Diversity extends into their songwriting talents, with Grammy-nominated frontman Jaren writing #1 hits for artists such as Keith Urban and Jake Owen while Neil penned their latest offering, &quot;Graffiti,&quot; with Corey Crowder and Luke Dick, showcasing lyrics that echo nostalgia for the band who met in high school. Slated for release in the US and Europe on January 29, TC3 recorded the track at London&#39;s famed Abbey Road Studios as part of a live vinyl release coming later this year. &quot;Graffiti&quot; will impact radio as an official single in the UK on February 5, where they will also film an accompanying music video. &quot;Like Kings of Leon before them, they&#39;re poised for their first big break in the U.K. where they&#39;ve sold out every headlining show for nearly two years before conquering their U.S. home turf,&quot; heralded Rolling Stone. TC3 is set to perform at the CMC Rocks Festival in March, which will mark their first time performing in Australia. With a raw sound like no other, the buzz-worthy band organically builds around Neil&#39;s thundering, melodic percussion and the sinewy intertwining of Jaren&#39;s gruff vocals and guitar with Kelby&#39;s lap steel, all ready to explode at a moments notice. TC3 has appeared on ABC&#39;s hit drama NASHVILLE and their music has been featured on television shows including CSI Miami, Vampire Diaries and Hart Of Dixie. The band&#39;s song &quot;I&#39;m Rockin&#39;&quot; is featured on the new Madden NFL 16 game and soundtrack alongside The Weeknd and LunchMoney Lewis.

But then that wouldnt be consistent with the work ethic demonstrated by the band, which consistently attempts to raise the bar, setting and achieving new goals since forming on the Notre Dame campus in South Bend, Indiana, in 1997. After releasing their eighth studio album, Similar Skin, the first for their own indie label, Nothing Too Fancy (N2F) Music (distributed by RED), the group continued to push the envelope and test the limits. The London Session, was a dream come true for the members having been recorded at the legendary Studio Two at historic Abbey Road. The stealth recording session yielded 10 tracks in a single day, proving once again, the prolific UM waits for no one.As a follow up to The London Session, the envelope pushing continues with the November 11th release of ZONKEY. Umphreys McGee has been arranging and performing original mashups live for over eight years. It was only a matter of when, not if, some of those innovative concoctions would find their way into a studio. An album of 12 unique mashups, conceived and arranged by the band, ZONKEY is as seamless as it bizarre, playful as it is razor sharp. Bits and pieces of classic songs are culled from 40-plus years of popular music from 70s Reggae to 80s Pop to 90s Metal and everywhere in between. From Radiohead mashed with Beck, The Weeknd with Fleetwood Mac, Talking Heads with Bob Marley, Metallica with Gorillaz . . . nothing is off limits.The original Umphreys McGee played a mix of originals and cover songs, waiting just eight months to release their debut album, the cheekily titled Greatest Hits Volume III. Their initial proper recording, Local Band Does OK, came out in 2002, followed shortly afterward by an appearance at the first-ever Bonnaroo in Tennessee, selling more albums than any other band on the bill. The 2007 double album, Live at the Murat, earned a four-star review in Rolling Stone and a Jammy for Best Live Album.Despite attempts at categorizing UM, the band has devoted its craft to making their devoted followers feel as if they are part of something larger, through such technology-fueled innovations as fan-curated sets, the immersive high-end audio offering, Headphones & Snowcones, where the pristine sound of the live soundboard mix is piped wirelessly through high-end personal monitor systems and headphones, as well as making every live show since 2005 available via their live music portal UMLive.net. UM were also the first group to launch its own single-artist streaming service.Finding themselves in London for three shows at the Brooklyn Bowl in June 2014, the idea of recording at Abbey Road was first proposed by Umphreys producer Manny Sanchez, a notion, as Bayliss told Rolling Stone that seemed as likely as being asked to give a sermon at the Vatican.It wasnt a goal, he explains, because it never seemed like a possibility. But never to be bound by what seems possible, UM secured a coveted day at the worlds most famous recording studio and dove in headfirst.Twelve hours after first setting foot in Abbey Road Studios, just before midnight, Umphreys McGee left the historic room with their own new album, The London Session, what Rolling Stone dubs a historical primer, an evolution story inside 51 minutes.This November 11th, prepare to get Zonkeyd. An album unlike any previous Umphreys McGee effort, this unique take on the mash-up concept is yet another example that there arent many places Umphreys McGee wont take you.Umphreys McGee are more than just a rock band through nearly two decades, they have proven to be on the cutting-edge of both music and technology, super-serving their fans through a community that stretches from the campus of Notre Dame to the hallowed halls of Abbey Road.", "title": "Umphrey's McGee", "url": "http://washingtondc.eventful.com/events/umphreys-mcgee-/E0-001-107811555-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "The Anthem", "date": "2018-02-15 19:30:00"}], "description": "The Weeknd, the stage name for Abel Tesfaye, is a Canadian singer-songwriter and producer.\nThe Scarborough, Toronto-born singer, songwriter, and producer doesn't say much outside of his lyrics or personal messages through his social networking sites. Ever since appearing on the scene in late 2010, he's been shrouded in mystery, cultivating a mystique that baffles our gossip-obsessed pop culture. With that said, the 27-year-old alternative R&B phenomenon is an enigma in more ways than one.\n\nFor him, it's not about becoming famous. It's not about becoming rich. It's not about pleasing anyone. It's about being honest, staying true to his art, and diving headfirst into the deep end. History's most impactful artists from Van Gogh and Charles Bukowski to Miles Davis and John Lennon faced both the abyss and the heavens. They knew about sex, drugs, pain, joy, and love, and they weren't afraid to talk about them openly.\n\nOn his three-disc debut for XO/Republic Records, Trilogy, The Weeknd is an open book, revealing\neverything and nothing at the same time. There are moments of ecstatic electronic bliss like the irresistible \"High for This\", and then there's the propulsive poetic paranoia of \"House of Balloons\", which twists a sample Siouxsie and the Banshees' Happy House into a frenetic danceable coup. With an inimitable and divine voice, he sings of hazy nights that turned into hazier mornings and tumultuous trysts that spiraled into eternal longing. However, you can take whatever you want from it. After all, it is art.\n\nHis trip officially began with the release of the nine-song free album House of Balloons in March 2011. It was the first in a series of three-including Thursday and Echoes of Silence-and it immediately set the blog-o-sphere ablaze. Soon after the initial instalment impacted the net, Drake quoted lyrics from the effort on Twitter and linked to the music, becoming the first of many A-list artists to champion it. The two quickly forged a tight friendship and fertile artistic partnership that extended to Drake's team.\n\nAs they grew closer, the superstar MC even enlisted his talents for several tracks on the chart-topping, platinum-selling and Grammy Award winning album Take Care. Most notably, The Weeknd co-wrote, co-produced, and performed on \"Crew Love\", a bona fide hit single from the record. Further collaborating, Drake dropped a transfixing verse on \"The Zone\" from Thursday.\n\nThe artist hit the road for his first sold out headline tour that summer, and the world began to embrace him with open arms from underground bloggers to taste-making music supervisors. \"High for This\" even served as the soundtrack to the trailer for the final season of HBO's long-running series, Entourage, a symbol of his infiltration into the zeitgeist.\n\nMeanwhile, critics and gatekeepers also fell under his spell. Complex dubbed House of Balloons the \"best album of 2011\", and Pitchfork honored it as \"Best New Music\". It conquered year-end lists, including Stereogum, The A.V. Club, The Guardian (UK), and Spin. MTV, BET, Rolling Stone, XXL, and others exalted it with equally high praise, while The Source called him the \"Songbird of his generation\".\n\nIn the midst of everything, other marquee artists began to personally seek out his unique talent, and that was the highest compliment. He created the first formal remix for FLORENCE + THE MACHINE's \"Shake It Out\", and he put his stamp on LADY GAGA's \"Marry the Night\", yielding a seductive and sensual take on the single for Born This Way: The Remixes. The Weeknd also personally cooked up \"Remember You\" the second single for WIZ KHALIFA's anxiously awaited sophomore effort, O.N.I.F.C.\n\nIn the summer of 2012, a groundbreaking strategic alliance between XO, creative collective visionary behind The Weeknd and Republic Records was established. Under this banner, Trilogy compiled House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence in one expansive collection, properly mixed, mastered, and\nfinished for the very first time. The 27 original tracks remain, but there's also a myriad of new material as well to please both the initiated and uninitiated alike. The doorway officially opens into his world with this effort.\n\nThe first single \"Wicked Games\" bleeds brilliantly with a stark and vivid admission that's utterly enthralling. Keyboards resound through airy production as the vocals exude a dark sensuality. The singer admits, \"I love to watch you dance, take you down another level and get you dancing with the devil\", before the unforgettable, unbridled hook, \"Let me motherfucking love you\".\n\nYou're going to motherfucking love him. Live audiences continue to as well. In addition to surprise appearances on DRAKE's Club Paradise tour and a stint supporting FLORENCE + THE MACHINE, he dazzled crowds at the biggest festivals in the world including Coachella, Primavera Sound Festival, and the Wireless Festival in London and on a seemingly endless run of sold out headline gigs. The next chapter has begun though.\n\nComing together, Republic Records and the Canadian XO are paving the way for a revolution. Already, XO has progressed from an intimate Toronto operation into an international player. Everything stems from the music though, and it always will. THE WEEKND addressed fans in an open letter online, \"You will continue to get what you fell in love with, and I will continue to give you what you ask for. No matter what an artist's ego clouds them to believe, you are the reason why I have been able to continue to do what I love to do and that is to entertain you.\" He released his second album, \"Kiss Land\", on September 10, 2013.\n\n(2) Allegedly \"shrouded in mystery\" despite a social media presence (with accompanying photos) on Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, Soundcloud, and YouTube, as well as major support from fellow Torontonian Drake, alternative R&B act the Weeknd -- a solo outlet for vocalist Abel Tesfaye -- surfaced in March 2011 with House of Balloons. A nine-track, 50-minute mixtape made available for free download on the Weeknd website, House of Balloons was based in morose ballads filled with drug references and sexual longing. Sonically, there were clear traces of radio-friendly contemporary R&B \u00e0 la Trey Songz, Jeremih, the-Dream, and Drake, while also appealing to listeners who favored left-of-center, production-over-songcraft exponents like Spacek and Sa-Ra. The mixtape, made by Tesfaye in collaboration with producers Doc McKinney and Illangelo, among others, garnered widespread coverage -- most of which was gushingly positive -- within days of its March 21 release. A second mixtape, Thursday (August 19), preceded several appearances on Drake's album Take Care. Echoes of Silence (December 21), the third Weeknd mixtape, followed just before the end of the year. The following June, \"Crew Love,\" off Take Care, reached the Top Ten of Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart. A few months later, he was featured on another charting single, Wiz Khalifa's \"Remember You.\" \n\n After Tesfaye signed with Universal Republic, the three Weeknd mixtapes were remastered and bundled with three new songs for Trilogy, issued in November 2012. The set debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 chart. The following April, Tesfaye won Juno Awards in the categories of Breakthrough Artist of the Year and R&B/Soul Recording of the Year. Trilogy was certified platinum by the RIAA the next month. Kiss Land, much darker in tone than its title implied, followed in September 2013 and debuted at number two. Out of its several singles, only \"Live For,\" featuring Drake, touched the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart. Tesfaye had much more success with a series of non-album singles that followed. \"Often,\" released in 2014, was a Top Ten R&B/Hip-Hop hit. He was featured on Ariana Grande's \"Love Me Harder,\" which reached the Top Ten of the Hot 100 and went platinum in the U.S. \"Earned It,\" featured in Fifty Shades of Grey, repeated the same feats. In 2015, Tesfaye issued \"The Hills,\" a booming ballad, and \"Can't Feel My Face,\" a disco-funk throwback, as the first two singles from Chapter III. The former cracked the Hot 100 Top 20, while the latter reached the chart's Top 10. ~ Andy Kellman <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Weeknd\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was written by George Michael, one half of the duo. The song has been covered by many artists throughout the years.\nOriginal version\n\n[edit]Chart performances\nWham! had been a dominant force in the UK Singles Chart in 1984 and news that they were planning a Christmas single meant that a battle for the coveted Christmas #1 spot in the UK seemed set to be between Wham! and the year's other big act, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, who had achieved a third #1 in early December with \"The Power of Love\". However, the Band Aid project, helmed by Bob Geldof, produced the #1 single. Wham!'s offering peaked at #2 for much of the period, although George's involvement in Band Aid meant that Wham! still had an input. Wham! subsequently topped the monies raised by Band Aid by donating all of their \"Last Christmas/Everything She Wants\" royalties to the Ethiopian famine appeal.\n\"Last Christmas\" did make #1 in various other countries.\nThe single sold well over a million copies and became the biggest selling single in UK chart history not to reach #1. A year later, it was re-issued for Christmas again (this time without a billed flip-side) and got to #6. A second re-issue at Christmas 1986 - by which time Wham! had split - stalled outside the top 40.\nThe song gradually sold in Japan, and finally became the best-selling single that did not reach that country's top-10 chart, selling more than 600,000 copies and peaking on the chart at #12 in 1992.\nSince 1997, the song enters the German Singlecharts every year and peaked at #4 in 2007. In the airplay charts the songs enters every year the Top 5.\nIn 2007, the track re-entered the UK Top 20 and hit the UK iTunes Top 10.\nIn 2008, the song re-entered the UK Singles Chart again, this time at #36 and peaked at #26.\nIn 2009, the song re-entered the UK Singles Chart at number #39.\n[edit]\"Can't Smile Without You\" settlement\nDue to perceived similarities between \"Last Christmas\" and the song \"Can't Smile Without You\" as popularised by Barry Manilow, an out of court settlement was reached in which the first year's royalties were donated to the one-year-old \"Band Aid\" charity.[citation needed]\n[edit]Music video\nThe video to \"Last Christmas\" saw George and partner Andrew Ridgeley accompanying girlfriends to see friends at their home in an unspecified ski resort, although the cable-car that can be seen in two shots is from Saas-Fee, Switzerland. It became clear early on, however, that Andrew's girlfriend had previously been in a relationship with George, and it was to her character the song was aimed. The video also featured the duo's erstwhile backing singers Pepsi and Shirlie and Spandau Ballet bassist Martin Kemp, the boyfriend and future husband of Shirlie Holliman. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wham%21/_/Last+Christmas\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

More Wham hits here: http://smarturl.it/Wham_Spotify?IQid=WhamBB 'Listen without Prejudice/MTV Unplugged' \u2013 OUT NOW...."}, "description": "\"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\" is a song by English pop duo Wham! which was released in 1984 and became their first UK number one hit. It was written and produced by George Michael, one half of the duo.\n\nMichael's inspiration for the song was a scribbled note left by his Wham! partner Andrew Ridgeley for Andrew's parents, originally intended to read \"wake me up before you go\" but with \"up\" accidentally written twice, so Ridgeley wrote \"go\" twice on purpose. Released in May 1984, it heralded the beginning of a softer, sunnier image for Wham!, who had spent the previous year as a moodier, more politically themed duo, with songs about unemployment, young marriage, and battles of will between parents and their children. With the release of \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\", they re-emerged with wider smiles, more colourful clothing, and a more positive disposition in interviews.\n\nThe song entered the UK singles chart at number four \u2014 after much hype from the duo claiming they would go straight in at number one, which was a rare occurrence then \u2014 and climbed to the top seven days later, staying there for three weeks.\n\nThe song also went to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in the USA and Michael followed it up with a solo single, \"Careless Whisper\" and another Wham! hit, \"Freedom\", both of which were also UK number-one hits. The album, Make It Big, was an unqualified success. Wham! had three more UK number one singles and split at their height in 1986.\n\nAnother band, Babs & The Bopettes, sang phonetically by Tress MacNeille as Babs Bunny along with her friends, Gail Matthius as Shirley the Loon, Kath Soucie as Fifi Le Fume and Cree Summer as Mary Melody. The \"Jitterbug!\" part is by Charles Adler as Buster Bunny, Joe Alaskey as Plucky Duck and Don Messick as Hamton J. Pig. The chorus is when Babs Bunny lectures Gogo Dodo to wake Babs up before Gogo does. At the end, she laughs and says, \"Well c'mon, do you want me to see Buster, or not?\".\n\nThe music video, essentially the duo performing (it also introduced Ridgeley as a guitar player for the band) to a teenage audience, was memorable for the clothes, which became a lasting sartorial image for the 1980s as a decade. Michael and Ridgeley, plus backing singers Pepsi and Shirlie, along with motor trade Guru Peter (Froudy) Froud, were wearing Katharine Hamnett T-shirt designs which said \"CHOOSE LIFE\" (originally a slogan targeted at drug abuse and suicide) and \"GO GO\", which became much sought-after fashion items of the year. Michael was also seen in luminous gloves, which he later bemoaned as the clip of him always picked out by advertisers whenever \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\" went on to a compilation album. The video was filmed at the Carling Academy Brixton in London.\n\n    * In 2004, Japanese actor Yuji Oda made a cover of the song (\"Wake Me Up Go! Go!\") as a companion to his cover of \"Last Christmas\", both songs being the main soundtrack of the Japanese television drama he was starring in, Last Christmas.\n    * A cover of the song was recorded by Italian indie band Annie Hall.\n    * On Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway, Dec's team sung it as part of Ant Vs.

The song was George Michael's first solo single although he was still performing in Wham! at the time (the song is included on Wham!'s album Make it Big). The song features a saxophone riff, and has been covered by a number of artists since its first release. It was released as a single and became a huge commercial success on both sides of the Atlantic. It reached number one in nearly 25 countries, selling about six million copies worldwide.\n\nUnlike all the Wham! singles (except \"Wham Rap!\"), it was co-written by Andrew Ridgeley, the other member of the duo. The two had written it together as unknowns three years earlier, when Michael was working as a cinema usher in Watford, England. In a June 2006 interview on London radio station Magic 105.4, Michael said that he wrote it \"in his head\" during work and that he recalls coming up with the saxophone riff whilst boarding a number 32 bus on the way home. Originally the riff had words, but Michael declined to state them, saying that they were very poor lyrics.\n\nThe song went through at least two rounds of production. The first was during a trip Michael made to Muscle Shoals, Alabama, where he went to work with the legendary producer Jerry Wexler at the venerable Muscle Shoals Studio. Michael was unhappy with the version that was originally produced and decided to re-record and produce the song himself, this time coming up with the version that was finally released. The version Wexler produced did, however, see the light of day, but only later on, as a (4:41) B-side \"Special Version\" on 12\", released in England. A mid-tempo ballad with a soulful production standard and a remarkable saxophone solo (played by Steve Gregory), the single was issued in August 1984, entering the UK singles chart at number twelve. Within two weeks, it was at number one, ending a nine-week run at the top for \"Two Tribes\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood. It stayed at number one for three weeks, later going to the top of the charts in seventeen other countries, including the USA's Billboard Hot 100 in February 1985, although in the United States, it was credited as \"Wham! featuring George Michael\". It went on to become the 5th best-selling single of 1984 in the UK, being outsold only by the two Frankie Goes to Hollywood tracks \"Two Tribes\" and \"Relax\", Stevie Wonder with \"I Just Called to Say I Love You\", and Band Aid with \"Do They Know It's Christmas\".\n\nIn a 2006 poll for a programme Britain's Favourite Break-up Songs, \"Careless Whisper\" was voted sixth.\n\nThe music video shows the guilt felt by a man over an affair, and his acknowledgement that his partner was always going to find out. It was taped on location in Miami during June 1984 and features such locales as Coconut Grove and Watson Island. However, it does not give credit to the young women who also starred in the video.\n\n\"Careless Whisper\" was generally the closing act for concerts on the 25 Live tour, and less often in the Faith Tour concerts, usually performed live in many concerts tours like the Cover To Cover Tour and the Rock In Rio Tour. George Michael would often perform \"Careless Whisper\" with an extended version of the ending, which is apparently his preferred version.\n\nRecorded\n\n    * A hi-NRG/eurodance cover of the song by Sarah Washington was released through Almighty Records in 1993.\n    * A cover version of \"Careless Whisper\" by Tamia appears on her debut self-titled album, Tamia. A second recording by Tamia appeared on the soundtrack album to the 1998 movie A Night at the Roxbury.\n    * Israeli singer David D'Or covered the song in a January 2005 clubby, English electronic house vinyl 12\" single on the 3 Lanka and Hed Arzi labels, produced and mixed by DJ Amiad, with remixes by Future Funk and Michi Lange. The track attracted international interest.\n    * A version by Willy Mason appears on the 2007 compilation album, The Saturday Sessions: The Dermot O'Leary Show.\n    * Gossip covered the song in 2007 for the album Radio 1 Established 1967, a collection of covers recorded for the 40th year anniversary of BBC Radio 1.\n    * Quebec City acoustic cover band The Lost Fingers recorded a cover of the song for their 2008 album Lost In The 80s.\n    * Irish singer Edward J. Valentine released a version that reached number 47 for 1 week in the Irish music charts in 2008. Mike Mulvihill of \"The Power Hour\" hailed it as \"a song that defines this generation\" and that this cover was \"unrivalled\". \n    * American crunk pop band 3OH!3 covered this song with Alex Gaskarth of All Time Low and Juliet Simms of Automatic Loveletter.\n    * Seether covered the song in 2009. It was released as a single on February 9, 2009. Their version has reached #63 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and the top five on Mainstream and Modern Rock charts and the combined Rock Songs chart. In his review for Billboard, Bram Teitelman said, \"the song is a mostly faithful take on the original, with guitars subbing for the saxophone intro before greeting a Staind-meets-Nickelback grunge dynamic.

(Enjoy What You Do)\" Fantastic (C) 1983 Innervision Records."}, "description": "Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do) was a song by British pop duo Wham!, released in 1983 on Innervision Records. It was written by George Michael, one half of the duo.\n\nThe song, which had been tentatively released in 1982 when Wham! were unknowns and failed to make any impact, was re-issued in January 1983 after the duo had achieved their breakthrough with \"Young Guns (Go For It!)\".\n\nAlthough rap was still an underground and almost exclusively American phenomenon in the early 1980s, the title of the song didn't lie - George rapped a number of verses about the joys of living every day to the fullest, which meant that being gainfully employed was not an option, and 'having fun with the boys down the (welfare) line'. The chorus asked the question \"Do you enjoy what you do?\", which brought about the bracketed section of the title. The video depicted George and Andrew Ridgeley in their leather jackets, combining their moody image with a bright, effervescent choreography.\n\nWham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do) - the full version of which was almost seven minutes long - reached #8 in the UK singles chart, the second of four hits from Wham!'s debut album Fantastic. The duo would go on to enjoy four UK #1 hits before splitting at their height in 1986. On the flip side of their farewell single The Edge of Heaven was an updated version of the song, entitled Wham!

(often written WHAM!) was a pop band formed in 1981 from Bushey, England. They were briefly known in the United States as Wham! UK due to a naming conflict with another band.\n\nGeorge Michael and Andrew Ridgeley met at Bushey Meads School in Watford, England. At first, they performed in a short-lived rock and roll band called The Executive. They then changed their name and signed with Innervision Records. Soon after a legal victory over Innervision, the duo was signed to CBS, Columbia Records in the United States and Canada and Epic Records for the rest of the world.\n\nFurther information: Artist development deal \nMichael took on the majority of roles and responsibilities within the band\u2014 composer, singer, producer, and occasional instrumentalist\u2014 but the contribution of Ridgeley as the group's image specialist and spokesman was crucial to the band's initial success. Ridgeley convinced a reluctant George that Wham! needed to change their image and sound frequently, from the leather-clad moody singers of \"Bad Boys\" and \"Young Guns (Go For It!)\" to the more fashionable pop superstars of \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go.\"\n\nStill teenagers, they promoted themselves as hedonistic youngsters, proud to live a carefree life without work or commitment. This was reflected in their earliest singles. Such works as \"Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do?)\" have been seen as sarcasm advocating the other point of view.\n\nThe first record to be released by the band was \"Wham Rap!\". It was a double-A side with a Social Mix and Anti-social Mix. The record was banned for general release in the UK due to the profanity in the Anti-social Mix. In October 1982, their song \"Young Guns (Go For It!)\" was issued. The song was an appeal from one youthful lad to his friend to not throw his life away so early on marriage. It stalled outside the UK Top 40 but then Wham! got lucky when Top Of The Pops scheduled them. An important weekly BBC chart show on television, it had to look outside the Top 40 to fill a gap created by an act which had pulled out of recording. Nearest to the 40 mark and still climbing, Wham! was summoned, and a phenomenon immediately began.\n\nThe impact of Wham! on the public, especially teenage girls, was felt from the moment they finished their debut performance of \"Young Guns (Go For It!)\" on Top Of The Pops. Michael's appearance may have helped. He wore espadrilles, a suede jacket slit open, and rolled-up denim jeans. Ridgeley stood behind him, flanked by backing dancers D.C. Lee and Shirlie Holliman.\n\nThe performance was as much one of acting as it was of singing, with Michael playing the part of the pleading goodtime lad, and Ridgeley the guy who had been drawn into commitment. Afterwards, the song shot into the Top 40 at #24 and peaked at #3 in December. The following year (1983), D.C. Lee began her work with Paul Weller of The Style Council, and was replaced by Pepsi DeMacque. Holliman and DeMacque would later record music as Pepsi and Shirlie.\n\nWham! followed up \"Young Guns (Go For It!)\" with the reissue \"Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)\", a song about the joys of a leisurely life (the full version of which clocked in at almost seven minutes long); \"Bad Boys\", about a strained relationship between a rebellious teenage lad and his worried parents; and \"Club Tropicana\", a satire of the Club 18-30 scene. Each song came with a memorable music video.\n\nBy the end of 1983, Wham! was rivaling Duran Duran and Culture Club as Britain's biggest pop act. Notoriety and column inches were duly achieved with their antics of placing a shuttlecock down their shorts, and their first album Fantastic reached #1.\n\nAround this time, Ridgeley become conscious of legal problems with their initial contract at Innervision. He mounted a legal challenge against the record company and its founder Mark Dean, who had initially signed them to the label, and George publicly stated they were financially mistreated [citation needed]. While the legal battle raged (perhaps to raise much-needed funds for the fight), Innervision released a medley of non-single album tracks from Fantastic, entitled Club Fantastic Megamix. Wham! publicly denounced the move, and urged fans not to buy it. After all the legal wrangling, Innervision admitted there were royalty discrepancies with Wham!'s contract, leading to the bankruptcy and dissolution of Innervision.\n\nDriven by Ridgeley, the duo changed their image, and Wham! returned in May 1984 with an updated, cutting-edge pop image quickly copied by other pop bands. Andrew changed the band's look from \"moody in leather jackets\" to smiles and fashionable clothing, with an aim to promote themselves more as sex symbols rather than spokespeople for a disaffected generation.\n\nFittingly enough, these changes propelled the next single (a pop standard) to the top of the charts around the world. Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go, a song Michael wrote from a note left to him in his hotel room one night by Ridgeley. The note was mistakenly written by Ridgeley as \"don't forget to wake me up up before you go go, George\". Since he accidentally wrote the word \"up\" twice, Ridgeley decided to compound the error and write \"go\" twice. It became their first UK #1 and rose to the top in the USA), capped by a memorable video of the duo, plus the ubiquitous Pepsi and Shirlie, wearing Katharine Hamnett T-shirts with the slogans CHOOSE LIFE and GO GO.\n\nThese t-shirts became essential fashion items as Hamnett wrote herself into the pop culture lexicon, having simultaneously designed the FRANKIE SAY t-shirts for Frankie Goes to Hollywood.\n\nAlthough some critics felt that Wham! represented bubblegum pop[citation needed], many were starting to appreciate Michael's proven ability as a songwriter and capable vocalist. (The following year, he would win the Ivor Novello Award for songwriting.) However, at the same time they bemoaned the status of Ridgeley, who had started to \"play\" a guitar during live shows (never on any recordings) but whose overall contribution was deemed to be lightweight[citation needed].\n\nWith some bizarre contradiction, the next single \"Careless Whisper\" was issued as a George Michael solo piece, yet unlike any Wham! single since \"Wham Rap!,\" it was co-written by Ridgeley. The song quickly reached #1. In the autumn of 1984, Wham! came back as a duo with \"Freedom\", another chart-topper. In November, they released their second album, Make It Big, which coasted to #1 on the album charts. The band set off on another arena tour at the end of '84, and George told Smash Hits magazine at the time that he had written a song called \"Stephen.\" The song had been composed for a friend who was struggling to cope with bereavment. While this song is still unreleased, those that were at the recording sessions decsribe it as a heartfelt story of the loss of a loved one[citation needed].\n\nGeorge contributed to the Band Aid project, with Michael providing vocals as the song usurped their own Christmas release, \"Last Christmas\"/\"Everything She Wants\", the former of which featured a video set in a ski resort.\n\nThe single became the highest-selling single ever to peak at #2 in the UK charts. As such, Wham! donated all their royalties to the Ethiopian famine appeal to coincide with the fundraising intentions of Band Aid, the song which beat them to the top spot. Band Aid's success meant that Michael had been at #1 within three different entities in 1984\u2014as a solo artist, half of a duo, and part of a charity ensemble.\n\nMichael desired to create music targeted to a more sophisticated audience than the duo's primarily teenage fanbase. Therefore, Michael and Ridgeley announced the breakup of Wham! in the spring of 1986, destined to take place after a farewell single and album, along with a historic grand finale concert at Wembley Stadium on June 28, 1986, called The Final. British pop group Five Star declined George's invitation to be the supporting act, saying they needed to concentrate on their own career at the time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Wham%21\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The main riff came to David Gilmour while playing his acoustic guitar in Abbey Road Studios. Gilmour then demonstrated the riff to Waters, who was impressed. They collaborated to complete the song, as Waters had already written some lyrics. In 2004, the song was ranked #316 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nIn the original album version, the song segues from \"Have a Cigar\" as if a radio had been tuned away from one station, through several others (including a radio play and one playing Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony), and finally to a new station where \"Wish You Were Here\" is beginning. Gilmour performed the intro on a twelve-string guitar, processed to sound like it was playing through an old transistor radio, and then overdubbed a fuller-sounding acoustic guitar solo. This passage was mixed to sound as though the guitarist was sitting in a room, playing along with the radio; it also contains a whine that slowly changes pitch\u2014emulating the heterodyne between two drifting AM radio signals.\n\nThe intro riff is repeated several times and reprised when Gilmour plays further solos with scat singing accompaniment. At the end of the recorded song, the final solo crossfades with wind sound effects (reminiscent of \"One of These Days\" from the 1971 album Meddle), and finally segues into the second section of the multi-part suite \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\".\n\nNotable cover versions include:\n\nMatti Paalanen: Wish You Were Here piano version on Spotify\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/_/Wish+You+Were+Here\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The final solo is widely revered by fans worldwide as one of Gilmour's best, and is the archetypal rock guitar solo and it is frequently within the top of all guitar solo polls, such as a poll by listeners of digital radio station Planet Rock, in which it was named the best solo of all time.

It is an instrumental that deals with the pressures of travel (which Rick Wright said would often bring fear of death), and is a VCS3 synthesizer-led piece. When the band performed this song in concert, at the end of it, a model aeroplane would fly from one end of the arena to the other, appearing to crash in a brilliant explosion. The same effect was used in the A Momentary Lapse of Reason tours with a flying bed, and was an inspiration for the fictional band Disaster Area from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, whose stage act involves a spaceship crashing into the sun. During recording sessions, as well as in live appearances, this song was sometimes referred to as \"the travel sequence.\"\n\nThis piece was created by feeding an 8 note sequence of semiquavers into the EMS VCS3 and speeding it up, with an added white noise generator creating the hi-hat sound. The band then added backwards guitar parts, created by dragging a microphone stand down the fretboard, reverse the tape, and panned left to right. There are also some other synthesizer parts, made to sound like some type of vehicle passing, giving a Doppler effect. The 8 note sequence (E, G, A, G on octave below Middle C, and D, middle C, D, E on Middle C octave) is played at a tempo of 166, and modulates upwards occasionally. Near the end, the explosion of the presumed aircraft is heard which gradually fades, segueing into the chiming clocks introduction of the following track \"Time\".\n\nWhen the Dark Side of the Moon was performed in 1972 (before the album was released), it went under the title \"The Travel Sequence\" and was, instead of a complex electronic instrumental, a more simple guitar jam, without the use of synthesizers and other electronic instruments. A short clip of this is played on the DVD \"Classic Albums: The Making of Dark Side of the Moon\" and can also be heard on all performances of Pink Floyd playing the album live in that year. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/_/On+the+Run\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was sung by Roger Waters, with harmonies by David Gilmour. After Waters left, Gilmour sang the lead when performing live.\n\nThe song is often mistakenly labelled \"Dark Side of the Moon\" alongside \"Brain Damage\" because the two run together and are commonly played together on the radio, giving the impression that they are one song. The incorrect title is derived from a recurring lyric in \"Brain Damage\" and the title of the album.\n\nThe song serves as a climax to the album and features a loud, repetitive melody which builds and then ends with a very quiet outro. When the main instrumentation ends at approximately 1:30, the sound of a heartbeat from the first track, \"Speak to Me\", appears and gradually fades to silence.\n\nThe song consists of a repeating four chord pattern: D Major, D over C in the bass (a compound chord usually notated as \"D/C\".), B-flat Major Seventh (\"B\u266dmaj7\" -- this chord can be heard as a D minor over a B\u266d bass, or \"Dm/B\u266d\", though that is not a proper chord name), and A7 (with a suspended fourth resolving to the major third -- notated as A7sus4 to A7). However, the arrangement adds variety. Guitarist David Gilmour recorded two tracks of rhythm guitar, playing arpeggios, one in open position, and one much higher, around the tenth fret. The lower-pitched guitar part includes the open G and E strings during the B\u266dmaj7, resulting in an added sixth and a dissonant augmented fourth. However, these notes become consonant as they sustain through to the next chord, A7. The quartet of female background singers vary their parts, rising in volume, and echoing some of Waters' lyrics, as the piece builds in intensity. On the last repetition of the chord progression, the B\u266dmaj7 leads directly to a climax on D major, resulting in a \"brightening\" effect (known as the Picardy third), as the aforementioned implication of D minor in the B\u266dmaj7 chord shifts to the major.\n\nAt the end of \"Eclipse\", after or during the spoken words of 'There is no dark side...', a small chamber string orchestra can be heard playing a light tune which sounds like it's heard from a small radio in another room. To be able to hear this, one must listen especially carefully with headphones and the volume at maximum level. On some copies of the album, an orchestral version of The Beatles' song \"Ticket to Ride\" can be heard playing in the background during the fade but only on one stereo channel. Fans have tried to find a meaning behind this, but it was likely just an artefact of the recording process, such as an improperly erased tape. The recording has been identified by some as having come from George Martin's orchestral adaptation of the Beatles album Help!. Coincidentally, Paul McCartney and Wings were recording in the same studio.\n\nMcCartney was one of the people interviewed by Roger Waters as part of the latter's efforts to develop dialogue to accompany certain songs on the album. The McCartney interview was not used, but Abbey Road Studios doorman Gerry O'Driscoll's was.

It is approximately 3 minutes, 25 seconds in length. The song used advanced effects for the time both in the keyboard and the guitar. The VCS 3 synthesizer was fed through a long tape loop to create the rising and falling keyboard solo. David Gilmour used two guitars with the UniVibe guitar effect to create the harmonizing guitar solo for the rest of the song. \"Any Colour You Like\" is also known (and is even listed on the \"Dark Side\" guitar tablature book) as \"Breathe (Second Reprise)\" because the song shares the same beat (albeit somewhat funkier and uptempo) as the album's song \"Breathe.\" It has also nearly the same chord sequence just transposed a whole step lower from E minor to D minor.\n\nWhile the song is instrumental, it has been speculated that the song ties to The Dark Side of the Moon concept by concerning the lack of choice one has in the human society, while being alluded to thinking that he does. It is also speculated that the song is about the fear of making choices. The origin of the title is unclear. One possible origin of the title comes from an answer frequently given by a studio technician to questions put to him: \"You can have it any colour you like\", which was a reference to Henry Ford's apocryphal description of the Model T: \"You can have it any color you like, as long as it's black.\"\n\nRoger Waters may have settled this question, in an interview with musicologist and author Phil Rose, for Rose's collection of analytical essays, Which One's Pink?:\n\n\"In Cambridge where I lived, people would come from London in a van - a truck - open the back and stand on the tailboard of the truck, and the truck's full of stuff that they're trying to sell. And they have a very quick and slick patter, and they're selling things like crockery, china, sets of knives and forks. All kinds of different things, and they sell it very cheap with a patter. They tell you what it is, and they say 'It's ten plates, lady, and it's this, that, and the other, and eight cups and saucers, and for the lot I'm asking NOT ten pounds, NOT five pounds, NOT three pounds . . . fifty bob to you!', and they get rid of this stuff like this. If they had sets of china, and they were all the same colour, they would say, 'You can 'ave 'em, ten bob to you, love. Any colour you like, they're all blue.' And that was just part of that patter. So, metaphorically, 'Any Colour You Like' is interesting, in that sense, because it denotes offering a choice where there is none. And it's also interesting that in the phrase, 'Any colour you like, they're all blue', I don't know why, but in my mind it's always 'they're all blue', which, if you think about it, relates very much to the light and dark, sun and moon, good and evil. You make your choice but it's always blue.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/_/Any+Colour+You+Like\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released on The Wall album in 1979.\n\nThe song is approximately 1 minute, 52 seconds in length, beginning with 24 seconds of a helicopter approaching followed by shouting from the schoolmaster. When Kate Bush tried to add a similar helicopter to the fadeout of her single \"Experiment IV\", her recording engineers were unable to duplicate the overwhelming sound, so she asked Roger Waters for the original tape, and he obliged as long as it was mentioned in the credits. After that the sound effects abruptly cut out for the lyrical portion. Throughout the most of the song, the lead instrument is the bass guitar with an added delay effect and during the bridge to \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part II\", there are intense drums and backing vocals. Due to the smooth transition from this song to Another Brick In The Wall Pt. II, many people think this song is part of Another Brick.\n\nOn the album, \"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\" segues into \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part II\" with a loud, high-pitched scream by Roger Waters (this sound is later reprised on Run Like Hell). Because of this segue, many radio stations play one right after the other.\n\nIn the film based on the album, the sound at the beginning of the song is depicted as coming from a train entering a large tunnel, rather than a helicopter heard on the album. According to Gerald Scarfe, there was supposed to be a puppet of the teacher at the end of the tunnel in the film. Alan Parker made shots of it, but it didn't work out, so they used Alex McAvoy, who played the teacher, to do the scene instead. Before the cut in the middle for the Schoolmaster to mock Pink, somewhat quiet hysterical laughter is heard, extremely similar to the Schoolmaster's voice. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/_/The+Happiest+Days+of+Our+Lives\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Ann Wilson, lead singer of Heart, recorded a cover version of this song for her 2007 solo release Hope & Glory with her sister, Nancy Wilson.\n\nThe piece is fairly quiet in terms of dynamics, although the tone does change several times throughout. It is 2 minutes, 48 seconds in length. In the introduction section, there is an innocent childish voice stating, \"Look, mummy, there's an aeroplane up in the sky!\". This particular section is calm and tranquil initially, but quickly grows more sinister in tone. Shortly after the tone change, the main lyrical section commences.

Song #22 (Disk 2) \"Run Like Hell\" Create playlist to entire CD. Order number in title. Sorry, it's just that picture. Lyrics:..."}, "description": "\"Run Like Hell\" is a song on the Pink Floyd album The Wall. It is preceded by \"In the Flesh\" and is followed by \"Waiting for the Worms\". The song is from the point of view of anti-hero Pink during a hallucination, in which he becomes a fascist dictator and turns a concert audience into an angry mob. He sends the mob out to raid nearby neighborhoods that are full of minorities.\n\nThe music was written by David Gilmour (one of the three songs on The Wall for which Gilmour wrote music), while the lyrics were by Roger Waters alone. On the record, Waters provided the vocals (except for \"Run, Run\", in which Gilmour is lead singer). The song features the only keyboard solo on The Wall (although on live performances, \"Young Lust\" and \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part II\" would also feature keyboard solos); after the last line of lyrics, a synthesizer apparently takes over Waters' singing. Also in the song are the sound of the mob's maniacal laughter, running footsteps, car tires skidding and a loud scream.\n\nThis song was originally much longer, however it had to be cut because of the time limitations on the original vinyl record format. Although the lyrics \"Run like hell\" appear several times in the liner notes, they are never actually heard in the song. Near the end, the same piercing shriek (made by Waters) can be heard, almost identical to that heard during \"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\" when seguing into \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part II\".\n\nThe original single version and promo EP both contain a clean guitar intro, without the live crowd effects.\n\nFollowing Waters' departure from Pink Floyd, the song became a regular number in the band's concerts, usually ending the show and going over nine minutes long. One live version was used as the B-side to \"On the Turning Away\". It can be heard, for example, closing the live album Delicate Sound of Thunder. Gilmour generally played an extended guitar introduction, sharing vocals with touring bassist Guy Pratt, with Pratt singing Waters' lines. In the 1994 tour, Pratt sometimes sang the name of the city where they were playing instead of the word mother in the line \"...they're going to send you back to mother in a cardboard box...\" \u2013 in the P\u2022U\u2022L\u2022S\u2022E video (live at Earls Court, 1994), he clearly sings London. In fact, in his book My Bass and Other Animals, Pratt states that for the final leg of the tour, he replaced the word mother with the name of whichever town they were playing in.\n\nIn addition to doing the song with Pink Floyd, Gilmour has also performed it himself on his solo tour in 1984, in support of his About Face album. In Waters' absence, Gilmour would trade lines with bassist Mickey Feat. He also performed the song solo at the Colombian Volcano benefit concert in 1986, trading lines with house-band keyboardist John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/_/Run+Like+Hell\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Its lyrics speak of the things one may have gained and lost in life and also an autobiographical flair to it for Gilmour. Douglas Adams, a friend of Gilmour's, chose the album title from one of the lyrics in this song, the last song recorded for the album in what David Gilmour described as a \"flash of inspiration\".\n\nPink Floyd manager, Steve O'Rourke, who lobbied to be included on one of the group's albums, appears at the end with Gilmour's stepson, Charlie, who hangs up a telephone on O'Rourke.\n\nThe beginning of \"High Hopes\" is reminiscent of another of his songs, \"Fat Old Sun\", from the Pink Floyd album Atom Heart Mother. Bells chime at the beginning of both pieces, for example.\n\nThe bird sounds and fly buzzing can also be traced back to \"Grantchester Meadows\", a song from the 1969 Pink Floyd album, Ummagumma, written by Roger Waters.\n\nThis being the very last song that Pink Floyd has written to date (and its placement at the end of their last album of new material to date) lends itself to the interpretation that the song narrates the story of the band's career, from their beginnings to their grandiose success (with The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall) to their breakup to their carrying on. The final line (\"The endless river, forever and ever\") ties into one of the band's first hits, \"See Emily Play\" (\"Float on a river, forever and ever\").\n\n\"High Hopes\" was included in the 2001 compilation, Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd with a shortened slide-guitar solo.

The song centres around an aspiring musician who is getting signed by a seedy executive to the music industry, \"The Machine\".[citation needed] The voice predicts all the boy's seemingly rebellious ideas (\"You bought a guitar to punish your ma, you didn't like school, and you know you're nobody's fool\"). The boy's illusions of personal identity are further crushed with lines such as, \"What did you dream, it's alright we told you what to dream\". The lyrics also allude to the band's disillusionment with the music industry as a money-making machine rather than a forum of artistic expression. On the original LP, the song segued from the first 5 parts of the suite \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" and closed the first side. On the CD pressings, especially the 1997 and 2000 remastered issues, it segues (although very faintly) to \"Have a Cigar\". This segueing is a few seconds longer on the US version than the UK version. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/_/Welcome+to+the+Machine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Pink Floyd is one of rock's most successful and influential acts, having sold over 200 million albums worldwide and with 74.5 million certified units in the United States, making them one of the best-selling artists of all time. Currently the band consists of David Gilmour (vocals, guitar) and Nick Mason (drums).\n\nThe band's classic lineup was Roger Waters (vocals, bass), David Gilmour (vocals, guitar), Rick Wright (organ, keyboards, vocals) and Nick Mason (drums). Gilmour was brought into the band in 1968 to replace the band's founder, singer, guitarist and songwriter Syd Barrett, who had become increasingly erratic and departed from the band a few months after Gilmour's addition. The band became known for their advancements in the genres of psychedelic rock and progressive rock music, philosophical lyrics, avant-garde compositions, sonic experimentation, innovative cover art and elaborate live shows. \n\nPink Floyd enjoyed modest success in the late-1960s as a psychedelic band led by Syd Barrett. Barrett\u2019s increasingly erratic behavior eventually caused his colleagues to replace him after The Piper at the Gates Of Dawn with guitarist David Gilmour. The band went on to record several elaborate concept albums; achieving worldwide success with 1973\u2019s The Dark Side of the Moon (The second best-selling album of all time), 1975\u2019s Wish You Were Here, 1977\u2019s Animals, and 1979\u2019s The Wall, among the best-selling, most critically acclaimed, and enduringly popular albums in rock music history. In 1985, singer and bassist Roger Waters declared Pink Floyd defunct. However, the remaining members continued recording and touring under the name, eventually reaching a settlement with Waters giving them rights to the name and most of the songs.\n\nPink Floyd evolved from an earlier band, formed in 1964, which was at various times called Sigma 6, The Meggadeaths, The Screaming Abdabs, and The Abdabs. When this band split up, some members \u2014 guitarists Bob Klose and Roger Waters, drummer Nick Mason, and wind instrument player Rick Wright \u2014 formed a new band called Tea Set, and were joined shortly thereafter by guitarist Syd Barrett, who became the band\u2019s primary vocalist as well. When Tea Set found themselves on the same bill as another band with the same name, Barrett came up with an alternative name on the spur of the moment, choosing The Pink Floyd Sound (after two blues musicians, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council). For a time after this they oscillated between \u2018Tea Set\u2019 and \u2018The Pink Floyd Sound\u2019, with the latter name eventually winning out. The word Sound was dropped fairly quickly, but the definite article was still used occasionally for several years afterward, up to about the time of the More soundtrack. In the early days, the band covered rhythm and blues staples such as \u201cLouie, Louie\u201d, but gained notoriety for psychedelic interpretations, with extended improvised sections and \u2018spaced out\u2019 solos.\n\nThe heavily jazz-oriented Klose left the band to become a photographer shortly before Pink Floyd started recording, leaving an otherwise stable lineup with Barrett on lead guitar, Waters on bass guitar, Mason on drums and Wright switching to keyboards. Barrett started writing his own songs, influenced by American and British psychedelic rock with his own brand of whimsical humor. Pink Floyd became a favorite in the underground movement, playing at such prominent venues as the UFO club, the Marquee Club and the Roundhouse. As their popularity increased, the band members formed Blackhill Enterprises in October 1966, a six-way business partnership with their managers, Peter Jenner and Andrew King, issuing the singles \"Arnold Layne\" in March 1967 and \u201cSee Emily Play\u201d in June 1967. \u201cArnold Layne\u201d reached number 20 in the UK Singles Chart, and \u201cSee Emily Play\u201d reached number 6, granting the band its first TV appearance on Top of the Pops in July 1967.\n\nReleased in August 1967, the band\u2019s debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, is today considered to be a prime example of British psychedelic music, and was generally well-received by critics at the time, and it is now viewed as one of the better debut albums by many critics. The album\u2019s tracks, predominantly written by Barrett, showcase poetic lyrics and an eclectic mixture of music, from the avant-garde free-form piece \"Interstellar Overdrive\" to whimsical songs such as \"The Scarecrow\", inspired by the Fenlands, a rural region north of Cambridge (Barrett, Gilmour and Waters\u2019s home town). Lyrics were entirely surreal and often referred to folklore, such as \"The Gnome\". The music reflected newer technologies in electronics through its prominent use of stereo panning and electric keyboards. The album was a hit in the UK where it peaked at #6, but did not get much attention in North America, reaching #131 in the U.S. During this period, the band toured with The Jimi Hendrix Experience, which helped to increase its popularity.\n\nAs the band became more and more popular, the stresses of life on the road and a significant intake of psychedelic drugs took their toll on Barrett, whose mental health had been deteriorating for several months. While Barrett\u2019s behavior has often been attributed to his drug use, there are many who think that a pre-existing condition, possibly schizophrenia, was equally to blame. In January 1968, guitarist David Gilmour joined the band to carry out Syd\u2019s playing and singing duties. With Barrett\u2019s behavior becoming less and less predictable, and his almost constant use of LSD, he became very unstable, often staring into space while the rest of the band performed. During some performances, he would simply strum one chord for the duration of a concert, or simply begin detuning his guitar. The band\u2019s live shows became increasingly ramshackle until, eventually, the other band members simply stopped taking him to the concerts. It was originally hoped that Syd would write for the band with Gilmour performing live, similar to how the Beach Boys had done with Brian Wilson. However, due to Barrett\u2019s increasingly difficult compositions, such as \"Have You Got It Yet?\u201d, which changed melodies and chord progression with every take, eventually made the rest of the band give up on this arrangement. Once Barrett\u2019s departure was formalized in April 1968, producers Jenner and King decided to remain with him, and the six-way Blackhill partnership was dissolved. The band adopted Steve O\u2019Rourke as manager, and he remained with Pink Floyd until his death in 2003.\n\nMusically, this period was one of experimentation for the band. Gilmour, Waters and Wright each contributed material that had its own voice and sound, giving this material less consistency than the Barrett-dominated early years or the more polished, collaborative sound of later years. Waters mostly wrote low-key, jazzy melodies with dominant bass lines and complex, symbolic lyrics, Gilmour focused on guitar-driven blues jams, and Wright preferred melodic psychedelic keyboard-heavy numbers. Unlike Waters, Gilmour and Wright preferred tracks that had simple lyrics or that were purely instrumental. Some of the band\u2019s most experimental music is from this period, such as \"A Saucerful of Secrets\", consisting largely of feedback and atonal screeches and loops, \u201cSeveral Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving with a Pict\u201d, which is a series of sped-up voice samples resembling rodents chattering that reaches its climax in an incomprehensible Scottish dialect monologue, and \u201cCareful with That Axe, Eugene\u201d (performed under different names during this period), a very Waters-driven song with a bass and keyboard-heavy jam culminating in crashing drums and Waters\u2019s primal screams.\n\nWhilst Barrett had written the bulk of the first album, only one Barrett composition, the Piper outtake \u201cJugband Blues\u201d, appeared on the second Floyd album. A Saucerful of Secrets was released in June 1968, reaching #9 in the UK and becoming the only Pink Floyd album not to chart in the U.S. Somewhat uneven due to Barrett\u2019s departure, the album still contained much of his psychedelic sound combined with the more experimental music that would be fully showcased on Ummagumma. Hints of the epic, lengthy songs to come are in its centerpiece, the 12-minute title track, but the album was poorly received by critics at the time, although critics today tend to be kinder to the album in the context of their body of work. Future Floyd albums would expand upon the idea of long, sprawling compositions, offering more focused songwriting with each subsequent release.\n\nPink Floyd were then recruited by director Barbet Schroeder to produce a soundtrack for his film, More, which premiered in May 1969. The music was released as a Floyd album in its own right, Music From the Film More, in July 1969; the album achieved another #9 finish in the UK, and peaked at #153 in the U.S. The band would use this and future soundtrack recording sessions to produce work that may not have fit into the idea of what would appear on a proper Pink Floyd LP; many of the tracks on More (as fans usually call it) were acoustic folk songs, although critics tend to find the collection of the film\u2019s music patchy and uneven. Two of these songs, \u201cGreen Is the Colour\u201d and \u201cCymbaline\u201d, became fixtures in the band\u2019s live sets for a time, as can be heard in the many available bootleg recordings from this period. The latter was also the first Pink Floyd song to deal with Roger Waters\u2019s cynical attitude toward the music industry explicitly. The rest of the album consisted of incidental music with a few heavier rock songs thrown in, such as \u201cThe Nile Song\u201d.\n\nThe next record, the double album Ummagumma, was a mix of live recordings and unchecked studio experimentation by the band members, with each member recording half a side of a vinyl record as a solo project (Mason\u2019s first wife makes an uncredited contribution as a flautist). Though the album was realized as solo outings and a live set, it was originally intended as a purely avant-garde mixture of sounds from \u201cfound\u201d instruments. The subsequent difficulties in recording and lack of group organization led to the shelving of the project. The title is slang for sexual procreation, and reflects the attitude of the band at the time, as frustrations in the studio followed them throughout these sessions. Wildly experimental on the studio disc (except for Waters\u2019s pure folk \u201cGrantchester Meadows\u201d), with atonal and jarring piano pieces (\u201cSysyphus\u201d), meandering folk guitar (\u201cThe Narrow Way\u201d) and large percussion solos, the live disc featured excellent performances of some of their most popular psychedelic-era compositions and caused critics to receive the album more positively than the previous two albums. With fans, the album was Pink Floyd\u2019s most popular release yet, hitting UK #5 and making the U.S. charts at #74.\n\n1970\u2019s Atom Heart Mother, the band\u2019s first recording with an orchestra, was a collaboration with avant-garde composer Ron Geesin. One side of the album consisted of the title piece, a 23-minute long rock-orchestral suite. The second side featured one song from each of the band\u2019s then-current vocalists (Roger Waters\u2019s folk-rock \u201cIf\u201d, David Gilmour\u2019s bluesy \u201cFat Old Sun\u201d and Rick Wright\u2019s psychedelic \u201cSummer \u201868\u201d). Another lengthy piece, \u201cAlan\u2019s Psychedelic Breakfast\u201d, was a sound collage of a man cooking and eating breakfast and his thoughts on the matter, linked with instrumentals. The use of incidental sound effects and voice samples would thereafter be an important part of the band\u2019s sound. While Atom Heart Mother was considered a huge step back for the band at the time and is still considered one of its most inaccessible albums, it had the best chart performance for the band so far, reaching #1 in the UK and #55 in the U.S., although it has since been described by Gilmour as \"a load of rubbish\" and Waters as suitable for \"throwing in the dustbin and never [being] listened to by anyone ever again.\" The album was another transitional piece for the group, hinting at future musical territory such as \u201cEchoes\u201d in its ambitious title track. The popularity of the album allowed Pink Floyd to embark on its first full U.S. tour. Before releasing its next original album, the band released a compilation album, Relics, which contained several early singles and B-sides, along with one original song (Waters\u2019s jazzy \u201cBiding My Time\u201d).\n\nThis is the period in which the Floyd shed their association with the \u201cpsychedelic\u201d scene (and its association with Barrett) and became a distinctive band that are difficult to classify. The divergent styles of Gilmour, Waters and Wright (Mason\u2019s writing contributions to the group were minimal) were merged into a unique sound. This era contains what many consider to be two of the band\u2019s masterpiece albums, The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here. The sound became polished and collaborative, with the philosophic lyrics and distinctive bass lines of Waters combining with the unique blues guitar style of Gilmour and Wright\u2019s light keyboard melodies. Gilmour was the dominant vocalist throughout this period, and female choirs and Dick Parry\u2019s saxophone contributions in the studio became a notable part of the band\u2019s style. The sometimes atonal and harsh sound exhibited in the band\u2019s earlier years gave way to a very smooth, mellow and soothing sound, and the band\u2019s epic, lengthy compositions reached their zenith with \u201cEchoes\u201d from Meddle (although \u201cShine On You Crazy Diamond\u201d exceeded it in total length, it was split in two pieces as the opening and closing of Wish You Were Here). This period was not only the beginning but the end of the truly collaborative era of the band; after 1975 Waters\u2019s influence became more dominant musically as well as lyrically. Wright\u2019s last credited composition and last lead vocal on a studio album until 1994\u2019s The Division Bell were in this period, and Gilmour\u2019s writing credits sharply declined in frequency until Waters left the band in 1985. The last ties with Barrett were severed in musical, as well as literal, fashion with Wish You Were Here, whose epic tracks \u201cShine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts I-V)\u201d/\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts VI-IX)\" were written both as a tribute and elegy to their friend.\n\nThe band\u2019s sound was considerably more focused on Meddle (1971), with the 23-minute epic \u201cEchoes\u201d taking up the second side of the LP. \u201cEchoes\u201d is a smooth progressive rock song with extended guitar and keyboard solos and a long segue in the middle consisting largely of synthesized whale song produced on guitar, along with samples of seagull cries, described by Waters as a \u201csonic poem\u201d. Meddle was considered by Nick Mason to be \u201cthe first real Pink Floyd album. It introduced the idea of a theme that can be returned to.\u201d The album had the sound and style of the succeeding breakthrough-era Pink Floyd albums but stripped away the orchestra that was prominent in Atom Heart Mother. Meddle also included the atmospheric \u201cOne of These Days\u201d, a concert favorite featuring Nick Mason\u2019s menacing one-line vocal (\u201cOne of these days, I\u2019m going to cut you into little pieces\u201d), distorted and bluesy slide guitar, and a melody that at one point segues into a throbbing synthetic pulse quoting the theme tune of the cult classic science fiction television show Doctor Who. The mellow feeling of the next three albums is very present on \u201cFearless\u201d, and this track displays a country influence, as does the prominent pedal steel guitar on \u201cA Pillow of Winds\u201d. The latter track is one of the Floyd\u2019s very few acoustic love songs. Waters\u2019s role as lead songwriter began to take form, with his jazzy \u201cSan Tropez\u201d brought to the band practically completed. Meddle was greeted both by critics and fans enthusiastically, and Pink Floyd were rewarded with a #3 album chart peak in the UK; it only reached #70 in U.S. charts, partly because Capitol Records had not provided it with enough publicity support. Today, Meddle remains one of their most well-regarded efforts.\n\nObscured by Clouds was released in 1972 as the soundtrack to the film La Vallee, another art house film by Barbet Schroeder. This was the band\u2019s first U.S. Top 50 album (where it hit #46), hitting at #6 in the UK. While Mason described the album years later as \u201csensational\u201d, it is less well-regarded by critics. The lyrics of \u201cFree Four\u201d, the first Pink Floyd song to achieve significant airplay in the U.S., introduced Waters\u2019s ruminations on his father\u2019s death in World War II which would figure in subsequent albums. Two other songs on the album, \u201cWots\u2026uh, the Deal\u201d and \u201cChildhood\u2019s End\u201d, also hint at themes used in later albums, the former focusing on loneliness and desperation which would come to full fruit in the Roger Waters-led era, and the latter hinting much at the next album, fixated on life, death and the passage of time. \u201cChildhood\u2019s End\u201d, inspired by the Arthur C. Clarke book of the same name, was also Gilmour\u2019s last lyrical contribution for 15 years. The album was, to an extent, stylistically different from the preceding Meddle, with the songs generally being shorter, often taking a somewhat pastoral approach compared to the atmospheric use of sound effects and keyboard on sections of Meddle, and sometimes even running into folk rock, blues rock and piano-driven soft rock (\u201cBurning Bridges\u201d, \u201cThe Gold It\u2019s in the\u2026\u201d and \u201cStay\u201d being the best respective examples for each).\n\nThe release of Pink Floyd\u2019s massively successful 1973 album, The Dark Side of the Moon, was a watershed moment in the band\u2019s popularity. Pink Floyd had stopped issuing singles after 1968\u2019s \u201cPoint Me At The Sky\u201d and was never a hit-single-driven group, but The Dark Side of the Moon featured a U.S. Top 20 single (\u201cMoney\u201d). The album became the band\u2019s first #1 on U.S. charts, a huge improvement over its previous recordings. The critically-acclaimed album stayed on the Billboard Top 200 for an unprecedented 741 weeks (including 591 consecutive weeks from 1976 to 1988), establishing a world record and making it one of the top-selling albums of all time. It also remained 301 weeks on UK charts, despite never rising higher than #2 there, and is highly praised by critics. Saxophone forms an important part of the album\u2019s sound, exposing the band\u2019s jazz influences, and female backing vocals play a key role in helping to diversify the album\u2019s texture. For example, straight rock songs such as \u201cMoney\u201d and \u201cTime\u201d are placed on either side of mellow pedal steel guitar sounds (reminiscent of Meddle) in \u201cBreathe\u201d and female vocal-laden song \u201cThe Great Gig in the Sky\u201d (with Clare Torry on lead vocal), while minimalist instrumental \u201cOn the Run\u201d is performed almost entirely on a single synthesizer. Incidental sound effects and snippets of interviews feature alongside the music, many of them taped in the studio. The album\u2019s lyrics and sound attempt to describe the different pressures that everyday life places upon human beings. This concept (conceived by Waters in a band meeting around Mason\u2019s kitchen table) proved a powerful catalyst for the band and together they drew up a list of themes, several of which would be revisited by Waters on later albums, such as \u201cUs and Them\u201c\u2018s musings on violence and the futility of war, and the themes of insanity and neurosis discussed in \u201cBrain Damage\u201d. The album\u2019s complicated and precise sound engineering by Alan Parsons set new standards for sound fidelity; this trait became a recognizable aspect of the band\u2019s sound and played a part in the lasting chart success of the album, as audiophiles constantly replaced their worn-out copies.\n\nSeeking to capitalize on its newfound fame, the band also released a compilation album, A Nice Pair, which was a gatefold repackaging of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn and A Saucerful of Secrets. It was also during this period that director Adrian Maben released the first Pink Floyd concert film, Live at Pompeii. The original theatrical cut featured footage of the band performing in 1971 at an amphitheater in Pompeii with no audience present (only the film crew and stage staff). Fortuitously, Maben also happened to capture some interviews and behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band during recording sessions for Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios, some of which were incorporated alongside other new footage between songs in later versions of Live at Pompeii.\n\nWish You Were Here, released in 1975, carries an abstract theme of absence: absence of any humanity within the music industry and, most poignantly, the absence of Syd Barrett. Well-known for its popular title track, the album includes the largely instrumental, nine-part song suite \u201cShine On You Crazy Diamond\u201d, a tribute to Barrett in which the lyrics deal explicitly with the aftermath of his breakdown. Many of the musical influences in the band\u2019s past were brought together \u2014 atmospheric keyboards, blues guitar pieces, extended saxophone solos (by Dick Parry), jazz fusion workouts and aggressive slide guitar \u2014 in the suite\u2019s different linked parts, culminating in a funeral dirge played with synthesized horn. The remaining tracks on the album, \u201cWelcome to the Machine\u201d and \u201cHave a Cigar\u201d, harshly criticize the music industry; the latter is sung by British folk singer Roy Harper. It was the first Pink Floyd album to reach #1 on both the UK and the U.S. charts, and critics praise it just as enthusiastically as Dark Side of the Moon. In a famous anecdote, a heavyset man with a completely shaved head and eyebrows wandered into the studio while the band was recording \u201cShine On You Crazy Diamond\u201d. The band could not recognize him for some time, when suddenly one of them realized it was Syd Barrett. He was greeted enthusiastically by the band but subsequently slipped away during the impromptu party for David Gilmour\u2019s wedding (which was, coincidentally, also on that day). It was the last time any of the other band members saw him. Gilmour recently confirmed this story, although he could not recall which song they were working on when Syd showed up. Barrett\u2019s eyebrow-shaving tendencies would later be revisited in the movie Pink Floyd: The Wall.\n\nDuring this era, Waters asserted more and more control over Pink Floyd\u2019s output. Wright\u2019s influence became largely inconsequential, and he was fired from the band during the recording of The Wall. Much of the music from this period is considered secondary to the lyrics, which explore Waters\u2019s feelings about his father\u2019s death in World War II and his increasingly cynical attitude towards political figures such as Margaret Thatcher and Mary Whitehouse. Although still finely nuanced, the music grew more guitar-based at the expense of keyboards and saxophone, both of which became (at best) part of the music\u2019s background texture along with the obligatory sound effects. A full orchestra (even larger than the brass ensemble from Atom Heart Mother) plays a significant role on The Wall and especially The Final Cut.\n\nBy January 1977, and the release of Animals (UK #2, U.S. #3), the band\u2019s music came under increasing criticism from some quarters in the new punk rock sphere as being too flabby and pretentious, having lost its way from the simplicity of early rock and roll. Animals was, however, considerably more basic-sounding than the previous albums, due to either the influence of the burgeoning punk-rock movement or the fact that the album was recorded at Pink Floyd\u2019s new (and somewhat incomplete) Britannia Row Studios. The album was also the first to not have a single songwriting credit for Rick Wright. Animals again contained lengthy songs tied to a theme, this time taken in part from George Orwell\u2019s Animal Farm, which used \u201cPigs\u201d, \u201cDogs\u201d and \u201cSheep\u201d as metaphors for members of contemporary society. Despite the prominence of guitar, keyboards and synthesizers still play an important role on Animals, but the saxophone and female vocal work that defined much of the previous two albums\u2019 sound is absent. The result is a more hard-rock effort overall, bookended by two parts of a quiet acoustic piece. Many critics did not respond well to the album, finding it \u201ctedious\u201d and \u201cbleak\u201d, although some celebrated it for almost those very reasons. For the cover artwork, a giant inflatable pig was commissioned to float between the chimney towers of London\u2019s Battersea Power Station. However, the wind made the pig balloon difficult to control, and in the end it was necessary to matte a photo of the pig balloon onto the album cover. The pig nevertheless became one of the enduring symbols of Pink Floyd, and inflatable pigs were a staple of the band\u2019s live shows from then on.\n\n1979\u2019s epic rock opera The Wall, conceived by Waters, dealt with the themes of loneliness and failed communication, which were expressed by the metaphor of a wall built between a rock artist and his audience. This album gave Pink Floyd renewed acclaim and another chart-topping single with \u201cAnother Brick in the Wall (Part 2)\u201d. The Wall also included the future concert staples \u201cComfortably Numb\u201d and \u201cRun Like Hell\u201d, with the former in particular becoming a cornerstone of album-oriented rock and classic-rock radio playlists as well as one of the group\u2019s best-known songs. The album was co-produced by Bob Ezrin, a friend of Waters who shared songwriting credits on \u201cThe Trial\u201d and from whom the band later temporarily distanced themselves after quarreling with him over several contentious issues. Even more than during the Animals sessions, Waters was asserting his artistic influence and leadership over the band, which prompted increased conflicts with the other members. The music had become distinctly more hard-rock, although the large orchestrations on some tracks recalled an earlier period, and there are a few quieter songs interspersed throughout (such as \u201cGoodbye Blue Sky\u201d and \u201cNobody Home\u201d). Wright\u2019s influence was completely minimized, and he was fired from the band during recording, only returning on a fixed wage for the live shows in support of the album. Ironically, Wright was the only member of Pink Floyd to make any money from The Wall concerts, the rest covering the extensive cost overruns of their most spectacular concerts yet.\n\nDespite never hitting #1 in the UK (it reached #3), The Wall spent 15 weeks atop the U.S. charts during 1980. Critics praised it, and it has sold over 30 million copies worldwide. It is the third-best selling album of all time in the U.S and the best selling album by a single artist to be released during the 1970s. It has been certified 23x platinum by the RIAA, for sales of 11.5 million copies in U.S. alone. The huge commercial success of The Wall made Pink Floyd the only artists since the The Beatles to have the best selling albums of two years (1973 and 1980) in less than a decade.\n\nA film entitled Pink Floyd: The Wall was released in 1982, incorporating essentially all of the music from the album. The film, written by Waters and directed by Alan Parker, starred The Boomtown Rats founder Bob Geldof and featured striking animation by noted British artist and cartoonist Gerald Scarfe. It grossed over $14 million at the North American box office. A song which first appeared in the movie, \u201cWhen the Tigers Broke Free\u201d, was released as a single on a limited basis. This song was finally made widely available on the compilation album Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd and the re-release of The Final Cut. Also in the film is the song \u201cWhat Shall We Do Now?\u201d, which was cut out of the original album due to the time constraints of vinyl records. The only song from the album not used was \u201cHey You\u201d, but a sequence was filmed using the song and it only exists as raw footage with poor visual quality but very good audio quality. It was released for the first time as a bonus with the extras section of the 1999 DVD release as a deleted scene.\n\n1983 saw the release of The Final Cut, dedicated to Roger Waters\u2019s father, Eric Fletcher Waters. Even darker in tone than The Wall, this album re-examined many previous themes, while also addressing then-current events, including Waters\u2019s anger at Britain\u2019s participation in the Falklands War, the blame for which he laid squarely at the feet of political leaders (\u201cThe Fletcher Memorial Home\u201d). It concludes with a cynical and frightening glimpse at the possibility of nuclear war (\u201cTwo Suns in the Sunset\u201d). Michael Kamen and Andy Bown contributed keyboard work in lieu of Richard Wright\u2019s departure, which had not been formally announced before the album\u2019s release. Though technically a Pink Floyd album, the LP\u2019s front cover displayed no words, only the back cover reading: \u201cThe Final Cut - A requiem for the post war dream by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd: Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Nick Mason\u201d. Roger Waters received the sole songwriting credit for the entire record, which became a prototype in sound and form for later Waters solo projects. Waters has since said that he offered to release the record as a solo album, but the rest of the band rejected this idea. However, in his book Inside Out, drummer Nick Mason says that no such discussions ever took place. Gilmour reportedly asked Waters to hold back the release of the album so that he could write enough material to contribute, but this request was refused. The music\u2019s tone is largely similar to The Wall\u2019s but somewhat quieter and softer, resembling songs like \u201cNobody Home\u201d more than \u201cAnother Brick in the Wall (Part 2)\u201d. It is also more repetitive, with certain leitmotifs cropping up continually. Only moderately successful with fans by Floyd\u2019s standards (UK #1, U.S. #6), but reasonably well-received by critics, the album yielded one minor radio hit, \u201cNot Now John\u201d, the only hard rock song on the album (and the only one partially sung by Gilmour). The arguments between Waters and Gilmour at this stage are rumored to be so bad that they were supposedly never seen in the recording studio simultaneously, and Gilmour\u2019s co-producer credit was dropped from the album sleeve (though he received attendant royalties). There was no tour for the album, although parts of it were performed live by Waters on his subsequent solo jaunts.\n\nAfter The Final Cut was released, the band members went their separate ways and spent time working on individual projects. Gilmour was the first to complete his solo album, releasing About Face in March 1984. Wright joined forces with Dave Harris of Fashion to form Zee, which released the experimental album Identity a month after Gilmour\u2019s project. In May 1984, Waters released The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, a concept album once proposed as a Pink Floyd project. A year after his band mates\u2019 projects, Mason released the album Profiles, a collaboration with Rick Fenn of 10cc which featured guest appearances by Gilmour and UFO keyboardist Danny Peyronel.\n\nWaters announced in December of 1985 that he was departing Pink Floyd, describing the band as \u201ca spent force creatively\u201d, but in 1986 Gilmour and Mason began recording a new Pink Floyd album. At the same time, Roger Waters was working on his second solo album, entitled Radio K.A.O.S.. A bitter legal dispute ensued with Waters claiming that the name \u201cPink Floyd\u201d should have been put to rest, but Gilmour and Mason upheld their conviction that they had the legal right to continue as \u201cPink Floyd.\u201d The suit was eventually settled out of court.\n\nAfter considering and rejecting many other titles, the new album was released as A Momentary Lapse of Reason (UK #3, U.S. #3). Without Waters, who had been the band\u2019s dominant songwriter for over a decade and a half, the band sought the help of outside writers. As Pink Floyd had never done this before (except for the orchestral contributions of Geesin and Ezrin), this move received much criticism. Ezrin, who had by now renewed his friendship with Gilmour, served as co-producer as well as being one of these writers. Rick Wright also returned, at first as a salaried employee during the final recording sessions, and then officially rejoining the band after the subsequent tour.\n\nGilmour later admitted that Mason had hardly played on the album. Because of Mason and Wright\u2019s limited contributions, some critics say that A Momentary Lapse of Reason should really be regarded as a Gilmour solo effort, in much the same way that The Final Cut might be regarded as a Waters album.\n\nA year later, the band released a double live album and a concert video taken from its 1988 Long Island shows, entitled Delicate Sound of Thunder, and later recorded some instrumentals for a classic-car racing film La Carrera Panamericana, set in Mexico and featuring Gilmour and Mason as participating drivers. During the race Gilmour and manager Steve O\u2019Rourke (acting as his map-reader) crashed. O\u2019Rourke suffered a broken leg, but Gilmour walked away with just some bruises. The instrumentals are notable for including the first Floyd material co-written by Wright since 1975, as well as the only Floyd material co-written by Mason since Dark Side of the Moon.\n\n1992 saw the box set release of Shine On. The 9 disc set included re-releases of the studio albums A Saucerful of Secrets, Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Wall, and A Momentary Lapse of Reason. A bonus disc entitled The Pink Floyd Early Singles was also included. The set\u2019s packaging featured a case allowing the albums to stand vertically together, with the side-by-side spines displaying an image of the Dark Side of the Moon cover. The circular text of each CD includes the almost illegible words \u201cThe Big Bong Theory\u201d.\n\nThe band\u2019s next recording was the 1994 release The Division Bell, which was much more of a group effort than Momentary Lapse had been, with Wright now reinstated as a full and contributing band member and figuring prominently in the writing credits. The album was received more favorably by critics and fans alike than Lapse had been, but was still heavily criticized as tired and formulaic. It was the second Pink Floyd album to reach #1 on both the UK and U.S. charts. The Division Bell was another concept album, in some ways representing Gilmour\u2019s take on the same themes Waters had tackled with The Wall. The title was suggested to Gilmour by his friend Douglas Adams. Many of the lyrics were co-written by Polly Samson, Gilmour\u2019s girlfriend at the time, whom he married shortly after the album\u2019s release. Besides Samson, the album featured most of the musicians who had joined the A Momentary Lapse of Reason tour, as well as saxophonist Dick Parry, a contributor to the mid-70s Floyd albums. Anthony Moore, who had co-written the lyrics for several songs on the previous album, penned the lyrics for a tune by Wright, \u201cWearing the Inside Out\u201d, Wright\u2019s first lead vocal on a Pink Floyd record since Dark Side of The Moon. Wright and Moore\u2019s writing collaboration continued on nearly every song on Wright\u2019s subsequent solo album, Broken China.\n\nAt the end of the tour in support of The Division Bell in1994, Gilmour stopped planning new music and tours for Pink Floyd, and the band went inactive.\n\nThe band released a live album entitled P*U*L*S*E in 1995. It hit #1 in U.S. and featured songs recorded during The Division Bell tour, primarily from concerts in London's Earls Court. The Division Bell concerts featured a mix of classic and modern Pink Floyd. The Pulse album has an entire performance of Dark Side of the Moon. VHS and Laserdisc versions of the concert at London's Earls Court 20 October 1994, were also released. A DVD edition was released on 10 July 2006 and quickly topped the charts. The original edition's CD case had an LED, timer IC, and battery which caused a red flash to blink once per second, like a heartbeat.\n\nIn 1995, the band received their first and only Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for \"Marooned\".\n\nOn 17 January 1996, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by The Smashing Pumpkins' frontman Billy Corgan. Roger Waters did not attend, still being antagonistic towards his former bandmates. At their acceptance speech, Gilmour - referring to the final verse of Dark Side of the Moon - said, \"I'll have to grab a couple more of these for our two band members that started playing different tunes; Roger and Syd...\". Although Mason was present to accept the award, he did not join Gilmour and Wright (and Billy Corgan) for their acoustic performance of 'Wish You Were Here'.\n\n1996 saw the release of Richard Wright's second solo album, Broken China, where he collaborated again with lyricist Anthony Moore.\n\nA live recording of The Wall was released in 2000, compiled from the 1980\u20131981 London concerts, entitled Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980\u201381. It reached #19 on the American album chart. In 2001, a remastered two-disc set of the band's best-known tracks entitled Echoes was released. Gilmour, Mason, Waters and Wright all collaborated on the editing, sequencing, and song selection of the included tracks. Minor controversy was caused due to the songs seguing into one another non-chronologically, presenting the material out of the context of the original albums. Some of the tracks, such as \"Echoes\", \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\", \"Marooned\", and \"High Hopes\" have had substantial sections removed from them. The album reached #2 on the UK and U.S. charts.\n\nIn 2003, an SACD reissue of Dark Side of the Moon was released with new artwork on the front cover. The album was also re-released as an 180 gram, virgin vinyl pressing in 2003, which included all the original album art from the original release of the album, albeit with a new poster. Nick Mason's book, Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd was published in 2004 in Europe and 2005 in the U.S. Long-time Pink Floyd manager Steve O'Rourke died on 30 October 2003. Gilmour, Mason and Wright reunited at his funeral and performed \"Fat Old Sun\" and \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" in Chichester Cathedral in tribute.\n\nTwo years later, on 2 July 2005, the band reunited for a one-off performance at the London Live 8 concert. This time, however, they were joined by Waters \u2014 the first time all four band members were on stage together in 24 years. The band performed a four-song set consisting of \"Speak To Me/Breathe (Breathe In The Air)\", \"Money\", \"Wish You Were Here\", and \"Comfortably Numb\", with both Gilmour and Waters sharing lead vocals. At the end of their performance Gilmour said \"thank you very much, good night\" and started to walk off the stage. Waters called him back, however, and the band shared a group hug that became one of the most famous images of Live 8.\n\nIn the week after Live 8, there was a revival of interest in Pink Floyd. According to record store chain HMV, sales of Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd went up, in the following week, by 1343%, while Amazon.com reported increases in sales of The Wall at 3600%, Wish You Were Here at 2000%, The Dark Side of the Moon at 1400% and Animals at 1000%. David Gilmour subsequently declared that he would donate his share of profits from this sales boom to charity, and urged all the other artists and record companies profiting from Live 8 to do the same. On 16 November 2005 Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend. Gilmour and Mason attended in person, explaining that Wright was in hospital following eye surgery, and Waters appeared on a video screen, from Rome.\n\nDavid Gilmour released his third solo record, On an Island, on 6 March 2006, and began a tour of small concert venues in Europe, Canada and the U.S. with a band including Richard Wright and other musicians from the post-Waters Pink Floyd tours. Roger Waters was also invited to join the band (along with Nick Mason) in London, but final rehearsals for his 2006 Europe/U.S. tour required him to decline. Nonetheless, Gilmour, Wright, and Mason's encore performances of \"Wish You Were Here\" and \"Comfortably Numb\" marked the first performance by Pink Floyd since Live 8. Waters was joined on stage by Mason for a few performances of Dark Side of the Moon during his 2006 tour. Wright was also invited to join Waters for the first performance, but Wright refused on the grounds that he had to work on his solo album (which remains unreleased). Waters' worldwide The Dark Side of the Moon Live tour consisted of Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety along with a selection of other Pink Floyd material and a small number of songs from Waters' solo career, although no songs from The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking or Radio K.A.O.S. were included. Waters is reported to be working on a solo album, and there has been talk of him doing a Broadway musical version of The Wall, with other Pink Floyd music to be inserted.\n\nMany fans expressed hope that the band's Live 8 appearance would lead to a reunion tour, and a record-breaking US$250 million deal for a world tour was offered, but the band made it clear that they had no such plans. In the weeks after the show, however, the rifts between the members seemed to have mostly healed. Gilmour confirmed that he and Waters are on \"pretty amicable terms\". Waters indicated that he would like to play together again not for a whole tour but for a single event, similar to Live 8.\n\nOn 31 January 2006, David Gilmour issued a joint statement on behalf of the group stating that they had no plans to reunite, refuting rumours from several media outlets. Gilmour later stated in an interview with La Repubblica that he is finished with Pink Floyd and wishes to focus on solo projects and his family. He mentions that he agreed to play Live 8 with Waters to support the cause, to make peace with Waters, and knowing he would regret not taking part. However, he states that Pink Floyd would be willing to perform for a concert \"that would support Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts\". Then speaking with Billboard, Gilmour changed his \"finished with Pink Floyd\" sentiment to \"who knows\".\n\n2007 saw the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd's signing to EMI and the 40th anniversary of the release of their first three singles \"Arnold Layne\", \"See Emily Play\" and \"Apples and Oranges\" and their debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. This was marked by the release of a limited edition set containing mono and stereo mixes of the albums, plus tracks from the singles and other rare recordings.\n\nOn 10 May 2007, Roger Waters performed at the Syd Barrett tribute concert at the Barbican Centre in London. This was then followed by a surprise performance by the post-Waters Pink Floyd line-up of David Gilmour, Richard Wright and Nick Mason of \"Arnold Layne\" to a rapturous applause and standing ovation. As it turned out, it would be the final time this configuration of Pink Floyd would ever perform together.\n\nHopes of a second reunion concert with the band's classic lineup were dashed when Waters did not perform with the group. Roger Waters took to the stage to screams of \"Pink Floyd!\" to which he responded, \"Later.\" Gilmour, Mason, and Wright took to the stage for what would be the final time to screams of \"Roger Waters!\" to which Gilmour politely responded, \"Yeah, he was here too, now the rest of us.\"\n\nIn a January 2007 interview, Waters suggested he had become more open to a Pink Floyd reunion: \u201cI would have no problem if the rest of them wanted to get together. It wouldn\u2019t even have to be to save the world. It could be just because it would be fun. And people would love it.\u201d\n\nOn 25 September 2007, Gilmour stated that a future reunion of Pink Floyd in any form, be it with or without Roger Waters, looked grim, stating that \"I can\u2019t see why I would want to be going back to that old thing. It\u2019s very retrogressive. I want to look forward, and looking back isn\u2019t my joy.\"\n\nIn December 2007, Pink Floyd released a new CD box set, Oh, By the Way, containing all fourteen studio albums with their newest respective CD remasters, original vinyl artwork plus new artwork from Storm Thorgerson. Mason and Waters had said that they would be happy to do a Pink Floyd tour, but during the BBC1 Special, \"Which One's Pink?,\" when asked about whether the band would reform, Gilmour ambiguously stated either \"Ain't gonna happen\" or \"Anything could happen\". Which of these two phrases were said is debatable. During the same documentary, Wright stated that he \"wouldn't mind playing the Pink Floyd 'music' again,\" but said nothing solid about reuniting with the actual members.\n\nIn a May 2008 interview for BBC 6Music, David Gilmour hinted that he would be in favour of another one-off show, but ruled out a full tour: \"Who knows? Who knows the future? I haven't absolutely said 'no' to the possibility but I think that in reality any sort of long-term thing together is not going to happen. We did the one-off thing and that was probably enough for me but we shall see. At my incredibly advantaged age \u2013having achieved this\u2013 I've earned the right to sit on my ass for a little while and consider what to do next.\" In 2008, Pink Floyd were awarded the Polar Music Prize for their contribution to contemporary music. Roger Waters and Nick Mason were present at the ceremony, where they received the prize from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden.\n\nSpeaking to Associated Press to promote the release of his new live album, David Gilmour revealed that a reunion \"categorically\" won't happen. Gilmour said: \"The [Live 8] rehearsals were less enjoyable. The rehearsals convinced me it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of. There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just that I've done that. I've been there, I've done it.\"\n\nOn 15 September 2008, Richard Wright died at age 65. He was lauded by his surviving bandmates, Gilmour in particular, for his influence on the overall sound of Pink Floyd.\n\nIn April 2009, it was revealed that the band had initiated legal action against EMI, their label for over four decades, for allegedly failing to pay royalties. The dispute is reportedly connected to an ongoing disagreement with Terra Firma Capital Partners, the private equity firm who took ownership of EMI in 2007.\n\nOn 10 July 2010, Roger Waters and David Gilmour performed together at a charity event for the Hoping Foundation. The event took place at Kidlington in Oxfordshire, England. The pair played to an audience of approximately 200. The event raised money for Palestinian children in order to give them a better life. Gilmour played this event in 2009, when he performed alongside Kate Moss. In return for Waters' appearance at the event, Gilmour has agreed to perform \"Comfortably Numb\" at one of Waters' upcoming performances of The Wall.\n\nOn 12 October 2010, Gilmour released Metallic Spheres, a collaboration with techno group The Orb\n\nIn 2011, Roger Waters embarked on a tour of \"The Wall\". He confirmed that David Gilmour would perform guitar and vocals on \"Comfortably Numb\" at one of the performances. Gilmour appeared at the 12 May 2011 concert at the O2 Arena in London. Gilmour and Nick Mason joined Waters at the end of the show for a performance of \"Outside the Wall\"\n\nOn 26 September 2011, Pink Floyd and EMI launched an exhaustive re-release campaign under the title Why Pink Floyd...?, reissuing the band's back catalogue in newly remastered versions, including special \"Immersion\" multi-disc multi-format editions. All the albums have been remastered by James Guthrie, the co-producer of The Wall.\n\nOn 7 July ]2014, the band announced they would be releasing their fifteenth studio album. \"The Endless River\". The record uses the 1994 ambient session known as \"The Big Spliff\" as its basis. The \"Big Spliff\" recording was expanded upon with material from recording sessions in 2013 and 2014. The record features material recorded by the late Rick Wright for the 1994 session, but does not include Roger Waters. \"The Endless River\" was released in November 2014.\n\nIn August 2015 David Gilmour announced that Pink Floyd had 'run its course' and was now officially disbanded. \n\nDiscography:\n-albums:\n\n1.

Speaking with Songfacts about this song in a 2011 interview, Phillip Sweet  explained: \"'Boondocks' was inspired by us just wanting to speak about who we are and what we're about. Because there seemed to be a little bit of confusion there at Sony when we were signed there that we were a put-together band, or we weren't country, we're too slick. And nowadays you wouldn't even get those kind of questions, but at that time it just seemed really strange. And I don't think radio really understood who we were yet. So we just wanted to write this, and it was therapy for us and it was a chance for us to really make a statement about our roots. And that's really what it was.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Little+Big+Town/_/Boondocks\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In the short time since Tornado, Little Big Town earned two number one radio hits with Tornado and Pontoon, a Grammy, two ACM and three CMA awards and an Emmy. They also found time to headline a sold-out tour, join Keith Urban across North America and host the CMA Music Festival: Countrys Night to Rock twice.****These hard-earned accolades and new opportunities provided a steady dose of inspiration at every turn, leading them to a fresh and very intentional approach to their latest studio album. They co-wrote most of Tornados songs as a group and knocked out production in a matter of weeks, whereas the road to Pain Killer was significantly longer in the making, and much more calculated.LBT intentionally began writing and curating their songs early in their tour for Tornado in May 2013. They followed the creative energy wherever it flowed by splitting into different writing combinations.We decided not to lock ourselves into writing as a group. We wanted a more relaxed and free approach, says Karen Fairchild. There was no pressure to write as certain groups at certain times. We followed the inspiration instead of forcing it.I dont know that we would have written Tumble and Fall if the boys had been in the room, she continues. The writing process on that song was very therapeutic for all of us girls. Just as Faster Gun is a guys song, it probably wouldnt have turned out the same way had the girls been in the room.New voices, including Ryan Tyndell, Blair Daly, Jeremy Spillman and Shane McAnally, joined long-term LBT collaborators, such as Hillary Lindsey, Liz Rose, Lori McKenna, Jedd Hughes and Natalie Hemby.As a result, Pain Killer covers all new territory for LBT. The band and its writing and production partners favored multi-layered effects. They drew from a mix of influences including vintage 50s country, 70s country, funk, groove, a cappella, bluegrass and straight up rock n roll.This evolution of LBT&#39;s sound is the outcome of their free reign to write and craft as they chose, making Pain Killer as uninhibited as their creative process.We dont think about boundaries anymore. We let go of that because it doesnt work for us. We do better when were freed up, Karen says.Phillip Sweet offers an enlightened perspective on songwriting. You chase whatever idea starts the creative process. It might be a lyric. It might be a melody. Sometimes a song unloads on you and you have to catch it and hang on for dear life. [Writing Pain Killer] was a healthy competition and motivating. The best songs won. There was no ego involved in that.Pain Killer proves LBT has a strong command on the courage it takes to create. We have learned to trust ourselves. Its confidence and experience. Were braver than weve ever been on this record, explains Kimberly Schlapman.LBT recorded 23 songs for Pain Killer, ultimately narrowing the album to 13. The creative process is such a living thing, says Jimi Westbook. Weve become good at acknowledging when its not working. Its easy to try to force it, but weve grown to understand when to move on. There came a point when the song selection came together and felt right. It had a great personality.The bonds LBT and producer, songwriter and musician extraordinaire Jay Joyce formed when producing Tornado carried over seamlessly into the creation of Pain Killer. This relationship, combined with the unstructured writing process and the use of their road band in the studio, gave way to a new adventure in experimenting with sound.Jimi makes an astute observation of Joyce, He is such an amazing, creative person and fun to work with. He takes you places you dont expect to go; and thats exciting, musically. You feel a lot of freedom in that.Jay is like a mad scientist. He uses our voices as instruments. Literally! Phillip exclaims. It was a deliberate choice to use our voices in ways we hadnt before. It was exhilarating.Todays recording standards are streamlined and corrected, manipulated and often times overpolished. Joyce makes music very differently, as found throughout critically acclaimed partnerships with artists such as Cage the Elephant, Amos Lee, Eric Church and Emmy Lou Harris.Jay doesnt believe in a cleaned up, pristine track, adds Karen. Sometimes you dont even know what layers exist. He will wake up in the middle of the night and go lay down some great, totally unexpected elements.Kimberly also enjoys Joyces creative drive. He is very spontaneous when recording. He leaves a lot in. Thats good for us!One sign of a successful collaboration is simple: LBT still listens to Pain Killer and hears sounds and effects they never noticed before, an experience musical craftsmen the world over are sure to envy.Pain Killer has a lot of different sounds without sounding unorganized, says Joyce. Its a more artistic album than LBT has done before. It has a lot of integrity.The provocative album has something for everyone: A treatment for the broken heart or the shattered spirit, a rally cry for those exhausted by love yet still inspired by it, a testament to the enduring hope of a long relationship, a promise of perseverance and a shot of good, old-fashioned fun.Pain Killer leads off with Quit Breaking Up with Me, a power pop anthem for those infamous on-again / off-again relationships that are plagued with drama and indecision. It has so much attitude! says Jimi. Written by Busbee, Natalie Hemby and Shane McAnally, its laced with punk, a shot of rock and rolls with LBTs characteristic country sass.Day Drinking was the first song LBT wrote as a group for Pain Killer, along with Troy Verges and Barry Dean, and is the albums first single. Its fanciful marching band and quirky whistles work together brilliantly to create a playful song of summer. People are genuinely happy when they hear it, adds Phillip. Day Drinking set the tone for the album, motivating LBT to innovate with each new song. Recently selected as Song of the Week by USA Today, this first single continues to climb the charts.Tumble and Fall, written by the ladies of LBT and Lori McKenna, Liz Rose and Hillary Lindsey, is a promise to persevere in a relationship despite the challenges and offenses that naturally arise. Its a reminder to be humble. Be vulnerable. Its a peaceful song, Kimberly adds. Featuring Jimis vocals and Kimberlys soaring harmonies, Tumble and Fall is both heartfelt and delightful.LBT knew early on in song selection that Pain Killer would be the title track. Music, like medicine, can be a vice, a drug, a muse. But in this case, Pain Killer refers to the love drug, says Karen. It is the magic potion made real, solving all problems with one fell swoop and intoxicating in the best way. Written by Karen, Jimi, Blair Daly and Lindsey, it is an upbeat, reggae-tinged tune perfect for a road trip, best enjoyed while riding with one hand out the window or on the back of a lovers neck.Perhaps the most affecting, jaw-dropping track is the down-tempo Girl Crush. This attention-grabber is stripped down to a power vocal with sparse backing. Karens soulful voice finds a fitting showcase against a retro beat, echoing the sounds of Patsy Cline and her contemporaries. Written by McKenna, Rose and Lindsey, it is one of the few songs to which every woman can relate. Girl Crush is one of the most brilliant lyrics Ive ever heard. It takes a modern phrase and turns it at the hook. And its empty in the right places. It gives me chills every time I listen to it because the raw emotion really comes through, Jimi explains.One of the more cinematic and barrier-breaking tracks is Faster Gun, written by Jeremy Spillman, Ryan Tyndell, Jimi and Phillip while in &quot;dude mode&quot; in the perfect place for men to be men a man cave, conveniently located at the studio. Faster Gun is one of the best examples of new sounds and layers for LBT. It sounds like a Tarantino flick raw and liberated. I could see it playing in my head like a trippy, acid western. Its completely different than anything weve done before, Phillip says. Faster Gun is the track that showcases LBT in a totally new light.Good People is a musical high five to partners in crime and is the glue binding all of the tracks together. We fell in love with it the minute we heard it. It felt great and we needed a moment like this on the record. It brought it to life, Phillip says. Joyce, Hemby and Spillman wrote the song which spotlights Kimberlys pure-tone soprano. This track is a gift to any friend who not only knows where the secrets are buried, but helped bury them.Stay All Night is upbeat, totally rockin and full of life. I love the groove. The phrasing is rapid fire and very rhythmic. Its funky cool! explains Jimi. Im so excited it made the record. The girls have lungs for days! Written by Jimi, Phillip, Brent Cobb and Jason Saenz, Stay All Night is the party song fitting for a no-holds-barred night out. Jimis vocals cranked the dial to 11 while Joyce tuned guitar strings to one chord and used the entire instrument as a horn. Full of personality, Stay All Night is a shining example of sonic details masterfully woven.Another powerful showcase of Kimberlys full and lively vocals is Save Your Sin. It was written by McKenna, Rose and Lindsey as a swift kick in the behind to someone less than worthy of anothers heart. The upbeat and pulsing track is just what Pain Killer needs. Kimberly freaking killed it, Jimi says. Its like the Foo Fighters meets country with a big screaming vocal..****", "img": null, "title": "Little Big Town", "url": "http://washingtondc.eventful.com/events/little-big-town-/E0-001-106912817-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "The Anthem", "city": "Washington"}, {"date": "2018-05-03 19:30:00", "description": " <p>After launching a historic sold-out year-long residency at Nashville\u2019s famed Ryman Auditorium, Grammy Award-winning vocal group Little Big Town announced they will bring their critically-acclaimed harmonies to arenas nationwide starting Spring 2018 with The Breakers Tour.

There is no lead singer in the band; instead, they trade lead vocal duties as well as rely on the harmonies of the four members.\n\nLittle Big Town's self-titled 2002 debut for Sony's Monument Records was panned critically and did not sell commercially. The album had only one minor hit single, \"Don't Waste My Time,\" and it wasn't long before Little Big Town was dropped from the label.\n\nLittle Big Town resurfaced on the Equity Music Group label (formed by country singer Clint Black), and on October 4, 2005, released their second album, The Road to Here. The new album was well-received critically, and spawned the smash hit single \"Boondocks.\" Three further singles were released from the album, including the Top 5 hit \"Bring It on Home.\"\n\nTheir second album with the Equity label, A Place to Land, was released in 2007. Although, not long after its release, the label folded. Little Big Town then re-released the album a year later via Capitol Nashville. Two of the album's singles were minor Top 40 hits. \n\nIn 2010, the group returned with \"Little White Church,\" the lead-off to their fourth studio album, The Reason Why, which was released on August 24, 2010.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Little+Big+Town\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Various line-up changes followed and during spring \u201994 Burning Heart Records released the EP \u201cKeep Out!\u201d.\u00a0<p>\u00a0<p>The singer Ulf left the band in the beginning of \u201995 and Rodrigo started singing while drumming. This was a temporary arrangement but after hearing Rodrigo sing and watching his double performance live everyone agreed that there was no need to look for a new vocalist.<p>\u00a0<p>Satanic played weekend shows in Sweden during spring and in May \u201995 a split CD with Ten Foot Pole was released on Bad Taste. The summer of \u201995 was spent rehearsing for their upcoming album. \u201cHero of our Time\u201d, which was released in September on Burning Heart and immediately became a big success. To date it has sold more than 60,000 copies. After the release of \u201cHero\u201d the band went on their first tour of Germany together with Millencolin. This opened their eyes to punk scene outside of Scandinavia and during spring the following year they did their first full European tour together with 59 Times the Pain. A Canadian tour followed in June as well as European festivals that summer.<p>\u00a0<p>By the end of \u201996 they recorded \u201c666 Motor Inn\u201d, which was released just in time for the Canadian Sno Jam tour in March \u201997. After the Sno Jam they went out on tour in Europe again, with The Almighty Trigger Happy. Another Euro tour followed in June together with Lag Wagon.\u00a0<p>\u00a0<p>In \u201998 they continued where they left off with a tour of Australia, a full European tour in March and then the work began on a new album. \u201cGoing Nowhere Fast\u201d was recorded in Nov/Dec and before actually being released, Tomek left the band and Magnus\u2019 twin brother, Mathias, took his place.<p>\u00a0<p>\u201cGoing Nowhere Fast\u201d was released in March and the band went across to Canada for the Sno Jam tour once again. The touring continued with lots of festival that summer and another European tour during fall. Again, the band needed to take some time off to regain their strength. There were a lot of things they weren\u2019t exactly happy about and for a while they were even considering starting over with a brand new name. Eventually they decided to continue playing under the Satanic Surfers name, but also to leave Burning Heart for Bad Taste and make severalother changes to ensure more control over their music once again.<p>\u00a0<p>Once all the decisions had been made the band was happier and more focused than they had been in the last five years! Their album \u201dFragments and Fractions\u201d was released in September 2000 and two days after that Satanic started their most successful European tour so far - 32 shows across Europe, 25 completely sold out! In Milan more than 3,500 people showed up! In November they returned to Canada for 10 dates on the East coast and during spring last year they did another hugely successful tour of Europe with sold out shows everywhere before taking a short and much needed break for summer.<p>\u00a0<p>During fall 2001 Rodrigo finally decided that touring as both a drummer and singer was getting too much for him. Within weeks they teamed up with old friend (and Bad Taste employee) Martin Svensson. After rehearsing frequently during winter the band entered Berno Studios in January to record their new album, \u201cUnconsciously Confined\u201d. 13 songs that sees the band continuing the transition started with the \u201cFragments and Fractions\u201d album with more mid-tempo, up beat pop songs together with the fast, melodic punk that has become their trademark. With a sound far surpassing all previous recordings and just over a dozen of the their best songs ever.\u00a0<p>\u00a0<p>Following an April 2002 release, a heavy touring schedule ensued. After three European tours and one across Canada, an otherwise successful year unfortunately ended with a cancelled South American tour and Martin\u2019s decision to quit the band, and return to the Bad Taste office. Rodrigo got back on drums and work on a new album started. However, progress was slow and rehearsals were few and far between. In August Mathias left the band in order to move to Berlin, Germany.<p>\u00a0<p>Now the band needed to find both a drummer and a bass player. In November, Andy (from Intensity) began rehearsing with the band and with his bass playing and his never-ending enthusiasm he proved to be the man for the job. In March 2004 the band got in touch with their friend Samsa (from Adhesive) to see if he was interested. Once he got together with the band in the rehearsal room, it didn\u2019t take long to decide on him being their new drummer. The Satanic line-up was complete for the first time in ages and rehearsals for upcoming shows began.<p>\u00a0<p>After completing three successful shows during May and June, the band did a two-week European tour in August and began writing their 6th album. \u201dTaste The Posion\u201d was recorded in spring 2005 and released in September 2005. The band then took off on tours in Europe, UK, Japan, and Brazil. Taste The Poison was released in all these territories, on different labels, with slightly variated artwork. Magnus left the band after Brazil (March 2006) and was replaced by Dana (from Venerea). They went to Canada for an almost 5 week long tour with Mad Caddies, Loved Ones, Subb, & The Resistance (Grind Tour), and followed up with European festivals during the summer.\u00a0<p>\u00a0<p>After 6 months of radio silence the band met up at a bar and called it quits. The press release was dated February 10th 2007 and since then all members have been active in other bands. Come present day, December 2014, the band has gotten back together with a new - yet secret - drummer and is currently rehearsing for summer shows 2015. More info TBA, stay tuned!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>", "img": null, "title": "SATANIC SURFERS + THE BENNIES + THE LAST GANG + BITTER GROUNDS", "url": "http://munich.eventful.com/events/satanic-surfers-bennies-last-gang-bitter-grou-/E0-001-108846572-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "Germany", "venue": "Backstage", "city": "Munich"}, {"date": "2018-03-03 19:00:00", "description": " On sale: Friday, 1/12 @ 10am Door 7 / Show 8 TICKET INFORMATION\u00a0 \u2022 Slim&#39;s is an ALL AGES (6+) venue. \u2022\u00a0No refunds or exchanges are permitted, except in the case of headliner cancellation or date change.

They released their first two albums on Hellcat Records/Epitaph Records before moving to Sire, part of the Warner Music Group. The Distillers is originally formed by Australian-born Brody Dalle. As lead singer, she adopted a signature harsh singing voice. Although there were constant line-up changes, Brody consistently played the guitar, sang, and wrote or co-wrote nearly every song on all the band's albums. Tony Bradley also played guitar and Ryan Sinn played bass.Before this more solid line up, early band members included guitarist/vocalist Rose Casper, bassist Kim Chi and drummer Matt Young.\n\nThe Distillers split for the very first time in 2004, Brody and Tony have since formed a new band called Spinnerette. Ryan Sinn joined Angels & Airwaves after The Distillers split, but left A&A after two years.\n\nBrody announced the emergence of Spinnerette,  a semi-solo project in March 2007. She stated in an interview that, \"Spinnerette isn't a band, it's me and whichever musicians I want to work with at the time.\" Spinnerette released a digital EP called Ghetto Love, via their Official Website on December 11th, 2008. On June 9th, 2009 the band made their entire debut album available for listening on their MySpace page. The album, Spinnerette, was released in the UK on June 15th, 2009. The first single was Baptized By Fire.\n\nIn November 2012, Brody Dalle announced on Twitter that she was working on a solo album, featuring Alain Johannes and Michael Shuman of Queens of the Stone Age and Shirley Manson of Garbage.\n\nIn November 2013, Dalle announced that she had signed to Caroline Records, a division of Universal Music Group, with the intention of releasing her debut solo album in early 2014. The album was produced by Alain Johannes, and features guest appearances from Shirley Manson of Garbage, Nick Valensi of the Strokes, and Warpaint's Emily Kokal. Dalle is scheduled to promote the album and support Nine Inch Nails and Queens of the Stone Age on their Australia/New Zealand tour in March 2014.\n\nIn January 3rd, 2018 Brody Dalle and the band shared a short 30 second trailer video teasing new material and captioned with the words \u2018THE DISTILLERS 2018\u2019. Dalle has also changed her Facebook cover photo to The Distillers logo. During 2017 Dalle shared photos of herself at work in the studio.\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Distillers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The move to Nashville, when it finally came, wasnt so much about a change of scenery for the talented, young songsmiths as it was about committing everything to music-making as a vocationan all the eggs in one basket gamble to pursue a career as artists.And speaking of eggs, chickens did figure oddly into that decision.There are more chickens than people in the state of Delaware, Jenny laughs, so as much as we love our little home state, the music scene there is a bit limited. You can only grow so much. Tyler had just been offered a sales job with a local tool company. But then he came to me and said I cant do this. It sounds like a small thing, but that was the pivotal moment. It was scary. With that decision, we knew without saying it that this music we had been chasing was really going to be our lives, whether it brought security or not.Now, with the release of their first label project, Of This Im Sure, that gutsy decision comes to fruition. Jenny & Tylers unexpectedly mature sound melds a diverse set of influences into something new that is at the same time both yearning and comforting. Throughout the projects twelve songs, their easy voices blend in harmonies that suggest a deep hope and a deep ache intertwined. Artful without being pretentious, Of This Im Sure seems to have its deepest roots in the influences of lyrically emotive, UK folk-pop stylings. The UKs Glen Hansard, Foy Vance, and Laura Marling have provided inspiration for the duo. Even as Jenny & Tylers vocal pairings take center stage, the song production remains vast and lush, and at times, soaring.Weve been writing love songs from the beginning, Tyler explains, though theyre not all stereotypically romantic. We see songs of friendship and social justice and the divine as love songs too. Theyre all about the passion and connection of relationships with people we love. So in that sense, Of This Im Sure is really a collection of love songs, and love is such an inexhaustible theme. We wanted the whole album to have the feel of an ocean. We wanted it to be layered and full in a way that would compliment the words we were singing. We were thrilled with our producer Gabe Scott (The Civil Wars, Ingrid Michaelson, Matt Kearney) and his ability to take us there.The albums first single, Song For You, is a haunting entreaty of unrequited love that begins in sparse simplicity and steadily builds to a vast crescendo of emotion. Weve been writing more songs of brokenness like this recently, Jenny explains. A lot of these songs tell the story of a specific persontheyre actually written for people we know. When people in your life are in pain, you grieve for them. You feel the hurt when they make choices that are self-destructive. You just want to bring them close and embrace them, but sometimes pouring that emotion into a song is the only outlet you have to express it.The songwriting chemistry that exists between Jenny & Tyler goes back several years to their college days when they first met on a bus and started backing each other up as solo performers. Nowadays when they write, one of them will typically start an idea, and bring it to the other for completion. Melodies and lyrics become a shared creation.Weve made a safe place, Jenny says, where its okay to really be honest in our writing together.Well delve into depths of darkness and despair at times, Tyler agrees, but theres always a light in there as well. The key to our writing is that were always really deliberate about telling the story of the lyrics through the music. If the line is a question, we make the melody uncertain. If the mood is happy, we paint it in a major scale. If its dark or yearning, we want the track to communicate that same emotion. A song doesnt feel complete to us if it doesnt do that.The darkest and most musically intense cut on the project is probably the pleading epic My Dear One, a pained invitation to a loved one who has turned their back on those who long to restore them.We really process life through songwriting, Tyler says. Its how we deal with hard things, and I guess its a way to keep people in our minds and hearts. My Dear One has this tense interplay of sweetness vs. darkness, and you hear that tension reflected in the call and response contrast between the strings and the electric guitars.While most of the songs on Of This Im Sure reflect some kind of internal tension, not all of them are dark. Walk With You came as the result of years of attempts to write a non-cheesy friendship love song, Tyler explains. The track is a piano driven pop song that utilizes wide swings in dynamic intensity to communicate the message.Walk With You has gentleness and intensity in the same song, Tyler says, because its about a commitment to walk with a friend through some really hard times, and its about speaking the truth directly. Loving and being loved isnt always easy. Theres an intensity of commitment thats required even to keep a real friendship together, and thats what we were trying to capture in this song.Another cut rooted in unwavering commitment is In Everything You Do. Written for Jenny & Tylers two young daughters, In Everything You Do expresses a parents desire to shield their children from the inevitable pains and fears of life.You want to protect them, Jenny says, but you cant. What you can do is hold them and teach them and love them, and walk through those difficult places with them. This song is kind of a promise. Sonically, it has a sort of old west feel to it like a glowing sunset. It conjures up images of open spaces, of loneliness. But theres also this strength and comfort and commitment of us saying that no matter what, were going to be there for them.Though Jenny & Tyler agree that their previous indie release, Faint Not, is the one that really marked the beginning of their careers, they both see their official label debut with Residence Music as a huge step forward.Weve been doing music independently for seven years, Tyler explains, and didnt know if it would ever make sense to sign with a label. But the people who started Residence Music have an artistic vision that matches up perfectly with our own. They want to make music without boundaries, and thats what were all about too. It seemed like a perfect fit.Theyre taking artists that dont fit in a box, Jenny adds, and trying to help them flourish. The bottom line is; we trust the people at the label. We believe that they can take our vision as artists, and help translate it into something even bigger.", "img": null, "title": "Jenny & Tyler", "url": "http://eventful.com/waco/events/jenny-tyler-/E0-001-109665819-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Common Grounds", "city": "Waco"}], "description": "Foy Vance is a songsmith born in Bangor, County Down, who is now living in London.

" <br> Chad VanGaalen -- Light InformationNobody cared about their old heads, because the new ones work just fine now, don&#39;t they?.... they have the same size mouth and eyes.The song Old Heads is a sci-fi space anthem to technology that constantly replaces itself, proving both necessary and unnecessary at the same time. Its also a jangly pop gem, a trip through the fantastical that is ultimately warm and relatable. This remarkable coexistence is one of many achievements of Chad VanGaalens Light Information, his sixth record on Sub Pop, due September 8th. For an album thats about not feeling comfortable with really anything, as Van Gaalen says, Light Information is nonetheless a vivid, welcoming journey through future worlds and relentless memories. The rich soundscapes and sometimes jarring imagery (Ill be the host body, yes, for the parasitic demons. They can eat me from the inside out, I already hear them chewing.) could only come from the mind of a creative polymath--an accomplished visual artist, animator, director, and producer, VanGaalen has scored television shows, designed puppet characters for Adult Swim, directed videos for Shabazz Palaces, Strand of Oaks, METZ, Dan Deacon, and The Head and the Heart, and produced records for Women, Alvvays, and others.While alienation has always been a theme of VanGaalens music, Light Information draws on a new kind of wisdom--and anxiety--gained as he watches his kids growing up. Being a parent has given me a sort of alternate perspective, worrying about exposure to a new type of consciousness that&#39;s happening through the internet, he says. I didnt have that growing up, and Im maybe trying to preserve a little bit of that selfishly for my kids.As always, VanGaalen wrote, played, and produced all of the music on Light Information (save Ryan Bournes bass part on Mystery Elementals and vocals on Static Shape from his young daughters Ezzy and Pip), and designed the cover art. The product of six years work, going back even before 2014s Shrink Dust, Light Information emerged from the experimental instruments that fill the VanGaalens Calgary garage studio. Among them is a beloved Korg 770 monosynth, which VanGaalen coveted for years before fixing one up and devoting a lot of recent energy to recording duets with it. One of these, Prep Piano and 770, is the lone instrumental on Light Information, more atmosphere and chord bursts than the rest of the albums hooky rock narrative.If I was going to go out and buy a record, I would probably want it to sound only like that, says VanGaalen. That ones for me.Throughout the dark-wave reverb of Light Information are stories of paranoia, disembodiment, and isolation--but theres also playfulness, empathy, and intimacy. I sit and do a drawing, a portrait of my dad, sings VanGaalen on Broken Bell. I should really visit him before he is dead. Cuz we are getting old. Our cells just wont divide like they told us. But Im not really good at this kind of thing.But VanGaalen is good at a lot of things--and hes trying to pursue them for the right reasons. I&#39;m just trying to get over the weight of feeling like I have to be making something of my time constantly, he says. Especially with kids, you get these small breaks where you get to make stuff, and now I try to say you know what, I&#39;m going to make something for me.And if he could make anything for himself, it would be without constraint. I would love to build a living structure from scratch, he says. I&#39;ve slowly been ripping my studio apart and building additions, but you&#39;re always kind of down to this box.

With Diaper Island, VanGaalen distills his approach, producing his most sonically cohesive album to date, and the closest thing he has done to a rock album.\n\nAlso a celebrated visual artist, VanGaalen is widely renowned for his illustration and animation work. As with his previous albums \u2013 Infiniheart, Skelliconnection and the Polaris short-listed Soft Airplane, VanGaalen illustrated all of the art for Diaper Island \u2013 and is in the midst of animating a music video as well. He has animated music videos for folks like J Mascis, Guster, and Holy Fuck, and his videos have been collectively viewed well over a million times on YouTube.\n\nVanGaalen has been quietly building a catalogue of songs that invite listeners to gently explore his distinctive creativity. Diaper Island extends the adventure into deeper territory, tapping into VanGaalen's lifeblood and mining the richness of his mind with sharper tools.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chad+VanGaalen\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He has since released 2000's S.D.E, 2002's Come Home With Me, 2004's Purple Haze, 2006's Killa Season and 2009's Crime Pays.\n\nCam'ron made his acting debut on the 2002 film Paid in Full, where he played the character Rico, who is based on former Harlem drug dealer Alpo. In 2006, Cam'ron would return to his acting career and make his debut in screen writing in his movie Killa Season. Cam'ron plays a high school basketball player who eventually drops out of high school to begin his own drug ring. The movie was released in 2006, simultaneous with the Killa Season album. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cam%27ron\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In England, he is recognised as something of a national institution yet, because much of his songwriting is rooted in English culture, he has remained essentially a national rather than an international star.  \n\nWeller's eleventh studio album, Sonik Kicks, was released on 19 March 2012. The Green Songfacts reports that it was recorded in Weller\u2019s own Black Barn Studios in Ripley, Surrey, with co-producer Simon Dine and engineer Charles Rees.\n\nBorn John William Weller in Stanley Road, Woking, he was also a central figure in the Mod revival. As the leader of the Jam, Paul Weller fronted the most popular British band of the punk era, influencing legions of English rockers that ranged from his mod-revival contemporaries to the Smiths in the '80s and Oasis in the '90s. During the final days of the Jam, he developed a fascination with Motown and soul, which led him to form the sophisti-pop group the Style Council in 1983. As the Style Council's career progressed, Weller's interest in soul developed into an infatuation with jazz-pop and house music, which eventually led to gradual erosion of his audience \u2014 by 1990, he couldn't get a record contract in the UK, where he had previously been worshipped as a demi-god. As a solo artist, Weller returned to soul music as an inspiration, cutting it with the progressive, hippie tendencies of Traffic. Weller's solo records were more organic and rootsier than the Style Council, which helped him regain his popularity within Britain. By the mid-'90s, he had released three successful albums which were both critically-acclaimed and massively popular in England, where contemporary bands like Ocean Colour Scene were citing him as an influence. Just as importantly, many observers, while occasionally criticizing the trad-rock nature of his music, acknowledged that Weller was one of the few rock veterans that had managed to stay vital within the second decade of his career.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Weller\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

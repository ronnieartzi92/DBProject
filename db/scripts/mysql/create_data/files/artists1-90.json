It was released as a single in 2003, and is one of the best-known songs from the band. Seven Nation Army reached #1 on the Modern Rock Tracks for three weeks and won 2004's Grammy Award for Best Rock Song. The song is known for its underlying riff, which plays throughout most of the song. Although it sounds like a bass guitar (an instrument the group had famously never previously used), the sound is actually created by running Jack White's semi-acoustic guitar (a 1950s style Kay Hollowbody) through a whammy pedal set down an octave. The riff was composed at a sound check before a show at the Corner Hotel in Melbourne, Australia, according to the set notes in the booklet which accompanied the Under Blackpool Lights DVD. The riff was inspired by the main theme of the Fifth Symphony composed by Anton Bruckner (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgXBp-oEIR0&feature=youtu.be&t=21m29s).\n\nThe song shows a rare example of the Phrygian Half Cadence in popular music. It is also a rare example of a popular song with a wholly instrumental refrain.\n\nAccording to White, \"Seven Nation Army\" was what he used to call the Salvation Army as a child.\n\nIn March 2005, Q magazine placed \"Seven Nation Army\" at number 8 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. In September 2005, NME placed \"Seven Nation Army\" at number 5 in its list of the 50 Greatest Tracks Of The Decade. In May 2008, Rolling Stone placed this song at number 21 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time. \n\nA remix of the song was used in the trailer for Battlefield 1, which caused the song to spike up to the low 100's on Itunes charts.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+White+Stripes/_/Seven+Nation+Army\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Click the link below to go to iTunes now http://www.warnerbrosrecords.com/click/click...."}, "description": "\"Icky Thump\" is a Grammy Award-winning song recorded by the American alternative rock band The White Stripes. Written by Jack White, it is the first single released from Icky Thump.\n\nThe name of the track comes from the Northern England exclamation \"Ecky Thump,\" roughly meaning \"what the heck?\" The title was then changed to \"Icky\" so that \"teenagers would understand it better back in America,\" in the same way Led Zeppelin took out the \"a\" so Americans wouldn't call them 'Lead Zeppelin' (pronounced 'leed')\" . The phrase was popularized in an episode of The Goodies.\n\nThough grounded to a greater degree than the Get Behind Me Satan singles in straightforward garage rock, the song differed radically from previous White Stripes singles in its unusual construction: angular tempo-changes, stream-of-consciousness lyrics, and chaotic improvised snake-charming solos, played on a Univox synthesizer.\n\nThe song deals with the topic of immigration [7]. The song itself seems to criticize the current immigration policy, something seen also in the video. It is thus the first political White Stripes track since \"The Big Three Killed My Baby,\" off The White Stripes.\n\nThe lyrics talk about someone (perhaps Jack White himself) taking a trip to Mexico in a wagon, easily crossing the border to Mexico, as opposed to the difficulties Mexican immigrants face while illegally crossing northwards. It then mentions a Mexican lady giving him a bed to sleep in, then tying him up and holding him hostage. When finally able to escape, White decides to start doing his own house chores (referring, most likely, to the hiring of illegal immigrants as very low paid house servants). In the video, when White escapes the lady's house and crosses back to the USA, he passes by Mexican workers building a wall, likely the so-called Great Wall of Mexico.\n\nThe defining verse against immigration policies comes near the end of the song:\n\nWhite Americans What? Nothin' better to do? Why don't you kick yourself out? You're an immigrant too.\n\nWho's using who? What should we do? Well you can't be a pimp And a prostitute too.\n\nThe song also ended the 15-week run of \"What I've Done\" by Linkin Park at the top of the Modern Rock Tracks chart. It is the second song by the White Stripes to top the chart, after \"Seven Nation Army.\" The song is sandwiched between the 15 week run at number 1 of \"What I've Done and \"The Pretender\" by Foo Fighters 18 week run, separated by only the 1 week appearance of \"Paralyzer\" by Finger Eleven. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+White+Stripes/_/Icky+Thump\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Live, the sound is produced by a bass-rich guitar tone, used in combination with a whammy pedal to create the heavily metallic sounding breaks of the song (\"How dare you, how old are you now anyway\" and \"get behind me, get behind me now anyway\".)\n\nThe single comes in three editions, each with different additional tracks. All three covers feature two people dressed up as The White Stripes, but are noticeably different people. The first CD and the 7\" feature the couple in the same order as Get Behind Me Satan, with 'Jack' on the right. The second CD version features 'Jack' on the left.\n\nIn an NPR interview, Jack White referred to \"Blue Orchid\" as the song that saved the album. He has denied that the song relates to the ending of his relationship with Ren\u00e9e Zellweger.\n\nThe video for \"Blue Orchid\" was on Yahoo!'s Top Twenty Scariest Music Videos of all Time, charting at number 13. It features Karen Elson, a model who would marry Jack White soon after the shoot. The video, which was directed by Floria Sigismondi, ends with a horse, its hooves raised in the air, about to stomp on Elson, but just before the hooves land on her, the video quickly goes black, ending.\n\n\"Blue Orchid\" has been remixed by High Contrast on the album Fabric Live 25, and is the first track on disc 2 of the album. It features the main guitar riff accompanied by a much more Drum and Bass inspired backing drum beat. The vocals from the song, \"You took a white orchid, you took a white orchid and turned it blue\" repeated at various points throughout the track.\n\nThe song is used as the theme song for the Australian Radio Show Wil & Lehmo on Triple M\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+White+Stripes/_/Blue+Orchid\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is the third single from their album Elephant. The cover of the single is an allusion to the graphics of Saul Bass, seen in the movie posters and title sequences of films such as Anatomy of a Murder and The Man with the Golden Arm.\n\nJack White says that the song is about a child trying to find his place in a dysfunctional family when a new baby comes.\n\n\nThe music video for \"The Hardest Button to Button\" is the third White Stripes video directed by Michel Gondry, after \"Fell in Love with a Girl\" and \"Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground\" (two years later, he would direct the music video for \"The Denial Twist\").\n\nThe video utilizes pixilation animation to create the effect of dozens of drum kits and guitar amplifiers multiplying to the rhythm of the song as Jack and Meg perform. For example, in one sequence, Meg is seen playing the bass drum at a subway station. At every beat she plays, she appears with a new bass drum while the last becomes vacant. This was achieved by first setting up a trail of bass drums. Then, Meg would be filmed performing a single beat on the last drum in the line, followed by the removal of that drum. Meg would then proceed to the next drum, play another beat, and so on. The final video is edited to include the drum beats with the sequence reversed, making it appear as if the drums are being added to the beat, appearing out of thin air. As many as 80 identical bass drums and Fender guitar amps were used in the video.\n\nMuch of the video was filmed around Riverside Drive and the Columbia University area near Grant's Tomb and around the 125th Street exit and surrounding neighborhood, - all part of the Upper West Side in Manhattan - New York City. Parts of the video were filmed at the 33rd Street PATH station.\n\nThere is a short cameo by Beck about two and a half minutes in as a man in a white suit presenting Jack with a \"box with something in it\".\n\nThis song and a parody of the video features in the episode of The Simpsons, Jazzy and the Pussycats. The White Stripes appear as themselves in the episode, in which Bart learns to play the drums. He is seen playing the drums around Springfeild in the same fashion as Meg in this song's video, ending in a collision and chase with The White Stripes themselves.\n\n\nReleased \tDecember 9, 2003\nFormat \tCD, 7\"\nRecorded \tApril 2003\nGenre \tAlternative rock, garage rock revival\nLength \t3:32\nLabel \tXL Recordings\nProducer \tJack White <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+White+Stripes/_/The+Hardest+Button+to+Button\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Jack White originally planned for this song to be much softer and done with an acoustic guitar.\n\nThe video for this song, directed by Michel Gondry, depicts Jack White coming back to his and Meg White's trashed house and surveying the destruction. While he goes from room to room, video of the party that led to the destruction, and of his and Meg's relationship before he left, is projected and occasionally super-imposed over the scene.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+White+Stripes/_/Dead+Leaves+and+the+Dirty+Ground\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Hotel Yorba is a former hotel in southwest Detroit that is now used as government subsidized housing, and the single version was recorded in a room there. The White Stripes shot much of the song's music video outside the hotel, but were denied permission to film inside; according to Jack White, the duo is \"sort of banned for life\" from the hotel.\n\nThe song is primarily built around three chords G, C and D, but a fourth, F, is also heard.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia) <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+White+Stripes/_/Hotel+Yorba\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band&#39;s fifth LP will be released on Badman Recordings Co, which will be their third release with the label.Their last album was hailed by Consequence of Sound, who said, The Builders and the Butchers make records the way the bards used to pass on stories. Theyre poetic and captivating, and do to songwriting what Clint Eastwood does to movies, and this new record follows the same, narrative-driven path.With comparisons to The Decemberists coming from Pitchfork and The Wall Street Journal, among others, their brand of folk-rock is best served live. Audiences can look forward to lively performances, where fourth wall is broken and the audience is able to participate in call and response sing-a-longs. Sometimes the band will hand out instruments for fans to play, and theyll even get down off stage to perform right on the floor.The Builders and The Butchers formed in 2005. Ryan Sollee fronts the band, sings and plays guitar, joined by Willy Kunkle (bass, guitar, vocals, percussion), Justin Bair (drums, backup vocals, percussion) and Harvey Tumbleson (mandolin, banjo, guitar, vocals, percussion). The Portland-based band gained a strong following after years of playing anywhere and everywhere across the city. They quickly grew to become one of the most exciting live bands in Portland and throughout the Pacific Northwest.The band toured throughout the US and Europe from 2007-2012, playing music festivals, such as Sasquatch and Lollapalooza, and acting as support for Portugal. The Man, Heartless Bastards, Amanda Palmer and Murder By Death. To support their forthcoming release, The Spark, the band will be playing their first US and European tour in multiple years.This new album features a wider array of sounds and shorter, impactful songs, while remaining a Builders record at heart. The process of creating The Spark was the longest of any Builders record to date. They spent the last five years writing the music and a year mixing. With several band members living out of state (Justin in Colorado, Willy in Malta, Harvey in Washington and Ryan and Ray in Portland), many parts were recorded remotely.

Produced by guitarist Derek Miller, and written by Miller and singer Alexis Krauss, Reign of Terror is the highly anticipated follow up to 2010&#39;s Treats, an album whose deft, stylish combination of genres, sounds, and dynamics was simply unprecedented. Treats&#39; own extreme volume was matched by the deafening roar of praise, landing the band on over 50 year-end lists for 2010. Sleigh Bells toured behind Treats relentlessly, opening for the likes of LCD Soundsystem, Hot Chip, Yeasayer and Major Lazer before headlining their own shows, many of which sold out in minutes. They played lauded, exhilarating sets at festivals around the globe, confirming their status as a sheer tour de force on the stage. It is this intense live energy, coupled with the continued desire to carve out new musical terrain, which runs throughout their new album, Reign of Terror. Engineered by Shane Stoneback, who helped to record Treats, songs on Reign of Terror are as crushing and authoritative as their title suggests; they&#39;re effortlessly robust and heavier than any of the band&#39;s previous output, but more melodic as well. Packed densely with stomping beats, shredding Jackson guitar riffs, sinister ribbons of Alexis Krauss&#39; candy-coated vocals, and the cries of a pep rally gone terribly wrong, Reign of Terror is a record that, like its predecessor, redefines everything you think music can be. <br><br> http://reignofterror.tv/", "title": "Sleigh Bells, Sunflower Bean", "url": "http://houston.eventful.com/events/sleigh-bells-sunflower-bean-/E0-001-107665103-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "White Oak Music Hall", "date": "2018-02-07 20:00:00"}, {"city": "Highbury", "description": " Line-up /<p>The Libertines, The Strokes, <a>Arctic Monkeys</a>, The Killers, <a>Kings Of Leon</a>, Arcade Fire, The Cribs, <a>Bloc Party</a>, The Futureheads, <a>MGMT</a>, <a>Hot Chip</a>, The Maccabees, Interpol, Jamie T, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Tom Vek, The Hives, Razorlight, Babyshambles, Kasabian, Modest Mouse, Good Shoes, Le Tigre, The Von Bondies, The Vines, The Walkmen, Larrikin Love, The Rakes, The <a>THRILLS</a>, Maximo Park, Kaiser Chiefs, Modest Mouse, <a>Foals</a>, The White <a>Stripes</a>, The Sunshine Underground, <a>Klaxons</a>, The Kooks, The Wombats, Testicicles, The View, The Holloways, Franz Ferdinand, B.R.M.C, The Bravery, Editors, Vampire Weekend, <a>The Rapture</a>, The Coral, The Fratellis, The Postal Service, <a>LCD Soundsystem</a>, Tv on the Radio, Har Mar Superstar, The Delays, Two Door Cinema Club, <a>Metronomy</a>, <a>Empire Of The Sun</a>, Cage The Elephant, The Subways, The Ordinary Boys, <a>CSS</a>, The Gossip.<p> Gonzo x The Garage present:<br> * * THE BIG INDIE DISCO! * *<br><br> Travel with us back to the glory days of 00s indie at London&#39;s best alternative venue and club, The Garage!

Having considered names like ?Yellow Lilo? and ?Die Wit Ding Wat in Die Pad Le?, it was Chris? dream of playing to the sound of a stadium boo-ing the band that eventually won out. Although the name was designed to thwart any chances of feedback on a bad performance, this contingency was never required as Boo! became not only one of South Africa?s favourite bands of all time, but also one of the country?s proudest musical exports to both Europe and North America.\n\nDuring the following 7 years Boo! acquired an impressive cult following worldwide, performing approximately 800 gigs in 17 countries. Brandishing their self-styled genre ?monkipunk?, Boo! performed at various European and American festivals with the likes of the White Stripes, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, Franz Ferdinand, Smashing Pumpkins, Cypress Hill, Placebo and Coldplay amongst others. The band also received a South African Music Award (SAMA) in 2002 for ?Best Pop Album?. The band?s sound consisted of bass, drums, brass, keyboards and percussion; notably lacking guitar. In spite of this unusual orchestration, Boo! hit the number one position on the 5FM top 40 with ?Stagefright? and a number two position with ?OOAA?, testimony to frontman, bassist and resident drag queen, Chris Chameleon?s exceptional songwriting abilities. \n\nIn 2018 Boo! will celebrate their 21st birthday. This looks to being a momentous occasion with an album in the works, a documentary and tours in South Africa and abroad. Monki Punk may become Guerilla Punk, three may become two plus special guests, but the band worth the biggest and most appreciative denouncement of all remains on stage, electrified by that most beautiful sound to their ears: BOOOOOOOOOO!", "title": "Boo!

Their successful albums White Blood Cells and Elephant drew them attention from a large variety of media outlets in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n \nThe White Stripes used a low-fidelity, do-it-yourself approach to writing and recording. Their music features a melding of punk and blues influences and a raw simplicity of composition, arrangement, and performance. The duo is also noted for their fashion and design aesthetic which features a simple color scheme of red, white, and black.\n\nThe White Stripes' discography consists of six studio albums, two extended plays (EP), one video album, 26 singles and fourteen music videos. The band has sold approximately 12 million albums worldwide, 2 million in the US alone, and their latest three albums have each won a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.\n\nOn February 2, 2011, the band announced on their website that they had disbanded.\n\nOfficial band website: www.whitestripes.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+White+Stripes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was ranked #14 on VH1's 40 Greatest Metal Songs [1].\n\nThe song is in C minor key and it is played on dropped C tuned guitar.[citation needed]\n\n\"Toxicity\" is a downloadable song for the music video game series Rock Band, and is a featured track in Guitar Hero: Metallica.\n\nIt made #53 on the Y2KROQ Top 200 Songs of the Century.\n\nThe video was directed by Shavo Odadjian.

It was written by guitarist Daron Malakian, who also provides lead vocals on the track. The song received a nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\"Lonely Day\" features a dreary musical theme with a heavy chorus and a dual guitar solo near the end. The chorus is notable for featuring the double superlative \"most loneliest\".\nThe song is featured in the 2007 film Disturbia, as well as the film's trailer; however, it is not included in the film's soundtrack. Daron did not write the song as a tribute to his brother as rumored, as Daron is an only child.\nThe music video features the band on a tour bus with interspliced shots of Hollywood and sections on fire. About 45 seconds into the video, there is a reference to the Pink Floyd Wish You Were Here album sleeve on a reflected piece of glass. The doodle that bassist Shavo Odadjian is seen to be sketching in the video can be found on his Facebook profile. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/System+of+a+Down/_/Lonely+Day\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was released as an unofficial airplay-only single, and a promotional live video of the song was released.\n\nWritten by Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian, the lyrics are about the United States prison industrial complex, the world's largest. The song expresses the belief that the government is partially responsible for the spread of the use of illegal drugs and thus somewhat responsible for the fact that more than half of the inmates in American federal prisons are there for drug-related charges. Though the song is mostly sung by lead vocalist, Tankian, a few lines preceding the chorus are sung by Malakian, who mocks, \"I buy my crack, my smack, my bitch, right here in Hollywood\". The \"...right here in Hollywood\" verse has been changed in concerts depending where it is performed, such as Vancouver, L.A., Chicago. Some lines that stand out are: \"All research and successful drug policies show that treatment should be increased/ And law enforcement decreased/ while abolishing mandatory minimum sentences,\" \"Utilizing drugs to pay for secret wars around the world/ Drugs are now your global policy now you police the globe... drug money is used to rig elections/ And train brutal corporate sponsored dictators/ Around the world\" \"Minor drug offenders fill your prisons/You don't even flinch...\"\n\nThis is one of the few songs on \"Toxicity\" to utilize Serj's infamous death grunt.\n\nThere was a CD with the demo version of the song released by System of a Down called Beno's Copy.\n\nThe song was featured in the Visions: All Areas Volume 19, Underskin Promo, Kerrang!

The song was first premiered by the famous Los Angeles, California radio station KROQ on May 23, 2005 and was released to alternative and rock radio stations on July 12 of the same year.\n\nThe song is sometimes compared to one of System of a Down's other songs \"Aerials,\" which also deals with the nature of life in the lyrics. Both are primarily sung by Serj but seem to have Daron as back-up in the chorus. Music similarities are not as easy to spot.

The lyrics, are about drug (such as heroin) abuse and its dangers. Just like having a tape worm, you keep feeding this addiction without ever being \"nourished\". The more you feed it the bigger it gets and the less you get from it. After the second chorus, there is a bass riff that leads into bridge, where Malakian the guitarist sings \"I'm sitting in my room with a needle in my hand. Just waiting for the tomb of some old dying man\", and later Tankian joins and leads into the last chorus, with his famous death growl.\nThe band has denied ever using drugs.\nAt concerts, the band makes the bridge a total funk style. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/System+of+a+Down/_/Needles\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Twista knows this better than most.The pioneering platinum rapper put Chicago on the rap map and made the double-time rap style a rap staple. Despite selling millions of albums and popularizing a delivery incorporated by everyone from Jay-Z to Eminem, the Windy City rapper remains largely unheralded by the uninformed. That\u2019s why he\u2019s named his new album The Dark Horse. \u201cKnowing my personality, that I\u2019m laid-back and low-key and there\u2019s not a lot of rah-rah, I\u2019m usually the one that people least expect to stand out,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not just talking about being on a track. I\u2019m talking about when I\u2019m in a room with the big dogs. I\u2019m usually the last person expected to do something. My name also gets left off the Top MCs list, so I took on the mentality of where feel like I\u2019m looked at as a dark horse in the industry. I like to just come out unexpectedly and shine on them.\u201dTwista does just that on The Dark Horse selections \u201cFor Me And You\u201d and \u201cScale The Wall.\u201d Produced by longtime sonic partner The Legendary Traxster (Do Or Die, Mariah Carey), these two songs add new installments to the pair\u2019s classic collaborations. \u201cI think those two songs in particular are going to make people feel like, \u2018Damn, this boy ain\u2019t lost a step. This sounds just like \u2018Adrenaline Rush\u2019 or \u2018Death Before Dishonor\u2019 Twista,\u2019\u201d Twista explains. \u201cThe people that want to hear that dark, bass-hitting Twistasound with me snapping, I\u2019m definitely going to satisfy them.\u201dThe same can be said for the Tech N9ne collaboration \u201cPsycho.\u201d Although the pair has worked together over the years, this song showcases a new, dramatic dimension to their material. \u201cIt\u2019s done in the way that I envisioned a song that Tech N9ne and I would do,\u201d Twista says. \u201cSometimes we\u2019ve done songs where I haven\u2019t really hit that style that I want to hit with him. There\u2019s a certain type of vibe that I wanted to hit. By me being the one that picked the beat and being able to tell him how I want to go in on it, it\u2019s exactly how I wanted a Tech N9ne and Twista song to sound. We\u2019re going in so hard and in such a way that people can see that we\u2019re pretty much the top ones doing it.\u201dTwista shifts gears on \u201cThrowin My Money.\u201d The future strip club anthem features Twista freaking fast and slow flows and sharing the mic with fellow Chi-Town musical titan R. Kelly. \u201cIt\u2019s got that Twista swing to it,\u201d Twista says. \u201cWhen I let R. Kelly hear the song, he thought it was a monster once he heard the hook and the vibe of the song. When I heard the finished product, I was like, \u2018We\u2019ve got to throw this out there.\u2019 Songwise and vibewise, I felt like it\u2019s a good song and people will rock to it.\u201dThen there\u2019s \u201cNext To You\u201d with crooner Jeremih. The soulful selection features Twista adopting a suave approach and delivering his raps in a distinctive way. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like a normal song,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has a tripped out cadence to it to where I\u2019m doing the Twista style, but it\u2019s not in the average way where everybody can bite it like they usually do.\u201d Elsewhere, pays homage to rap elder statesmen Run-DMC with the stylish \u201ca.d.i.d.a.s.\u201d He got the idea for the song when he and his friends were vibing and listening to beats. \u201cIt put me in a Run-DMC mindstate,\u201d Twista says. \u201cThat\u2019s what made me be like, \u2018Let me go ahead and do this.\u2019\u201dFrom the first time Twista rapped, people wanted to hear him do this. He broke through in the early 1990s as Tung Twista, earning acclaim as the fastest rapper in the world, even holding the Guinness World Record title for the distinction. But it would take a while for people to catch up to Twista\u2019s trailblazing rap abilities. When he reemerged in 1996 with Do Or Die on the landmark \u201cPo Pimp\u201d single, the rechristened Twista amazed fans and critics alike with his remarkably smooth rapid-fire raps. Twista then became a rap king with the release of Adrenaline Rush, his 1997 album. The collection\u2019s mind-bending vocal performances, terrific storytelling and supreme lyricism placed Twista among rap\u2019s premier artists.\u201cI think I helped offer in a new vibe, a new style to what we already had in hip-hop and rap music,\u201d he explains. \u201cEven though you had a few people dabbling in it, the level that I took the double time style to helped contribute to there being another style that you could do your music.\u201d Twista became even more popular in 2003 and 2004 when he teamed with fellow Chicagoan Kanye West and Jamie Foxx for the smash single \u201cSlow Jamz.\u201d Twista\u2019s 2004 album, Kamikaze, earned him his first platinum plaque. Since then, Twista has remained one of rap\u2019s premier practitioners and in-demand collaborators. He\u2019s appeared on albums from Mariah Carey, Pitbull and Jay-Z, among others, and released a string of acclaimed albums and mixtapes. But for Twista, it all comes down to the music. It\u2019s the reason he\u2019s remained one of rap\u2019s top talents for two decades. \u201cIt\u2019s the love of the music,\u201d he says. \u201cI do other things and I have other business ventures that I do, but my love is really with the music. I keep doing it and staying in it because I love music. I still get excited every time I hear a beat or think of a different flow.\u201dNow with The Dark Horse, Twista brings new life into his music by recreating his classic style and building upon it, too. \u201cI try not to break what I know is already cool or what people want from me,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople want to just hear that fierce Twista stuff that they know and love. The main thing I\u2019m doing with this album is staying true to what people know that I do.\u201d ZION I Website Soundcloud With more than two-dozen albums, mixtapes, EP\u2019s and vibrant collaborations, the Oakland based MC/Producer Zion I (a.k.a. Zumbi) is in the top echelon, as far as\u00a0conscious party-rocking hip-hop. After years of collaboration with producer Amp Live and DJ K-Genius and other notables, the Oakland-based rapper/ songwriter has evolved as an independent touring artist.\u00a0His progressive stay-true-to-the-core lyricism is uniquely embraced across all genres of music and his collaborations, with some of the greatest in the industry, is an evolutionary norm for Zion I. From the reggae-rock giants Rebelution, to hip-hop nostalgia Too Short, along with Devin The Dude and The Roots MC, Black Thought, to EDM DJ extraordinaire, Bassnectar, heavy hitting rockers Linkin Park and alternative rock/reggae-rapper Matisyahu, Zion I continues\u2019 to impress with soulful goods.As an MC, Zion I emulates the purest form of hip-hop, bringing forth a socially conscious lyrical deliverance and high energy party-rockin\u2019 live show that captivates his audience, making him a festival fan-favorite from coast to coast. The international touring artist has performed at some of the most reputable music festivals across the globe. Some of the more notable festivals include: Coachella, Rock the Bells, Treasure Island Music Fest, Lightning In A Bottle, Outside Lands, California Roots Music and Arts Festival, Hangout Music Festival, Splash Fest (Germany), HipHop Kemp (Czech Republic), Rifflandia (British Columbia), Sonic Bloom, Paid Dues, Snow Globe and most recently the urban lifestyle music and arts festival, Bay Area Vibez with Bassnectar, Nas and Damian Marley. Zion I toured the summer 2016 with Slightly Stoopid, SOJA, The Grouch and Eligh on The Return Of The Redeye tour.Some of the many other artists Zion I has performed with include, Kendrick Lamar, Wu-Tang, Pretty Lights, E-40, The Roots, Soja, The Game, Flying Lotus, Matisyahu, Griz, Emancipator, Damian \u201cJr. Gong\u201d Marley, Collie Buddz and Common.Zion I is a gestalt of lived geographic experience. Coming from Philadelphia, he also lived in Cincinnati, Rhode Island, Houston and Atlanta \u2013 although, he views Oakland, his current residence of nineteen years as his home. \u201cIt is the place where my music first grew. I have always loved the diversity and culture of rebellion that is in the heart of Oakland,\u201d said Zion I. There\u2019s every shade of color here. When people see injustice, there is a collective activation that takes place and we take to the streets to fire back at the system. The history of the Black Panthers is still alive in the hearts of many. I live and breathe this energy of this community, with its turbulent rise and fall of the struggle to live with dignity. I draw tremendous inspiration in my lyrics from the town.\u201d\u201cI hope to be an example for the next generation; showing that you can live out your\u00a0dreams and pursue your goals with passion and exuberance,\u201d said Zion I.Zion I released his new full-length fifteen-song album, The Labyrinth in October, 2016. He describes the record as melodic and bass heavy. \u201cIt was cool being able to hit the people with some new vibes and give them a current window into my world. I&#39;ve also got the new ZGE - Zion I, Grouch, and Eligh record on deck, which will drop in early 2017. I\u2019m also working on a dope project with Locksmith, which is a more lyrically driven record with classic sample-driven production. Locksmith is one of the most skilled MC&#39;s on the west coast, so this project is for true fans of lyricism,\u201d says ZumbiCatalog highlights include The Grouch-joined linguistic clinic \u201cSilly Puddy,\u201d early K.Flay standout appearance on the Electro-driven \u201cCoastin\u2019,\u201d and the gritty turf-talk of \u201cDon\u2019t Lose Ya Head\u201d alongside Too Short. GIFT OF GAB Website The Gift of Gab\u00a0is most well known as MC, and one-half, of the rap duo\u00a0Blackalicious. Along with producer/DJ\u00a0Chief Xcel, the two have sold over half a million records worldwide, toured extensively across the globe and have had their music licensed by some of the most well-known brands on theplanet.Born Tim Parker, Gift of Gab spent his childhood growing up in Southern California\u2019s San Fernando Valley but attended high school in Sacramento. It was there in 1987 that he first met Chief Xcel (born Xavier Mosley) and the two joined forces. However it wasn\u2019t until 1991 that Blackalicious was officially formed at UC Davis College where the two connected with\u00a0DJ Shadow, MC\u2019s\u00a0Lateef the Truthspeaker\u00a0&\u00a0Lyrics Born\u00a0and author\u00a0Jeff Chang. The group formed a collective they dubbed\u00a0SoleSides\u00a0and went on torelease their own records in the mid to late 90\u2019s.Blackalicious\u2019 very first single, \u201cSwan Lake\u201d was released in 1994 with many more to follow, establishing themselves as a major force in the West Coast Hip-Hop scene and resulting in extensive touring taking them all over the United States and Europe.Work on a full-length album began in earnest during which time SoleSides reconfigured itself in to the seminal record label and collective,\u00a0Quannum Projects.In 1999 Blackalicious released the\u00a0A2G\u00a0EP which featured the hit \u201cAlphabet Aerobics\u201d, solidifying the duo as a force to be reckoned with and establishing The Gift of Gab as one of the most talented MCs in the game.Blackalicious\u2019 first full length album titled\u00a0Nia\u00a0was released in 2000 with their second album\u00a0Blazing Arrow\u00a0following in 2002. Both albums became a phenomenon and are still considered as two of the most important and influential Underground Hip-Hop records of all time.The group\u2019s third album,\u00a0The Craft\u00a0was released in 2005 to critical acclaim. Soon after the group took a hiatus until recently, releasing their fourth album,\u00a0Imani Vol. 1\u00a0in late 2015.In addition to Blackalicious, Gift of Gab has had a long and prolific solo career that began with his 2004 album,\u00a04th Dimensional Rocketships Going Up, produced by\u00a0Vitamin D\u00a0and\u00a0Jake One.With Blackalicious on hiatus after\u00a0The Craft, Gab joined up with fellow Quannum collaborator\u00a0Lateef the Truthspeaker\u00a0and Bay Area producer\u00a0Headnodic\u00a0(Crown City Rockers) to create\u00a0The Mighty Underdogs.The trio released an EP in 2007 (The Prelude) followed by a full-length record in 2008 titled\u00a0Droppin\u2019 Science Fiction.The following year Gab released his next solo project titled\u00a0Escape 2 Mars, produced by\u00a0DNAE Beats. The album featured the track \u201cEl Gifto Magnifico\u201d, creating another moniker for the famed MC.In 2012 Gab released his third solo record titled\u00a0The Next Logical Progression, produced by\u00a0G Koop. The album featured many guest artists including\u00a0Martin Luther,\u00a0Zion I,\u00a0George Clinton\u00a0as well as hisQuannum brothers\u00a0Lyrics Born\u00a0and\u00a0Lateef the Truthspeaker.It was also in 2012 when Gab suffered kidney failure due to Type 1 diabetes just as Blackalicious was getting back in the studio to start working on new material. Unsure of what would happen Gab opted to stay positive and creative and used the downtime to write.Currently on regular dialysis treatments as he waits for a new kidney, Gab has maintained a positive outlook through the experience and continues to write more than he ever has before. This has led to not only the new Blackalicious record, but also material for a new solo EP and album.The EP titled\u00a0Rejoice! Rappers are Rapping Again\u00a0is available exclusively at Gift of Gab&#39;s Patreon page and has set the stage for a new full-length solo record due in 2018.

Woodberry Down, particularly in terms of housing and water systems, has since played an important part in the development of\u00a0London. It was hence developed as a home to the wealthy laid out in the late 1860\u2019s with large detached villas and regarded as a particularly select suburb. By the early 20th century this had become \u201cthe posh end of Stoke Newington\u201d and home to several wealthy Jewish families and Albert Chevalier, the music hall artiste. However, with the increasing suburbanisation of the area, many of the original residents were replaced by poorer families and social decline continued until the early 20th century when the area was predominantly dominated by the working classes with most houses, all in decay, containing four or five families each. In 1934, the London County Council compulsorily purchased all of Woodberry Down and the construction of a \u2018utopian estate of the future\u2019 began after the Second World War in 1949. The project was completed in 1962 with 57 blocks of flats erected over 64 acres of land.\u00a0 Initially, the enormous estate offered greatly improved living conditions, but, like other utopian schemes of a similar nature, Woodberry Down became a flawed place in which to live. By the late 1980s, many of the flats were in a poor state of repair with many more either squatted or empty and boarded up. The area is now in the midst of another massive regeneration project which has conjured much controversy and debate. In the meantime and in contrast, the development of the reservoirs remained largely undisturbed, although not without their fair share of controversy, and both the East and West Reservoirs and their associated filter-beds served as operational units until 1992. The former, in fact, still operates as a raw water store for the\u00a0New River\u00a0and it remains an essential part of\u00a0London\u2019s water supply. Remaining closed to the public throughout its nearly 200 year history, the East Reservoir was designated as a Site of Metropolitan Importance was recently transformed into Woodberry Wetlands. The nature reserve was developed by London Wildlife Trust with an aim protect and enhance the reserve\u2019s biodiversity interests and create free public access to the reservoir for the public to enjoy and learn about the resident wildlife and the importance of the site\u2019s heritage. And, in May 2016, Woodberry Wetlands opened to the public for the first time. There are several Grade II listed buildings constructed in the early 19th centre of particular interest still standing on the site. Along with the pumping station and filtration plant, built on the West Reservoir, now known now as \u2018The Castle\u2019 for its disguise\u00a0as a medieval fortress built in the Scottish Baronial manner, the Ivy Gate Sluice House and the Coal House represent working water works structures of the time.\u00a0 The Coal House has been subject to major renovation works to rescue it from the Heritage At Risk Register and now operates as a caf\u00e9 and visitor centre. If you love\u00a0London\u00a0heritage, architecture, nature & wildlife or simply walking in a beautiful waterside setting, this is a riveting tour not to be missed. The stories told by the surrounding developments alone, make the area an absolutely fascinating place to visit. This event is suitable for ages 14+ Please note: No dogs are allowed at Woodberry Wetlands except guide dogs for the sight impaired.

All four members are of Armenian descent, and are widely known for their outspoken views expressed in many of their songs confronting the Armenian Genocide of 1915 by the Ottoman Empire and the ongoing War on Terror by the US government. The band consists of Serj Tankian (vocals), Daron Malakian (vocals, guitar), Shavo Odadjian (bass, vocals) and John Dolmayan (drums).\nSystem of a Down has achieved commercial success with five albums, and many singles such as their breakout hit \"Chop Suey!\", \"Toxicity\", \"Aerials\", \"B.Y.O.B.\", \"Question!\", \"Hypnotize\" and \"Lonely Day\". Their works have earned them one Grammy Award amongst three nominations.\n\nThe band has been influenced by heavy metal, punk rock and Armenian folk.\n\nSystem of a Down went on hiatus in 2006, with Serj Tankian pursuing a solo career and Daron Malakian and John Dolmayan forming Scars on Broadway. Shavo joined together with RZA from the Wu-Tang clan to form Hip-Hop group Achozen. \n\nSystem of a Down is a part of the Axis of Justice, a non-profit organization formed by band member Serj Tankian (along with Tom Morello of Rage Against The Machine), dedicated to bringing together musicians, music fans, and grassroots political organizations to fight for social justice.\n\nSoil (1993\u20131995)\nThe roots of System of a Down lie in the band Soil (not to be confused with the current band SOiL), a group from Los Angeles that included Serj Tankian on vocals/keyboard, and Daron Malakian on vocals/guitar, as well as Dave Hakopyan (Bassist for Mt. Helium) on bass and Domingo Laranio (Local Hawaii Drummer) on drums. Shavo Odadjian joined Soil near their end as a guitarist. After three years, only one live show, and one jam session recording, the band split up.\n\nIn the beginning (1995\u20131997)\nAfter Soil split up, Serj and Daron formed a new band, System of a Down, based on a poem that Daron wrote. The poem's title was \"Victims of the Down\", but Shavo Odadjian, who was originally the band's manager and promoter, didn't like the word and thought the word \"System\" sounded better. Ever since Shavo joined as bassist, managerial duties have been undertaken by the Velvet Hammer Music and Management Group and founder David \"Beno\" Benveniste. The band then found a drummer, Andy Khachaturian. System of a Down quickly made what is known as their early Untitled 1995 Demo Tape, which had very early recordings of \"Mr. Jack\" (called \"PIG\"), along with songs called \"Flake\", \"Toast\" and an early recording of \"The Metro\", a cover of the Berlin song of the same name. It is rumored that there are other tapes made, which contain early recordings of \"Friik\", \"36\" (called \".36\"), and \"Roulette\". Two other songs, \"X\" (called \"Multiply\") and \"Honey\" were live demos at the time and were played at very early shows. After this, the band recorded Demo Tape 1, which had early versions of \"Sugar\", \"Suite-Pee\", and \"P.L.U.C.K.\", as well as \"Dam.\" Demo Tape 2 was released in 1996 and had a rough demo of the song \"Soil\" as well as the most known unreleased tracks such as \"Honey\" and \"Temper.\" At the beginning of 1997, SOAD recorded their final publicly-released demo tape, Demo Tape 3, which had rough versions of \"Peephole\", \"War?\", and \"Know.\" In mid 1997, Ontronik Khachaturian left the band due to a hand injury. Soon after playing at the Whisky-A-Go-Go and Viper Room with new drummer John Dolmayan, producer Rick Rubin caught the band's attention and told them to keep in touch with him. Showing great interest, they recorded Demo Tape 4 near the end of that year. This demo, however, was made only to be sent to record companies. The tape was not released to the public until years later when it was leaked onto the Internet. After Rick helped them get signed onto American/Columbia Records, SOAD began to record in his studio. In 1997 SOAD won the Best Signed Band award from the Rock City Awards. Prior to 1998, SOAD's live shows were called \"The Dark Red Experience\".\n\nDebut album (1998\u20132000)\nIn the summer of 1998, System of a Down released their debut album, System of a Down. They enjoyed moderate success with their first single \"Sugar\" becoming a radio favorite, followed by the single \"Spiders\". After the release of the album, System of a Down toured extensively, opening for Slayer before making their way to the second stage of Ozzfest. Following Ozzfest, they toured with Fear Factory and Incubus before headlining the Sno-Core tour with Puya, Mr. Bungle, The Cat and Incubus providing support. System was scheduled to play the 1999 Family Values Tour, but were kicked off by Fred Durst over his inability to sign the band Taproot. Fred Durst has since admitted that he was a \"complete wanker\" in relation to this \"oversight\". The band have yet to comment on Durst's involvement or commentary. In 2000, the group contributed their cover of the Black Sabbath song \"Snowblind\" to the Sabbath tribute album Nativity in Black 2.\n\nToxicity, Steal This Album! (2001\u20132003)\nThe group's big break arrived when their second album Toxicity debuted at #1 on the American and Canadian charts, eventually achieving multi-platinum certification. The album has since sold 6 million copies worldwide. It was still on top in America on the week of the September 11, 2001 attacks and the political environment caused by the attacks added to the controversy surrounding their hit single \"Chop Suey!\" causing it to be taken off the radio as it contained politically sensitive lyrics at the time such as \"(I don't think you) trust in my self-righteous suicide.\" Regardless, the video gained constant play on MTV as did the second single, \"Toxicity\". Even with the controversy surrounding \"Chop Suey!\" which earned a Grammy nomination, System of a Down still received constant airplay in the United States throughout late 2001 and 2002 with \"Toxicity \" and \"Aerials\". In May 2006, VH1 listed Toxicity in the #14 slot in the 40 Greatest Metal Songs.\n\nIn 2001, the band went on tour with Slipknot in the United States and Mexico. After seeing the success of the tour, System and Slipknot went on a Pledge of Allegiance Tour with Rammstein in 2002. In late 2001, a few unreleased tracks made their way onto the Internet. The group released a statement that the tracks were unfinished material. Soon after, the band released the final versions of the songs, which were recorded at the same time, but hadn't been used for Toxicity. The result was Steal This Album!, released in November 2002. Steal This Album! resembled a burnable CD that was marked with a felt-tip marker. 50,000 special copies of the album with different CD designs were also released, each designed by a different member of the band. The name of the album is a reference to Abbie Hoffman's counter-culture book, Steal This Book and as a message to those who stole the songs and released them on the Internet. \"Steal This Album was the lowest rated album that we had ever made\" Dolmayan said in an interview. The song \"Innervision\" was released as a promo single and received constant airplay on alternative radio. A video for \"Boom!\" was filmed with director Michael Moore as a protest against the War in Iraq.\n\nMezmerize / Hypnotize (2004\u20132005)\nFrom 2004 to 2005, the group produced a double album, Mezmerize/Hypnotize with the two parts released six months apart. The first album, Mezmerize, was released on May 17, 2005, to favorable reviews by critics. It debuted at #1 in the United States, Canada, Australia and all around the world, making it System of a Down's second #1 album. First week sales rocketed to over 800,000 copies worldwide. The Grammy Award-winning single \"B.Y.O.B.\", which questions the integrity of war, worked its way up the Billboard Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts. The next single, \"Question!\" was released with Shavo Odadjian co-directing the music video. Following the release of Mezmerize, the band toured extensively throughout the United States and Canada with The Mars Volta and Bad Acid Trip supporting.\n\nThe second part of the double album, Hypnotize, was released on November 22, 2005. Like Mezmerize, it debuted at #1 in the US, making System of a Down, along with the Beatles, Guns 'N Roses, and rappers 2Pac and DMX, the only artists to ever have two studio albums debut at #1 in the same year.\n\nIn February 2006, the band won the Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance for \"B.Y.O.B.\", beating out other established artists such as Nine Inch Nails and Robert Plant. Their second single off the Hypnotize album, \"Lonely Day\" was released in March in the United States. System of a Down released \"Kill Rock 'N Roll\" and \"Vicinity of Obscenity\" as their next promo singles. The band headlined Ozzfest 2006 in cities where tour founder Ozzy Osbourne opted not to appear or wasn't playing on the main stage. These shows turned out to be the bands last performances together to date.\n\nHiatus and Future (2006\u2013present)\nIn May 2006, the band announced they were going on hiatus. Daron Malakian has confirmed the break will probably last a few years, but it was Shavo who in an interview with Guitar magazine said it will last at least 3 years, but insists that the band would not be splitting up. He told MTV, \"We're not breaking up. If that was the case, we wouldn't be doing this Ozzfest. We're going to take a very long break after Ozzfest and do our own things. We've done System for over ten years, and I think it's healthy to take a rest.\"\n\nDuring their performance in Houston, Texas, Malakian also took a moment to say, \"There's been a lot of rumors about us breaking up. Well, don't listen to them. Us four right here, we will always be System of a Down!\" However, Malakian announced he was forming a band called Scars on Broadway, which has since been joined by Dolmayan, and will work on its debut album during autumn. Odadjian will be working on a project with RZA of Wu-Tang Clan named Achozen as well as his UrSession website/record label. Tankian plans to keep recording as a solo artist/producer with his first single being Empty Walls off his first album Elect the Dead which was released on October 23, 2007, while Dolmayan, on top of Scars on Broadway, plans to open a comic book store online, which should be up online in November 2007.\n\nSystem of a Down's final performance before their hiatus took place on August 13, 2006 in West Palm Beach, Florida, as part of the 2006 Ozzfest Festival. \"Tonight will be the last show we play for a long time together\", Malakian told the crowd during Sunday's last performance. \"We'll be back. We just don't know when.\" It was stated by Sharon Osbourne that System of a Down was paid \"about $325,000 a show.\"\n\nSystem of a Down's songs were used in the 2006 film \"Screamers\" by Carla Garapedian. \"Screamers\" debuted in theaters in large city markets such as New York City, Detroit, Washington D.C., San Francisco, Fresno, Providence, and Boston. An earlier engagement started exclusively in Los Angeles on [December 8], 2006.\n\nSystem of a Down was honored at the USC v. Cal game at the Los Angeles Coliseum in Los Angeles, CA in 2006. The Spirit of Troy also known as the Trojan Marching Band performed three System of a Down songs. The marching band was honored to play \"Toxicity\", \"Sugar\", and Hypnotize\" along with John Dolmayan and Shavo Odadjian.\n\nTankian recently said that he has wanted to work on his \"solo record for years\". As for the future of the band, he said that he does not know whether System of a Down is over or not. He also stated that \"maybe in a few years\" the band would \"want to make another album. It's impossible to tell right now. It'll be later down the line; then we'll be able to tell what might happen.\"\n\nBassist Shavo Odadjian was recently revealed to be directing the first video for the comeback of the hardcore punk band, Bad Brains.\n\nFor the 2007 Grammys, System of a Down was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance for \"Lonely Day\", but lost to Wolfmother and their song \"Woman\".\n\nShavo Odadjian recently told Launch Radio Networks that System of a Down is \"alive and well\".\n\u201cWe're just not working together right now. We kind of like split up at first, but you know, we're brothers, man, we'll take bullets for each other. So it's like, you kind of miss each other after a while and you, one guy makes the first move, then another starts making phone calls....this is a juggernaut, man. System of a Down is my lifeline. It'll never go away. We could not make a record for 10 years \u2014 that's not gonna happen, but I'm just saying we could \u2014 and we'll come back strong.\u201d\n\nFuture and possible Reunion\nWhen asked in February 2008 if a reunion was planned any time in the future, Daron Malakian had admitted that System of a Down may never get back together again. He had this to say: \u201cThere's no talk of System doing anything. We're not planning on doing anything. If anyone's holding their breath for a System record, they're going to turn blue and pass out. It's a long ways away, if it ever even happens. We don't even talk about it - none of us. This (Scars on Broadway) is my band right now.\u201d\n\nOn September 14, 2007 an American TV interview video with Shavo Odadjian was posted online, and subsequently embedded on the MySpace profile of his current working band, Achozen. He commented on System of a Down's status and future, saying: \u201cWe're taking a break. It got to a point where we we're kinda...not implode but like, y'know, I saw something and [inaudible]... Thirteen years of non stop y'know, so- and we all have things we wanna do... Everyone and their mother wants to say that we are breaking up, that we broke up. It's like, everyone talks to me 'Oh you guys broke up' no we didn't break up, why d'ya want us to brea- you want us to break up, we'll break up!\u201d\n\nIn a September 13, 2007 interview, frontman Serj Tankian offered his take on the band's future by saying: \"It's very simple. System of a Down, we've been a band for 11 years, or 12 years. We've put out five records, we're all friends. We're still friends. And we decided to take time to pursue our own artistic and personal goals. And unlike a company like Nabisco that puts out crackers every year, or cookies every year, we're artists, we're friends. So we don't have to necessarily do things the same way every year. So we took time to do our own things and we left the door open. We're all friends. If we ever want to get together and speak to the world as System of a Down, then we will. If not, then we'll...the door is open.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if there could be a possible reunion one day, he responded by saying: \"It's very possible\".\n\nIn an April 2008 interview with Kerrang magazine, guitarist Daron Malakian and drummer John Dolmayan (who have recently formed a side project known as Scars on Broadway) gave their takes on the bands future. When told that many people are going to wonder what the future of the band is, Malakian responded by stating that: \"We'll all know when the time is right\". Dolmayan added: \"It'll just happen\". Malakian went on to say: \u201cYeah. It'll feel good and happen. I can respect this situation (System's hiatus) more than I can respect the situation where two people are like, 'The lead singer fucked my girlfriend!' and that kind of bullshit. Nah, man. The lead singer is a special person to me and I am to him. And that's how we ended off. Same with Shavo, same with John. And it will always be. It was a big part of my life. We were onstage together for a long time, man. We went through shit as a band and friends -- we slept in RVs together!\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Tankian about Big Day Out 2009 (a show which involved playing his Elect the Dead album live with the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra, and a few songs from his then-upcoming second studio album) Tankian stated, \"Every few months I am honored to hear interesting rumors about whether the band is going to tour or break up permanently. I find them all to be very entertaining.\"\n\nOn October 31, 2009, Odadjian threw a Halloween party at the Roxy during which he, Malakian, and Dolmayan performed \"Suite-Pee\" (off System of a Down), Scars on Broadway's \"They Say,\" and an unknown song.  This performance was followed by another partial reunion of the band on November 20, 2009, at the Avalon in Hollywood during which Malakian, Dolmayan, and Odadjian played \"Aerials\" and \"Toxicity.\"\n\nReunion (2011)\nOn Monday, November 29th, 2010, System of a Down announced on their website that they would reform for a string of large European festival dates in June 2011.  Among the announced tour dates included UK's Download Festival, Switzerland's Greenfield Festival, Germany's Rock am Ring/Rock im Park and Sweden's Metaltown festivals. In their reunion statement posted on their website, the band was unclear as to the extent of their reformation. It read, \"We have no master plan of sorts -- we are playing these shows simply because we want to play together again as a band and for you, our amazing fans.\"\n\nFrom late February to early March 2012, they headlined five dates at Soundwave festival. This was the band's first visit to Australia since 2005. The band have continued playing around the world. On August 11 and 12, 2012, they played the Heavy MTL and Heavy T.O. music festivals in Montreal and Toronto, respectively. On February 4, 2013, it was announced that System of a Down would play the UK's Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2013, among other festivals and venues. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/System+of+a+Down\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

She told The Sunday Times: \"It's about giving as good as you get.\"\nFlorence explained the song's meaning on her Myspace:\n\"Kiss with a Fist\" is NOT a song about domestic violence. It is about two people pushing each other to psychological extremes because they are fighting but they still love each other. The song is not about one person being attacked, or any actual physical violence, there are no victims in this song. Sometimes the love two people have for each other is a destructive force. But they can't have it any other way, because it's what holds them together, they enjoy the drama and pushing each other's buttons. The only way to express these extreme emotions is with extreme imagery, all of which is fantasism and nothing in the song is based on reality. Leona Lewis's \"Bleeding Love\" isn't actually about her bleeding and this song isn't actually about punching someone in the mouth.\n\nThe song was first recorded as \"Happy Slap\" by Florence's earlier band, Ashok. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Florence+%252B+the+Machine/_/Kiss+with+a+Fist\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The promising quartet built up a strong, impassioned grassroots following that helped propel it to a pair of back-to-back wins in KTCLs benchmark promotions, the annual Big Gig this past summer and Hometown for the Holidays- not to mention multiple sold-out headlining shows of their own. Hard to believe that a little more than a year ago this foursome (Emma Cole, Joshua Hester, Seth Beamer, and Caleb Thoemke) was an auspicious yet aspiring act playing unassuming opening slots on weeknights. The outfit quickly won fans over with a smart brand of guitar-driven pop, which has plenty in common with acts like Local Natives, Echosmith, and Florence and the Machine. Cleary, the act found its way.The songs are instantly memorable as much for their melodies as for their meaning -- both of which are equally as integral to the impact of the song, if you ask Hester. &quot;I&#39;ve always thought lyrics find their validation through melody, he says. You can sing the simplest line but if a melody has conviction, then it works better than the most poetic paragraph you can write.&quot;Talk about seeing the forest for the trees.- Dave Herrera, Former Westword Music Editor", "title": "Wildermiss", "url": "http://coloradosprings.eventful.com/events/wildermiss-/E0-001-110505235-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "The Black Sheep", "date": "2018-02-16 19:00:00"}, {"city": "Richmond", "description": " This event is all ages <br>Big Mama Shakes<br><br>Big Mama Shakes<br> At its core: Big Mama Shakes is synonymous with rock and roll. I don&#39;t mean that in the pretentious &quot;I&#39;m an artistic genius&quot; kind of way that John Lennon or Robbie Robertson might have; I mean it in the most painfully fun and raucously raw way one can experience rock and roll.<br><br> Kings of Leon:<br> Initially embraced as &quot;the Southern Strokes&quot; for their resurrection and reinvention of Dixie-styled rock & roll, Kings of Leon steadily morphed into an experimental rock outfit during the 2000s. The Tennessee-bred quartet debuted in 2003 with the Holy Roller Novocaine EP, whose blend of raw, unpolished boogie rock was further explored on their debut full-length, Youth & Young Manhood. Such revivalist music was matched by a similarly revivalist appearance -- including long hair, mustaches, and tight-fitting denim -- and Kings of Leon experienced immediate popularity in the U.K. (where they would later enjoy platinum album sales, despite an initially lukewarm reception at home). As the band explored different sonic textures with subsequent releases, most notably on 2007&#39;s Because of the Times and 2008&#39;s Only by the Night, those tenuous links to the Strokes were finally dissolved. <br> Comprised of three Followill brothers -- Caleb (guitar), Nathan (drums), and Jared (bass) -- as well as first cousin Matthew Followill (guitar), Kings of Leon formed in 2000. The Followill siblings had spent their youth traveling across America&#39;s heartland with their evangelist father, decamping at Pentecostal churches and tent revivals for several days at a time before moving onward. When their father resigned from the church and divorced his wife in 1997, the boys relocated to Nashville and embraced the rock music (not to mention the accompanying lifestyle) they&#39;d previously been denied. Cousin Matthew was added to the lineup, and a Southern garage rock sound quickly emerged. RCA took note, signing the band in 2001 and facilitating a partnership with Nashville-based producer Angelo Petraglia, who furthered the band&#39;s rock & roll education and co-wrote the material for 2003&#39;s Holy Roller Novocaine EP.<br><br> Tours across North America and the U.K. coincided with the release of the band&#39;s full-length debut, Youth & Young Manhood, that same summer. Thanks to the popular single &quot;Molly&#39;s Chambers,&quot; the album found moderate success in the U.K. However, it was their sophomore effort, 2004&#39;s Aha Shake Heartbreak, that made them European stars, with three songs cracking the U.K. charts. The album saw an American release in February 2005, and Kings of Leon toured the country alongside U2 before retreating to work on their third effort. The darker, expansive Because of the Timesfollowed in 2007. Featuring production from Ethan Johns (who had helmed the band&#39;s previous releases as well), the album proved to be the band&#39;s biggest release to date, debuting at number 25 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and topping the album charts in the U.K., Ireland, and New Zealand. <br> Kings of Leon returned one year later with Only by the Night, a colossally popular album whose lead single, &quot;Sex on Fire,&quot; gave the band its first number one hit in the U.K. The album itself fared similarly well, topping the U.K. charts upon its release and debuting at number four in America. It eventually gained platinum status in eight countries, including America, and its success allowed the band to tour heavily throughout much of 2008 and 2009. Live at the O2 was released in late 2009, capturing one of the band&#39;s midsummer performances in London. Kings of Leon briefly holed up in Manhattan&#39;s Avatar Studios to work on a fifth record, but they returned to the road during the summer of 2010, taking the opportunity to play some of their new material in concert. By the time the tour wrapped up in September, the group&#39;s newest single, &quot;Radioactive,&quot; had already been released. The accompanying album, Come Around Sundown, followed in October. The record was a worldwide hit and reached number one in 15 countries, including the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Australia. <br><br> Later that year they embarked on a marathon tour; however, a disastrous show in Texas resulted in frontman Caleb walking off the stage without returning for the end of the set. After this incident, the brothers decided to undertake a self-imposed hiatus in 2011 and canceled the rest of the tour while the band attempted to reconcile their personal and group problems. In the time apart, bassist Jared released music with Mona frontman Nick Brownunder the moniker Smoke & Jackal, while Caleb found sobriety after moving to New York and the birth of his son. They returned to the band with a batch of new material and set to work on their sixth record, Mechanical Bull, which appeared in September of 2013. Buoyed by the single &quot;Supersoaker,&quot; the album reached number two on the Billboard 200 and garnered a nomination for Best Rock Album at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards. <br> Following the end of the band&#39;s 2014-2015 Mechanical Bull tour, Kings of Leon revealed they had already begun work on a follow-up. In 2016, they released their seventh studio album, WALLS. Produced in Los Angeles with Markus Dravs (Florence + the Machine, Arcade Fire, Mumford & Sons), the album featured the single &quot;Waste a Moment.&quot; - All Music", "title": "Big Mama Shakes -Minor Poet, Walkerton Brothers", "url": "http://richmond.eventful.com/events/big-mama-shakes-minor-poet-walkerton-brothers-/E0-001-109846169-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "The Broadberry", "date": "2018-01-20 20:00:00"}, {"city": "Lexington", "description": " with Tancred<br> Julien Bakers solo debut, Sprained Ankle, was one of the most widely acclaimed works of 2015. The album, recorded by an 18-year-old and her friend in only a few days, was a bleak yet hopeful, intimate document of staggering experiences and grace, centered entirely around Bakers voice, guitar, and unblinking honesty. Sprained Ankle appeared on year-end lists everywhere from NPR Music to The AV Club to New York Magazines Vulture.With Turn Out The Lights, the now 21-year-old Baker returns to a much bigger stage, but with the same core of breathtaking vulnerability and resilience. From its opening moments when her chiming, evocative melody is accompanied by swells of strings Turn Out The Lights throws open the doors to the world without sacrificing the intimacy that has become a hallmark of her songs. The album explores how people live and come to terms with their internal conflict, and the alternately shattering and redemptive ways these struggles play out in relationships. Baker casts an unflinching and accepting eye on the duality of and contradictions in the human experience, at times even finding humor and joy in the midst of suffering. She ultimately calls on her listeners to move beyond good and bad, or happy and sad, to embrace more complex truths.The album was recorded at the legendary Ardent Studios in her hometown of Memphis, TN, and mixed by Craig Silvey (The National, Florence & the Machine, Arcade Fire). This evolution from Sprained Ankles intentionally spare production allowed greater scope and freedom for Baker, who is still the albums sole writer and producer. Strings and woodwinds now shade the corners of her compositions, and Baker takes to piano rather than guitar on several tracks. In songs like the epic Claws In Your Back, these new textures push Bakers work to cinematic heights of intensity. As always, the real draw is her songwriting and lyricism. Turn Out The Lights is more expansive in sound and vision than Sprained Ankle and illustrates significant growth, yet the album retains the haunting delicacy of her heartbreakingly confessional style. Where her debut focused inward on Bakers life and aspects of her identity (female, queer, Christian), Turn Out The Lights reflects on not only her own experiences, but also the experiences of those closest to her. The result finds Baker narrating a deliberate meditation on how we each try to deal with our ever-shifting mental health, and the impact this can have on both ourselves and others. The album sets out to address how the process of coping with internal conflicts affects different relationships romantic, familial, and friendly. Baker turns outward to embrace the challenges of the human experience, weaving personal struggles together into one surprisingly hopeful chorus.The album is bookended by Appointments and Claws in Your Back, two songs that deal with the precarious balance between nihilism and realism. A lot of stuff happened in my life that was rapid change, and it felt like it could not get any worse, Baker says of Appointments. I was like, I have reached critical mass for this amoeba of sadness and it cannot possibly turn out all right. But for the sake of my continuing to exist, I have to believe that it will. The resulting song (I think if I ruin this, then I know I can live with it, Baker sings) cuts to the core of Bakers uniquely clear-eyed take on human suffering. She resists facile conclusions and never glamorizes the extremes she depicts; yet she continually holds out the possibility of joy and solidarity. On Claws In Your Back, she turns her own hard-won determination to thrive into a rallying cry for her friends (I think I can love the sickness you made. I take it all back, I change my mind. I wanted to stay).Even as Turn Out The Lights explores broken relationships (Sour Breath), the search for a cure that may not exist (Everything To Help You Sleep), and the impossibility of ever truly understanding each other (Shadowboxing), Baker continually returns to the possibility of joy. I dont believe in the fixing part, where what healing means is that you no longer get sad or experience grief or have panic attacks, Baker says. Happy is kind of a fleeting and transient emotion. It is not a destination that you can get to by exerting enough mental effort. I believe that joy is something that you can invite into your present circumstance. Whereas happiness seems to be this horizon thats eternally getting further from you, joy is something that you can inhabit. Its this call to joy even in moments of otherwise total darkness that makes her music a refuge for her fans. Turn Out The Lights is ultimately a healing experience, and its impossible not to feel Bakers unyielding compassion for the messy and beautiful human experience. When I talk about things in myself I find ugly and unlovable, they are the most effective tools for connecting with other people, for helping other people heal, she says. And that helps me heal.", "title": "Julien Baker", "url": "http://lexington.eventful.com/events/julien-baker-/E0-001-110505827-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "The Burl", "date": "2018-04-21 21:00:00"}, {"city": "Manchester", "description": " <strong>WE STILL BELIEVE IN LOVE</strong><br><p>Raising money for the We Love Manchester charity fund.

They are joined by Rob Spradling on drums/ percussion. A former middle school choir teacher in a suburb of Aurora, Colorado, Hong used to write songs during her lunch breaks and play them for her students. She would eventually realize her passion was in creating and performing and left the public teaching field behind. Beeble, a longtime friend, joined the project after several song-writing and recording sessions and a mutually found musical vision. With formal musical training in multiple genres under both of their belts, Hong and Beeble released the acoustic EP, Entropy in 2013 to positive reviews, leading to a featured song on a promotional spot for Showtime Network&#39;s The Affair, a featured song on VH1s Couples Therapy, a spot in The Denver Posts Underground Music Showcase, as well as opening slots for acclaimed national acts such as Copeland, San Fermin, Son Lux, and Caroline Smith. Most recently, Ivory Circle made KTCL&#39;s Hometown For the Holidays top 11 in 2014, for their song &quot;Faces and Colors.&quot; Hongs ability to translate personal experiences (like heartache, death, or exploration of faith) into relatable musical stories is accomplished with the help of Beeble in their full band arrangements. Spradling brings a unique technological element to Ivory Circle as a videographer and additional in-studio producer, and has designed and developed the light show programs for Ivory Circles live performances. Recognizing the relevance of maintaining a strong online and social media presence, Ivory Circle creates an intimate experience with their listeners around the world through their blog and social media outlets. Ivory Circle creates a sound as unique as it is precise, electrifying and passionate, complete with lush strings, harmonic layers, and pulsing drumbeats, interwoven between the piano and vocal lines that give them their trademark sound. The combination of their intricate compositions juxtaposed with Hongs vocal prowess make them comparable to notable musicians such as Florence+the Machine, Regina Spektor, and Kimbra. The first two EPs in their Triangle series, Equilateral and Isosceles are available on iTunes and Bandcamp.

Martin performed the song in Ocean's Eleven in an alternate arrangement featuring vibraphonist Red Norvo and his quartet.\n\nThe song has been recorded by many performers, including Robbie Williams, David Slater, Westlife, Ray Quinn and Hazell Dean. It also appeared in the soundtracks for Ocean's Thirteen, Goodfellas, and Vegas Vacation and was the opening theme for Blue Collar Comedy Tour: One for the Road. It was also used as the soundtrack to a commercial for Budweiser, which was broadcast during Super Bowl XLI and as one of the musical selections played during the 2008 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.\n\nThe tune was used as background for a 2004 Nissan commercial featuring an appearance by Crystal Allen. In 2009 the song was used in a trailer (also in the actual game) for The Godfather II video game.\n\nJLS performed the song in live show 3 of The X Factor 5. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Dean+Martin/_/Ain%27t+That+a+Kick+in+the+Head\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

After the Q&A Felicity will be the audience and take part in a paid signing. Felicitiy Dean&#39;s film career began when she was cast as Lady Jane Grey in the 1977 feature film The Prince and the Pauper opposite Mark Lester, Oliver Reed, Raquel Welch and Charlton Heston. In 1978 she was labelled &quot;One of the 10 Women to Watch&quot; in that year by Cosmopolitan magazine, and appeared in the rarely seen comedy film Son of Hitler, opposite Bud Cort and Peter Cushing.\u00a0 In 1979 she was cast in the role of Caroline in the Mike Leigh film Who&#39;s Who. Felicity played the role of Dawn Meadows in Joseph Losey&#39;s 1985 feature film Steaming opposite Vanessa Redgrave, Sarah Miles and Diana Dors. She also appeared that same year in Water, directed by Dick Clement. She played Sarah opposite Michael Caine, Billy Connolly and Leonard Rossiter. In 1985 Felicity played Betsy in the Hugh Hudson film Revolution opposite Al Pacino and Donald Sutherland. She has continued to work with Pacino on his own personal projects. In 1987 she played Cynthia Goodburn in The Whistle Blower, again opposite Michael Caine alongside Nigel Havers. Felicity&#39;s TV work includes The Professionals entitled &#39;The Female Factor&#39; starring opposite Gordon Jackson, Martin Shaw and Lewis Collins. English novelist Rebecca West, perhaps best known for her reports on the Nuremberg Trials, personally picked Felicity to play Laura Bowen, the heroine of her novel The Birds Fall Down in a five-part BBC adaptation produced by Jonathan Powell in 1978. Critically acclaimed,this led to her going on to play many parts on television including Guinevere in The Legend of King Arthur for the BBC in 1978, Belinda Harlowe in The Far Pavilions opposite Ben Cross and Rupert Everett in 1984, and the Lynda La Plante series Trial & Retribution in 1999. She has also appeared in many popular television programmes between 1990 and 2009, including Midsomer murders, Peak Practice, Casualty, New Tricks, Rosemary & Thyme, Die Kinder, Van Der Valk, The Inspector Alleyn Mysteries, Kavanagh QC, Wycliffe, Hetty Wainthropp Investigates, Lovejoy, Doctors, and Murder in Suburbia. In 2017 she played the aged Queen Elizabeth I in the docu-drama Elizabeth I. Felicity&#39;s stage work is very extensive. In 1982 she auditioned for the Royal Shakespeare Company and originated the role of Annie in Good by C. P. Taylor. This production transferred to London&#39;s West End and then to Broadway. Douglas Watt from the Daily News said &quot;the performance and mounting of the work are flawless... in an eventually moving piece of theatre one of its assets is the fine work by Felicity Dean as mistress Anne&quot;. Walter Kerr of The New York Times offered that &quot;Felicity Dean is excellent in the role&quot;. While Jack Knoll of Newsweek said &quot; The cast are excellent, notably Felicity Dean as the nubile student who becomes Halders mistress&quot; Other stage work includes An Honourable Trade directed by Mike Bradwell for The Royal Court, Olivia in Twelfth Night for Nancy Meckler, for the Royal Shakespeare Company, Bianca in The Taming of the Shrew directed by Jonathan Miller, Julietta in Hyde Park, and Caroline in The Churchill Play, both for Barry Kyle.

Despite the fact that Martin couldn't read music, he recorded more than 100 albums over his career, racking up major hits such as That's Amore, Volare and his signature tune Everybody Loves Somebody. He was also a successful film actor and won a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in Who Was That Lady?.\n\nBorn Dino Paul Crocetti in Steubenville, Ohio to Italian immigrant parents, Gaetano and Angela Crocetti (n\u00e9e Barra). His father was an immigrant from Abruzzo, Italy, and his mother was an Italian of part Neapolitan and part Sicilian ancestry. Martin was the younger of two sons. His brother was called Bill. Martin spoke only Italian until he started school at the age of five. He attended Grant Elementary School in Steubenville, Ohio and took up the drums as a hobby as a teenager. He was the target of much ridicule for his broken English and ultimately dropped out from Steubenville High School in the 10th grade because he thought that he was smarter than his teachers. He delivered bootleg liquor, served as a speakeasy croupier, wrote crafty anecdotes, was a blackjack dealer, worked in a steel mill and boxed as welterweight. He grew up a neighbor to Jimmy the Greek.\n\nAt the age of 15, he was a boxer who billed himself as \"Kid Crochet\". His prizefighting years earned him a broken nose (later straightened), a scarred lip, and many sets of broken knuckles (a result of not being able to afford the tape used to wrap boxers' hands). Of his twelve bouts, he would later say \"I won all but eleven.\" For a time, he roomed with Sonny King, who, like Martin, was just starting in show business and had little money. It is said that Martin and King held bare-knuckle matches in their apartment, fighting until one of them was knocked out; people paid to watch.\n\nEventually, Martin gave up boxing. He worked as a roulette stickman and croupier in an illegal casino behind a tobacco shop where he had started as a stock boy. At the same time, he sang with local bands. Calling himself \"Dino Martini\" (after the then-famous Metropolitan Opera tenor, Nino Martini), he got his first break working for the Ernie McKay Orchestra. He sang in a crooning style influenced by Harry Mills (of the Mills Brothers), among others. In the early 1940s, he started singing for bandleader Sammy Watkins, who suggested he change his name to Dean Martin.\n\nIn October 1941, Martin married Elizabeth Anne McDonald. During their marriage (ended by divorce in 1949), they had four children. Martin worked for various bands throughout the early 1940s, mostly on looks and personality until he developed his own singing style. Martin famously flopped at the Riobamba, a high class nightclub in New York, when he succeeded Frank Sinatra in 1943, but it was the setting for their meeting.\n\nMartin repeatedly sold 10 percent shares of his earnings for up front cash. He apparently did this so often that he found he had sold over 100 percent of his income. Such was his charm that most of his lenders forgave his debts and remained friends.\n\nDrafted into the United States Army in 1944 during World War II, Martin served a year stationed in Akron, Ohio. He was then reclassified as 4-F (possibly due to a double hernia; Jerry Lewis referred to the surgery Martin needed for this in his autobiography) and was discharged.\n\nBy 1946, Martin was doing relatively well, but was still little more than an East Coast nightclub singer with a common style, similar to that of Bing Crosby. He drew audiences to the clubs he played, but he inspired none of the fanatic popularity enjoyed by Sinatra.\n\nOn March 21, 1987, Martin's son Dean Paul (formerly Dino of the '60s \"teeny-bopper\" rock group Dino, Desi & Billy) was killed when his F-4 Phantom II jet fighter crashed while flying with the California Air National Guard. A much-touted tour with Davis and Sinatra in 1988 sputtered. On one occasion, he infuriated Sinatra when he turned to him and muttered \"Frank, what the hell are we doing up here?\" Martin, who always responded best to a club audience, felt lost in the huge stadiums they were performing in (at Sinatra's insistence), and he was not the least bit interested in drinking until dawn after their performances. His final Vegas shows were at the Bally's Hotel in 1989. It was there he had his final reunion with Jerry Lewis on his 72nd birthday. Martin's last two TV appearances both involved tributes to his former Rat Pack members. In May of 1990, he attended Sammy Davis. Jr's 60th birthday celebration (only a few weeks before Davis died from throat cancer) and a few months later in December 1990, he congratulated Frank Sinatra on his 75th birthday special. By 1991, Martin had unofficially retired from performing.\n\nHis acting career achievements include being the \"ladies' man\" counterpart of Jerry Lewis in a series of comedies, and a main member of the Rat Pack, which also included Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., Peter Lawford, and Joey Bishop. Martin often seemed to be dead drunk on national TV in his long variety show run on NBC. The fact that America saw his show as charming and wholesome anyway is a testament not only to the culture of the time but to Martin's own great charm.\n\nDean was well-known as a family man and his \"drinking\" was just an act. It used to bother Frank Sinatra - who was a big drinker - that Dean went home early to be with his wife and kids, rather than go hitting the bars with him. In a recent biography, one of Dean's sons related that the only record of Dean that he and his wife played at home was one of his country western albums. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dean+Martin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In 1999, when they wished to include it on an upcoming CD compilation release, they sought permission but AC/DC refused.

It is the opening track of the group's 1979 album Highway to Hell and the twelfth track on AC/DC Live.\n\nThe song was written by Bon Scott, Angus Young and Malcolm Young while the main guitar riff was created by Malcolm Young. The track has become one of the most famous songs in rock history. AC/DC had made several studio albums before and was constantly supporting them by going on a grueling tour schedule.\n\nThe song and album's title supposedly came after a reporter asked bandmembers if they could describe what life was like being constantly on tour. Angus replied that it was \"a fucking highway to Hell\"[citation needed], and the name stuck. He stated in the magazine \"Guitar World\" that when you are out on the road on a bus sleeping with a guy's smelly sock in your face, it's like you're on the highway to hell. Rumours persisted that the band members were satanists, and this comment, and the album cover depicting Angus with devil horns and tail only added fuel to the fire. (The band has denied having anything to do with Satanism, Malcolm having even commented that \"me mum would kill me for that!\") Nevertheless, this and other songs brought AC/DC its first million-copy-selling album, and sent Highway to Hell to #17 on the charts. Scott would be found dead in the back of a friend's car just over six months later. The success of the Highway to Hell song and album set AC/DC on track to record its most famous album and tribute to Bon, Back In Black, one year later. The song \"Highway to Hell\" is part of the The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll list.[1] The single was certified Gold by the RIAA for sales in excess of 500,000. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/AC%2FDC/_/Highway+to+Hell\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released as a single in Germany, Australia and Japan. Shown is the cover of the German release of the \"Thunderstruck\" single. The song is said to be inspired by lead guitarist Angus Young's hair-raising experience when a plane he was on was struck by lightning. However, Angus Young was later to say that it \"started off from a little trick I had on guitar. I played it to Mal and he said 'Oh, I've got a good rhythm idea that will sit well in the back.' We built the song up from that... It was really just a case of finding a good title. We came up with this thunder thing and it seemed to have a good ring to it. AC/DC=Power. That's the basic idea.\"\n\nContrary to popular belief, Young does not play Thunderstruck's main riff with one hand. Instead, he picks every fretted note and pulls off the open notes. Additionally in all AC/DC live videos, Angus can clearly be viewed picking every fretted note. The one-handed tapping technique can only be seen in the \"Thunderstruck\" music video.\n\nThe video which accompanied the single was filmed at London's Brixton Academy on 17 August, 1990. The audience members were given free T-Shirts with the words 'AC/DC - I was Thunderstruck' on the front and the date on the back, and these T-shirts were worn by the entire audience throughout the filming of the video.\n\nThe music video of Thunderstruck on YouTube, as of May 2009, has over 20.6 million views. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/AC%2FDC/_/Thunderstruck\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

(Live At River Plate) (C) 2011 Leidseplein Presse B.V.."}, "description": "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap is a song by Australian hard rock band AC/DC. It is the title track and first track of their album Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, released in September 1976, and was written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott.\n\nIt was also released as a single - first in Australia in October 1976 with \"R.I.P. (Rock in Peace)\" as its B-side, and then in the UK in January 1977 as a maxi-single with \"Big Balls\" and \"The Jack\" as its B-sides. Once the Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap album was finally released in the US in 1981 the \"Dirty Deeds...\" single was released there (backed by \"Highway To Hell\"), where it reached number four on the charts.\n\nThe song ranked #24 on VH1's 40 Greatest Metal Songs and in 2009 it was named the 31st best hard rock song of all time also by VH1.\n\nIt features a backing vocal consisting of a heavy breathing sound, made on the downbeat during verses. It also features the title in a spoken-word style at the end of the chorus; plus a scream at the end of the song. The full length recording (approximately 4:11) has the title of the song chanted four times starting at 3:09, but on the more common edited version (approximately 3:51) the chant is heard only twice.\n\nThe song's narrator invites people experiencing problems to either call him on 36-24-36 or visit him at his home, at which point he will perform assorted unsavoury acts to resolve said problems. Situations in which he offers assistance include those involving lewd high school headmasters and significant others who are either adulterous or who persistently find fault with their partners. As detailed by the song, the \"dirty deeds\" performed at low cost include:\n\n    * Concrete shoes\n    * Cyanide\n    * TNT\n    * Neckties\n    * Contracts\n    * High voltage\n\nTwo of the services offered share names with AC/DC's first two Australian albums, T.N.T. and High Voltage. They are also the names of songs that appeared on Australia's T.N.T. and the international version of High Voltage. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/AC%2FDC/_/Dirty+Deeds+Done+Dirt+Cheap\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Of course, lyrics like \"my ace was high\" and \"how was I to know she'd been dealt with before\" give the song a different thematic shading that transforms it into a bawdy joke about catching a venereal disease.\nIf one listens to the live version of this song (If you want blood), Bon Scotts sings it with its real and uncensored lyrics . <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/AC%2FDC/_/The+Jack\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was released onto AC/DC's 8th studio album For Those About to Rock We Salute You in 1981. The cannons fired in the song are mixed with exploding fireworks. The video to this song was filmed live in Landover, Maryland in 1981. The song would later be released on AC/DC's first soundtrack album, Who Made Who, released five years later for the Stephen King film Maximum Overdrive.\n\nThe single's b-side contains an edited live version of \"Let There Be Rock\" from the Landover, MD show in 1981. The maxi-single contains the extended version of the same song.\n\nThe title and central lyric of the song are based on an ancient salute used by Roman gladiators, \"Ave, Caesar, morituri te salutant\" (\"Hail Caesar, we who are about to die, salute you.\"). However, Angus Young later said that the inspiration for the cannons came from a very different source. The band was cutting the first recordings of the song on the same day as Princess Diana of Great Britain's televised wedding. Angus recalled that \"someone had the wedding on in the next room... we were playing that part of the song when the cannons were going off and we paused a second and went 'hmmm... that actually sounds pretty good.'\" This coincidence also led to a cannon being featured on the cover of the album and single, as well as life-sized Napoleonic cannons becoming a regular stage prop at AC/DC concerts.\n\nAC/DC have often used the song to close live concerts, such as Live at Donington, No Bull, and Stiff Upper Lip Live as well as on their live CD AC/DC Live. It was also the last track on the Who Made Who album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/AC%2FDC/_/For+Those+About+to+Rock+(We+Salute+You)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is the first track of their Australian album T.N.T., released in December 1975 (see 1975 in music), and was written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young and Bon Scott. Musically, the song is notable for combining bagpipes with hard rock electric guitars, drums, and bass.\n\nA slightly shorter version of the song is also the first track on the international version of High Voltage, released in May 1976 (see 1976 in music). This is on the original release and the 2003 remastered CD release of the album only. Other CD releases have the full version.\n\nThis song is also on the Volts CD of the Bonfire box set, released in 1997.\n\nThis was a signature song for Scott, who also played the side drum in Coastal Scottish Pipe Band WA in the 1960s. Current AC/DC lead vocalist Brian Johnson doesn't perform it, out of respect for his predecessor.\n\nThe song is about the travails of using rock 'n' roll as a vehicle for success. As detailed by the song, \nperils of being in a rock 'n' roll band.\n\nIn May 2001, Australasian Performing Rights Association (APRA) celebrated its 75th anniversary by naming the Best Australian Songs of all time, as decided by a 100-member industry panel, \"It's A Long Way To The Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)\" was ranked as the ninth song on the list.The song is regularly played during stoppages at AFL matches at the ANZ stadium in Sydney\n\nIn Australia, children (and adults) sometimes sing \"It's a long way to the shop if you wanna sausage roll\" or \"It's a long way to the shop if you wanna Chicko Roll\". In the \"Kid's Kommentary\" on the DVD for School of Rock one of the kids quotes this line when the song is played during the end credits.\n\nOn 1 October 2004 Melbourne, Australia's Corporation Lane was officially renamed \"ACDC Lane\" in honour of the band (street names in the City of Melbourne cannot contain the \"/\" character). This change was made in part because the music video for \"It's A Long Way To The Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)\" was filmed on Melbourne's Swanston Street, near ACDC Lane. The Melbourne City Council's vote to rename the street was unanimous. Bagpipers played \"It's A Long Way To The Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)\" at the official renaming ceremony. \n\nThe music video for \"It's A Long Way To The Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)\", was filmed on 23 February 1976 for the Australian music television program Countdown. It featured the band's then-current lineup, along with members of the Rats of Tobruk Pipe Band, on the back of a flat-bed truck traveling on Swanston Street in Melbourne, Australia. The Young brothers, Evans, Rudd and the Rats of Tobruk Pipe Band all mimed playing their instruments, while Scott mimed his vocal and bagpipes. Known members of the Rats of Tobruk Pipe Band at the time of the video's filming include: Alan Butterworth, Les Kenfield and Kevin Conlon. The video was dubbed with the studio track from the T.N.T. album.\n\nThe video was directed by Paul Drane. David Olney was the cameraman.\n\nTwo other videos for the song exist. One features the group simply miming the song on a stage, making it appear as if it were being played live. The second version, filmed the same day as the truck version, features the group miming the song on a stage in a city park in front of an audience. The pipe players appear here as well. Also, a version of the group performing the song on Australian Bandstand with Scott singing live over the studio track appears on the DVD set Plug Me In. It should be noted that this song was only performed live in 1976. This song was not played after Bon set the bagpipes down at the corner of a stage and they were destroyed by fans. It was performed one last time in 1979, but synthesisers were used instead of the bagpipes. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/AC%2FDC/_/It%27s+a+Long+Way+to+the+Top+(If+You+Wanna+Rock+%27N%27+Roll)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Their albums have sold in colossal numbers; the total is now estimated at well over 200 million copies worldwide, with the 1980 album Back In Black selling over 21 million in the US alone and 40+ million worldwide, making it, according to statistics, one of the best selling albums in the world, outsold only by Michael Jackson's 'Thriller', and tied with Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon'. Their newest album released in 2008 entitled Black Ice is critically acclaimed even ahead of its release. The band has had two distinctive lead singers, and fans tend to divide its history into the \"Bon Scott era (1974-80)\" and the \"Brian Johnson era (1980-present)\".\n\nMost fans will agree that lead guitarist Angus Young (Now living In The Netherlands) is the face of AC/DC, appearing on the cover of most albums. His wild stage antics and schoolboy uniform have made him one of the most loved guitar players of all time. He has the unparalleled ability to captivate an audience of over 50,000 people with just the sounds of his guitar and his facial expressions. Most footage of Angus consists of him either doing Chuck Berry's patented Duck Walk across the stage, or of his mop of hair flying around as he rocks through one of his famous solos. Aside from captivating solos, he has also created some of the most well-known riffs together with his brother Malcolm Young.\n\nBon Scott was the second man to front AC/DC back in 1973 (Dave Evans was the first). He would always smile when he was singing and often made a sideways glance towards a camera if it was there with a grin on his face. Also known for wearing a School Girl outfit with pigtails and smoking a cigarette on their first TV performance, with his duties as lead vocalist, Scott also helped to write many of the band's most popular songs. He was lyrically at his best on such songs as \"Let There Be Rock\" and \"Shot Down in Flames\". Sadly, Bon died February 19th 1980 due to alcohol poisoning after a night of heavy drinking in London. It was around this time that AC/DC were starting to get global recognition.\n\nThe rhythm section of AC/DC included Malcolm Young (rhythm guitar), Cliff Williams (bass) and Phil Rudd (drums). Other drummers include Simon Wright ('83-'89) and Chris Slade ('89-'94).\n\nBrian Johnson (earlier in English Heavy rock band Geordie) became the new front man of AC/DC in early 1980 after Bon Scott passed away. Brian is known for always wearing his paperboy cap, a black tank top and blue jeans. He is noted for his distinctive, rough and jagged, yet powerful falsetto style of singing, with a remarkably high range. Well known examples for Johnson's characteristic vocals are found in the songs \"For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)\" and \"You Shook Me All Night Long\". With blessings from the Scott family, Brian has been singing his way into fans' hearts for over 25 years.\n\nAC/DC are currently on tour as of this writing. You can view the tour schedule at the Official AC/DC Website. \n\nMalcolm Mitchell Young (6 January 1953 \u2013 18 November 2017) was an Australian musician and songwriter, best known as a co-founder, rhythm guitarist, backing vocalist and songwriter for the hard rock band AC/DC. Except for a brief absence in 1988, he was with the band from its November 1973 beginning until retiring permanently in 2014, due to health reasons. Young and the other members of AC/DC were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003.\n\nThough his younger brother Angus is the more visible of the brothers, Malcolm has been described as the driving force and the leader of the band. He also added that despite his retirement from the band, AC/DC was determined to continue making music with his blessing. As the rhythm guitarist, he was responsible for the broad sweep of the band's sound, developing many of their guitar riffs and co-writing the band's material with Angus. He was married to Linda Young and had two children, Cara and Ross.\n\nYoung took a leave of absence from AC/DC in April 2014, to receive treatment for dementia. In September 2014, the band's management announced that he would be retiring permanently.\nMalcolm Young died on 18th of November, 2017, at the age of 64 after a three-year long battle with dementia. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/AC%2FDC\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Click to listen to Bruce Springsteen on Spotify: http://smarturl.it/BSpringSpot?IQid=BSpringBtR As featured on The Album Collection,..."}, "description": "Born to Run is the signature song of the American singer songwriter Bruce Springsteen, and the title song of his album Born to Run. Written in a small house in Long Branch, New Jersey in early 1974, the song was Bruce Springsteen's last-ditch effort to make it big. The prior year, Springsteen had released two albums to critical acclaim but with little commercial success. The lyrics to the song are appropriately epic for his last-ditch, all-or-nothing shot at the stars, yet they remain rooted in the universal desperation of adolescence: We gotta get out while we're young, 'cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run.\n\nWritten in the first person, the song is a love letter to a girl named Wendy (Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend I wanna guard your dreams and visions...; I wanna die with you Wendy on the streets tonight/in an everlasting kiss!), for whom the motorcycle-riding protagonist certainly has enough passion to love, but perhaps not the patience. However, Springsteen has noted that it has a much simpler core: getting out of Asbury Park.\n\nIn recording the song, Springsteen first earned his noted reputation for perfectionism, laying down as many as eleven guitar tracks to get the sound just right. The recording process and alternate ideas for the song's arrangement are described in the Wings For Wheels documentary DVD included in the 2005 reissue Born to Run 30th Anniversary Edition package.\n\nThe track was recorded at 914 Sound Studios in Blauvelt, New York amidst touring breaks during 1974, with final recording done on August 6, well in advance of the rest of the album, and featured Ernest \"Boom\" Carter on the drums and David Sancious on keyboards; they would be replaced by Max Weinberg and Roy Bittan for the rest of the album and in the ongoing E Street Band (which was still uncredited on Springsteen's records at the time). The song was also recorded with only Springsteen and Mike Appel as producers; it would be later in the following year, when work on the album bogged down, that Jon Landau was brought in as an additional producer.\n\nIn his 1996 book Songs, Springsteen relates that while the beginning of the song was written on guitar around the opening riff, the song's writing was finished on piano, the instrument that most of the Born to Run album was composed on.\n\nIn the period prior to the release of Born to Run Springsteen was becoming well-known (especially in his native northeast) for his epic live shows. \"Born to Run\" joined his concert repertoire well before the release of the album, being performed in concert by May 1974 if not earlier.\n\nThe first recording of the song was made by Allan Clarke of the British group The Hollies, although its release was delayed, only appearing after Springsteen's own now-famous version. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/_/Born+to+Run\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

According to the Dancing in the Dark Songfacts, Springsteen wrote this after his manager, Jon Landau, demanded a hit single from the album. After a brief altercation, he complied and wrote this that same night. Adding up-tempo synthesizer riffs and some syncopation to his sound for the first time, it became his biggest hit and, as the first single released from Born in the U.S.A., started it off to becoming the best-selling album of Springsteen's career.\n\n\"Dancing in the Dark\" was the last song written and recorded for Born in the U.S.A. Springsteen's producer and manager Jon Landau liked the album but wanted a sure-fire first single, one that was fresh and directly relevant to Springsteen's current state of mind (as much of Born in the U.S.A. had been written two years earlier). Landau and Springsteen got into an argument, but later on Springsteen wrote \"Dancing in the Dark\", and his irked mood from the day's argument combined with the frustrations at trying to complete the album quickly poured out into the lyrics.\n\nReleased as a single prior to the album's release, the song spent four weeks at #2 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart (his highest charting song to date) in June\u2013July 1984 (it was kept off the #1 spot by Duran Duran's \"The Reflex\" and that year's song of the summer, Prince's \"When Doves Cry\"). It did reach #1 on the Cash Box Top 100 Singles chart. It was also the first of a record-tying seven top 10 hit singles to be released from Born in the U.S.A. \"Dancing in the Dark\" also held the #1 spot for six weeks on Billboard's Top Tracks chart.\n\nAlthough the song only peaked at #5 in Australia, it remained on the charts for most of 1984 and was that country's highest selling single of the year. It spent a total of 64 weeks in the Top 100.[citation needed]\n\nIn the UK, \"Dancing in the Dark\" originally reached number 28 in the UK Singles Chart when released in May 1984. However, the song was re-released in January 1985 and subsequently reached number 4 in the charts, becoming the 27th best-selling single of the year.\n\nThe recording also won Springsteen his first Grammy Award, picking up the prize for Best Rock Vocal Performance in 1985. It also won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Stage Performance. In the 1985 Rolling Stone readers poll, \"Dancing in the Dark\" was voted \"Song of the Year\". The track has since gone on to earn further recognition and is as such listed one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\n\nThe Brian DePalma-directed video, set at a live performance, is perhaps best remembered for the appearance of Courteney Cox as a fan who is invited on stage by Springsteen, and dances with him. Cox was subsequently cast in Misfits of Science and Family Ties, and would later go on to be one of the stars of NBC's hit sit-com Friends. Although Cox had previously appeared in television commercials and had other roles, it is thought that her part in the video played a large role in launching her career.\n\nThe video was filmed in June 1984 at the St. Paul Civic Center in St. Paul, Minnesota, before and during the initial show of the Born in the U.S.A. Tour. The completed video was first aired on MTV on July 10, 1984. It received heavy airplay on MTV, and thus helped introduce Springsteen's music to a new, younger, and wider audience.\n\nIn a first for Springsteen in an effort to gain dance and club play for his music, and more non-whites in his audience, remix maestro Arthur Baker created the 12-inch \"Blaster Mix\" of \"Dancing in the Dark\", wherein he completely reworked the album version. Overdubbed were tom-toms, dulcimers, glockenspiel, assorted backing vocals, bass and horn sythesizer parts, and gunshot sounds. Springsteen's vocal part was chopped up, double-tracked, echoed and repeated, with certain lines such as \"You sit around getting older\" and \"Heeey, baby!\" made even more prominent. The remix was released on July 2, 1984.\n\nThe result generated a lot of media buzz for Springsteen, as well as actual club play; the remix went to #7 on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, and had the most sales of any 12-inch single in the United States in 1984. However, many of Springsteen's hard-core rock fans, who had been suspicious of the new sound of \"Dancing in the Dark\" to begin with, despised the remix. Baker was subsequently quoted in angry response: \"I got really offended. What is so different? It has a fucking glockenspiel, which Bruce has used before, background vocals ... it's no different. See, if any of those mixes had come out before, with no one knowing the other version, no one would have said a word.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/_/Dancing+in+the+Dark\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was recorded with Springsteen supplying almost all of the instrumentation, with bass and background vocals from \"Other Band\" member Tommy Simms. Additional saxophone and vocal parts by Ornette Coleman and \"Little\" Jimmy Scott, respectively, were recorded but never used.\n\nReleased in early 1994 as the main single from the film's original soundtrack, it became a huge success for Springsteen all over Europe and North America.\n\nThe song would achieve greater popularity in Europe than it would in the United States. While it peaked at #9 in the Billboard Hot 100 chart, it would become a number-one single in Germany and France. It would also peak at #2 in the United Kingdom, becoming Springsteen's highest charting hit in that country. It also peaked at #4 in Australia. \"Streets of Philadelphia\" ranks as his most recent top ten hit.\n\nThe song was also included in the album All Time Greatest Movie Songs, released by Sony in 1999. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/_/Streets+of+Philadelphia\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Taken from the album of the same name, it is one of his best-known singles. Rolling Stone ranked the song 275th on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 2001, the RIAA's Songs of the Century placed the song 59th (out of 365). Lyrically, the song deals with the effects of the Vietnam War on Americans, although it is widely misinterpreted as a patriotic anthem. According to the Born In The U.S.A. Songfacts, the original title was \"Vietnam.\" Director Paul Schrader sent Springsteen a script for a movie called Born In The U.S.A., about a Rock band struggling with life and religion. This gave Bruce the idea for the new title. Unfortunately for Schrader, when he was finally ready to make the movie in 1985, the title \"Born In The U.S.A.\" was too associated with the song. Springsteen helped him out however, providing the song \"Light Of Day,\" which became the new title for Schrader's movie and the feature song in the film.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/_/Born+in+the+U.S.A.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

(C) 1975 Bruce Springsteen."}, "description": "\"Thunder Road\" is a song written and performed by Bruce Springsteen, and the opening track on his 1975 breakthrough album Born to Run. It is ranked as one of Springsteen's greatest songs, and often appears on lists of the top rock songs of all time.\n\nThe lyrics to \"Thunder Road\" describe a young woman named Mary, her boyfriend, their hopeless lives and their \"one last chance to make it real.\" Thematically, it reads as a nostalgic companion piece to \"Born to Run\".\n\nMusically, the song opens with a quiet piano and harmonica introduction, meant, as Springsteen said years later in the Wings For Wheels documentary, as a welcoming to both the track and the album, a signifier that something was about to happen. Eschewing a traditional verse-and-chorus structure, the song's arrangement gradually ramps up in instrumentation, tempo and intensity. The title phrase is not used until the middle section of the song, and then is not used again. Finally, after the closing line there is a saxophone-and-piano duet in the instrumental coda.\n\nIn this song, Springsteen mentions Roy Orbison \"singing for the lonely\" on the radio. Orbison, one of whose best-known songs is \"Only the Lonely,\" was a huge influence on Springsteen.\n\nThe song's title comes from the Robert Mitchum film Thunder Road. Springsteen declared that he was somehow inspired from the movie even if, as he says, \"I never saw the movie, I only saw the poster in the lobby of the theater.\"\n\n\"Thunder Road\" is a classic rock staple, and has been covered by artists such as Melissa Etheridge, Cowboy Junkies, Badly Drawn Boy, brazilian singer Renato Russo, Mary Lou Lord[7], Bonnie 'Prince' Billy with Tortoise[8] and Frank Turner. Adam Duritz of Counting Crows often sings large portions of the lyrics to \"Thunder Road\" in the middle of their song \"Rain King.\"\n\nBadly Drawn Boy also ends his album Born in the UK with the line \"if we still don't have a plan, we'll listen to 'Thunder Road'\".\n\nIn the movie Explorers starring River Phoenix and Ethan Hawke, the name of the space vessel they create out of a Tilt-A-Whirl is \"Thunder Road\".\n\nIn an episode of King of Queens, Doug is seen playing a harmonica and then asking Spence if it \"sounded anything like Thunder Road\".\n\nIn the video game Rock Band 2, a clothing item from the Rock Shop that you can purchase is called Thunder Road. In reference to the song's lyrics, the item description reads, \"You got a guitar. You learned to make it talk. Slip on this jacket if you're ready for the long walk.\"\n\nIn the novel High Fidelity by Nick Hornby, the protagonist Rob Fleming ranks \"Thunder Road\" as one of his five best side one tracks. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/_/Thunder+Road\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In 1985 it became the fourth single released from his massively successful album Born in the U.S.A..\n\n\"I'm on Fire\" was recorded in February 1982 during the first wave of Born in the U.S.A. sessions. This took place in impromptu fashion when Springsteen started making up a slow tune on guitar for some lyrics he had, and drummer Max Weinberg and keyboardist Roy Bittan, hearing it for the first time, created an accompaniment on the spot. The result was a moody number that merges a soft rockabilly beat, lyrics built around sexual tension, and synthesizers into an effective whole; it was one of the first uses of that instrument in Springsteen's music.\n\nThe song peaked at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop singles charts in early 1985. It was the fourth of a record-tying seven Top 10 hit singles to be released from Born in the U.S.A. It is also remarkable that the single reached #1 in the Netherlands for 3 weeks in August 1985, at the same time as 2 other Springsteen singles (\"Dancing in the Dark\" and \"Born in the U.S.A.\") were occupying the Top 12.\n\nUnlike the first three singles from the album, no remixes were made for \"I'm on Fire\" (nor were any made for any of the subsequent singles released). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/_/I%27m+on+Fire\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Even though the album went through several different phases of what would be on it, \"Glory Days\" was always seen as one of the cornerstones. The song is a seriocomic tale of a man who now ruefully looks back on the so-called glory days of himself and people he knew during high school. The music is jocular, consisting of what Springsteen biographer Dave Marsh called \"rinky-dink organ, honky-tonk piano, and garage-band guitar kicked along by an explosive tom-tom pattern.\" It also features a mandolin solo from Steven Van Zandt, one of the sideman's most noticeable instrumental contributions to the Springsteen studio canon.\n\nAn alternate mix of \"Glory Days\" has circulated, which includes a deleted third verse between the second and the last. The missing verse refers to the singer's father sitting on a bar stool at the legion, bitter over his lack of any \"glory days.\"\n\nThe single peaked at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop singles charts in the summer of 1985. It was the fifth of a record-tying seven Top 10 hit singles to be released from Born in the U.S.A. Marsh named the second volume in his biography after the song.\n\nThe music video for the song was shot in late May 1985 in various locations in New Jersey, and was directed by filmmaker John Sayles, the third video he had done for the album. It featured a narrative story of Springsteen, playing the protagonist in the song, talking to his young son and pitching to a wooden backstop against an imaginary lineup (he eventually lost the game to Graig Nettles). Intercut with these were scenes of Springsteen and the E Street Band lip-synching the song in a bar. Although he had left the band more than two years earlier, Steven Van Zandt was invited back to perform in this video, along with his sometimes hysterical stage antics.... but the two new members of the band, Nils Lofgren and Patti Scialfa, who had not been on the record at all, were also featured. Springsteen's then-wife Julianne Phillips made a cameo appearance at the baseball field at the end.\n\nThe video began airing on MTV in mid-June 1985 and went into heavy rotation.\n\n\"Glory Days\" became a mainstay of the first set on the 1984-1985 Born in the U.S.A. Tour (prefaced by remarks in which Springsteen declared, \"I hated high school!\"), then went into the encores for the 1988 Tunnel of Love Express and 1992-1993 \"Other Band\" Tour, in the latter case serving as the \"band introductions\" song. It was given a rest for the 1999-2000 Reunion Tour, but then came back to appear in about half the shows on the 2002-2003 Rising Tour. Furthermore Springsteen often plays it in informal bar appearances, since it is one of his simpler songs for other musicians to pick up and play to.\n\nIn almost all instances, performances of \"Glory Days\" are accompanied by considerable Springsteen/E Street Band stage shtick, vamping on the outro, continuing the song on with false endings, everyone but the drummer and keyboard players coming out to stage front in a line, and so forth. A good example of the elongated concert \"Glory Days\" was on a highly-promoted July 30, 2002 appearance on The Today Show broadcasting from Asbury Park, New Jersey. Later in The Rising Tour, the song would become further extended by incorporating a long boogie-woogie organ solo from Danny Federici. Steven Van Zandt makes his vocals shine on this song, most recently on the Springsteen's Magic Tour.\n\nSpringsteen made a surprise appearance on Late Night With David Letterman on June 25, 1993 and played \"Glory Days\". This was Letterman's last appearance on NBC.\n\nGlory Days was played during Michael J. Fox's farewell scene during the season finale of the fourth season of Spin City.\n\nGlory Days was performed at the 2009 Super Bowl half-time show with minor lyric changes appropriate to the occasion (football player instead of baseball player, \"Hail Mary\" instead of \"speedball\".) During the song, Springsteen told Steve Van Zandt that they were going over their allotted 12 minutes, and Van Zandt responded that they should keep playing anyway. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/_/Glory+Days\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song also evokes the widespread uncertainty regarding gambling during its early years in Atlantic City and its promises to resurrect the city. This uncertainty and the man's uncertainty about taking the less-than-savory job are echoed in the lyrics \"Everything dies, baby, that's a fact, but maybe everything that dies some day comes back.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/_/Atlantic+City\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song tells the story of a man down on his luck and angry at the world, who wants a better lot in life. \nThe classic E Street Band sound is immediately presented on \"Badlands\", as a brief drums intro kicks in to a powerful piano-and-electric guitar riff. The song is taken fast but with a purpose, with Max Weinberg's most dynamic drumming on the album to the fore; indeed it contains his most famous beat, a one-two-three-four-five-six-(double time)one-two-three pattern underneath the verses. Late in the song a brief guitar break leads to a Clarence Clemons tenor saxophone part.

It also topped the U.S. adult contemporary chart, making the song Springsteen's only #1 song on this chart to date. The song is a synthesizer-based, low-tempo number that features Springsteen on vocals.\n\nThe song\u2019s lyrics begin with the speaker\u2019s memories of his father instilling pride in the family\u2019s hometown. While it first appears that the song will be a nostalgic look at the speaker\u2019s childhood, the song then goes on to describe the racial violence and economic depression that he witnessed as an adolescent and middle-aged man. The song concludes with the speaker\u2019s proclamation that he hopes to move his family out of the town.\n\nSome of the song's images derive directly from Springsteen's experiences growing up in Freehold Borough, New Jersey, in particular the racial strife in 1960s New Jersey and economic tensions from the same times (the \"textile mill being closed\" was the A & M Karagheusian Rug Mill at Center and Jackson Streets of Freehold).\n\n\"My Hometown\" stands in contrast to songs like John Mellencamp\u2019s \u201cSmall Town,\u201d which tend to romanticize the struggles of growing up in rural America. Additionally, \"My Hometown\" is perhaps a clearer representation of the themes presented in the title track of the album it originated from. While \"Born in the U.S.A.\" is a more bombastic tune, its mistrust of blind patriotism and nostalgia is often lost on listeners. Such ideas are more easily audible in \"My Hometown.\"\n\nThe music video for \"My Hometown\" was a straightforward video filming of a performance of the song at a Springsteen and E Street Band concert late in the Born in the U.S.A. Tour, eschewing fast-paced cutting for slower montages of Springsteen and various band members. Despite its lack of visual excitement, it still managed substantial MTV airplay.\n\n\"My Hometown\" was a staple selection on the Born in the U.S.A. Tour, in an arrangement very similar to the album. Springsteen sometimes preceded the song with a story about the tall veterans' monument in front of the courthouse in Freehold; later in the tour he announced gifts to local food banks, union funds, and related activities before playing the song.\n\n\"My Hometown\" was omitted during the 1988 Tunnel of Love Express Tour, but then appeared at all twenty performances on that year's later Human Rights Now! Tour, where it saluted people trying to take responsibility for their own freedom. It has been played on and off on Springsteen's various tours ever since; it is part of the repertoire of songs that Springsteen pulls out on a given night when he thinks it fits the theme or mood of a concert or location. The song has been performed about 260 times through 2008. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/_/My+Hometown\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released as the first single from the album, reaching position #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and #1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the United States. The followup single, \"Tunnel of Love\", also reached #1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, giving Springsteen two consecutive #1's. The single had less commercial success in other countries.\n\nLike much of the Tunnel of Love album, \"Brilliant Disguise\" was recorded in Springsteen's home studio, called Thrill Hill East, between January and May of 1987 with several members of the E Street Band. On this song, Springsteen played several instruments and is backed by Roy Bittan on keyboards, Danny Federici on organ and Max Weinberg on drums.\n\nSpringsteen himself wrote about the song \"after '85 I'd had enough and turned inward to write about men, women and love, things that have previously been on the periphery of my work.\"\n\nThe song was later released on the compilation album The Essential Bruce Springsteen.\n\n\nThe version currently playing on Last.fm is a cover by an unknown artist. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/_/Brilliant+Disguise\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It contains one of E Street Band saxophonist Clarence Clemons' most recognizable solos.  It also features short-time E Streeter Suki Lahav, who performs the delicate 23-note violin introduction to the song, accompanied by Roy Bittan on piano in the foreboding opening.\n\nThe song in its lyrics mirrors the pattern of the entire Born to Run album, beginning with a sense of desperate hope that slides slowly into despair and defeat. The song opens with the \"Rat\" \"driving his sleek machine/over the Jersey state line\" and meeting up with the \"Barefoot Girl,\" with whom he \"takes a stab at romance and disappears down Flamingo Lane.\" The song then begins to portray some of the scenes of the city and gang life in which the \"Rat\" is involved, with occasional references to the gang's conflict with the police. The last two stanzas, coming after Clemons' extended solo, describe the final fall of the \"Rat\" and the death of both his dreams, which \"gun him down\" in the \"tunnels uptown,\" and the love between him and the \"Barefoot Girl.\" The song ends with a description of the apathy towards the semi-tragic fall of the \"Rat\" and the lack of impact his death had- \"Nobody watches as the ambulance pulls away/Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light,\" \"Man the poets down here don't write nothin' at all/They just stand back and let it all be.\"\n\nThe two sides of the Born to Run album are meant to mirror one another, and so the song is similar in tone and theme to \"Backstreets\", the final track on Side 1. \"Backstreets\", though it does end on a pessimistic note, does not close with as emphatic and final a statement of hopelessness, and leaves open a small possibility for something better. \"Jungleland\"'s ending, with the \"Rat's\" own dream killing him, is meant to be the final end of the desperate optimism and dreams articulated from the very beginning of the album.\n\n\"Jungleland\" is considered one of Springsteen's best all-time songs, and appears accordingly on such lists. In September 2004, Q magazine rated it one of the \"1010 songs you must own\". In 2005, Bruce Pollock rated \"Jungleland\" as one of the 7,500 most important songs between 1944 and 2000. The aggregation of critics' lists at acclaimedmusic.net did not place this song in its list of the top 3000 songs of all time, but rated it as one of the 1975 songs \"bubbling under\" the top 3000.\nClarence Clemons playing his signature saxophone solo on \"Jungleland\" on the Magic Tour. TD Banknorth Garden, Boston, November 18, 2007.\n\nIn concert, \"Jungleland\" is usually played towards the end of shows. During the E Street Band's reunion tour in 1999 and 2000, it was part of a revolving \"epic\" slot, alternating with \"Backstreets\" and \"Racing in the Street\". When played, it is sometimes preceded by its Born to Run predecessor, \"Meeting Across the River\". Its appearances were rarer during The Rising Tour. During the 2007-2008 Magic Tour, \"Jungleland\" was played periodically, often played every third or fourth show in a slot where it alternated with \"Backstreets\", \"Rosalita\", \"Kitty's Back\", or \"Detroit Medley\" and gaining in frequency as the tour ended. It also appeared intermittently during the 2009 Working on a Dream Tour. Its performances in 2009 became substantially more frequent later in the tour as the band began to play Born To Run in its entirety at most shows. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/_/Jungleland\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was the second single released from his massively successful album Born in the U.S.A.\n\n\"Cover Me\" was one of the first songs recorded for the lengthy set of sessions that produced the album, and in fact was recorded as a demo, as the song was to be given to disco queen Donna Summer. However, Springsteen's manager Jon Landau heard the result and decided the combination of Springsteen's rock impulse, fierce guitar solo, and a strong (if unsubtle) dance beat had hit potential, and so kept the song for the upcoming Springsteen album, not even bothering to re-record it. Donna Summer was given \"Protection\" instead. Springsteen even recorded a duet with Summer, but it was never released. Springsteen was still unsure about \"Cover Me\", and Landau had to constantly argue to keep it included on the album.\n\nThe song peaked at #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles charts in late summer 1984. It was the second of a record-tying seven Top 10 hit singles to be released from Born in the U.S.A.\n\nNo music video was made for the song.\n\nContinuing the club play goal started with \"Dancing in the Dark\", Arthur Baker created the 12-inch \"Undercover Mix\" of \"Cover Me\". This was a large-scale transformation: a new bass line was cut, an unused backing vocal by industry legend Jocelyn Brown was restored, and reggae and dub elements were introduced. It was released on October 15, 1984.\n\nAs with the previous effort, the result displeased some of Springsteen's more strait-laced fans, but did gain actual club play: the remix went to number 11 on Billboard's Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart.\n\nSpringsteen was unsure of how to play \"Cover Me\" in concert, and initially it appeared irregularly in the 1984-1985 Born in the U.S.A. Tour. Then, inspired by Arthur Baker's remix, he rearranged it to open and close with a quiet, ominous, extended, echoing segment as new E Street backup singer Patti Scialfa wailed a snippet of Martha & the Vandellas' \"Nowhere to Run\" (in her one spotlight role of the show) while her future husband reverbed \"Cuh ... vuh ... me-ee-ee\", after which the song ramped up into showcase guitar work for Springsteen and Nils Lofgren. \"Cover Me\" thus became a featured song on the tour, often opening the second set; such a performance was included on the 1986 Live/1975-85.\n\n\"Cover Me\" continued as a regular selection on the 1988 Tunnel of Love Express and Human Rights Now! Tours, and the 1992 leg of the \"Other Band\" Tour (now without Scialfa's part). After December 1992 it was dropped. and as of May 2007 has never been heard in a regular Springsteen concert again. The song was played on Springsteen's first concert of two in Oslo the 7th of July and most recently in St. Louis on August 23, 2008. The song has been performed 300 times through 2008. The song has turned up as a semi-regular on the Working On A Dream Tour. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/_/Cover+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Along with his 14-year-old girlfriend Caril Fugate, he killed 10 people in Nebraska and brought out fears that rebellious movies and rock music were creating a new breed of offenders. Springsteen considered \"Starkweather\" as the title.\n\nThe 1973 movie Badlands, starring Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek, was inspired by Starkweather's story. After seeing a poster for the movie in a theater lobby, Springsteen used the title for his 1978 song, but did not see it until 1980.\n\nThis was the title track to the first album Springsteen recorded by himself. He recorded the songs at his house with a 4-track recorder, and after playing them with The E Street Band, decided they worked best as they were.\n\nE Street Band guitarist Steve Van Zant recalled to Rolling Stone magazine that Springsteen started cutting the tracks that made up Nebraska as demos for the band. However he saw potential in them and persuaded Springsteen to record them for an album: \"I remember him playing them for me one day and said 'Here's my new songs. We'll start rehearsing them as a band soon.' And I listened to this thing and I thought to myself, 'I gotta say there's something extraordinary about this.' There was no intention of it being a record and no intention of it being released, but there was something just extraordinarily intimate about it. And I thought 'What a wonderful moment has been captured here just accidentally.' And I said to him, 'Listen, I know this is a bit strange but I honestly think this is an album unto itself and I think you should release it.' And he was like 'What do you mean? It's just demos for the band.' And I'm like 'I know you didn't intended for this to be recorded but I just know greatness when I hear it, okay? It's my thing, it's why I'm a record producer and that's why I'm your friend and I'm just telling you I think your fans will just love this and I think it's actually an important piece of work. Because it captures this amazingly strange, weirdly cinematic kind of dreamlike mood. I don't know what it is. All I know is I know greatness when I hear it and this is it, okay? And this deserves to be heard I think people will love it and I think it's a unique opportunity to actually release something absurdly intimate.'\"\n\nSpringsteen included 4 mixes of this on the tape of demos he gave to his producer/manager Jon Landau, which would form the album of the same name.\n\nChrissie Hynde performed this on the 2000 album Badlands, a tribute album of songs from the album Nebraska. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/_/Nebraska\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In the original vinyl release, it concludes side one of the record.\n\n\"Backstreets\" begins with a minute-long instrumental introduction that features pianist Roy Bittan and organist Danny Federici, with only occasional traces of any other instruments being heard. In his review of Born to Run for Rolling Stone, writer Greil Marcus said:\n\n    \"Backstreets\" ... begins with music so stately, so heartbreaking, that it might be the prelude to a rock & roll version of The Iliad.\n\nThe song deals with the relationship between two friends: the narrator and Terry. They are forced to hide their love for each other from others and \"hide on the backstreets\". In the end, the relationship falls apart. Terry leaves with another man leaving the narrator alone and full of rage, love and sadness.\n\nThe gender of the character of \"Terry\" has long been debated among Springsteen fans. The name Terry can refer to either a male or a female. Proponents of the theory that Terry is male point out that the characters may be \"hiding on the backstreets\" in order to conceal their homosexuality. Or the song may merely be describing an intense male friendship with no other overtones. Those who believe that Terry is female cite Springsteen's own sexuality as well as the extended \"Sad Eyes\" performances of the song in which Terry is referred to as female by Springsteen himself.\n\nDuring the 1978 Darkness Tour, Springsteen would often add a semi-improvised interlude in between the final chorus and the outro. It usually involved Springsteen singing solo accompanied by the piano. The other instruments would then join in as the interlude built to a climax. It elaborated on the story of the protagonist and Terry. It differed from performance to performance but frequently involved the protagonist reminiscing about a good time he and Terry had shared, followed by an emotional condemnation of her subsequent betrayal.\n\nThis interlude has become known to Springsteen fans as the \"Sad Eyes\" interlude (not to be confused with the Springsteen song of the same name) due to frequently occurring lyrics stating that Terry had sad eyes or should dry her tears. It has also been referred to as the \"Baby I remember you\" or \"Little girl don't cry\" interlude. Parts of the interlude later materialized in recast form as the song \"Drive All Night\" on The River album in 1980. The interlude version of \"Backstreets\" has not been performed live since, however it can be heard on numerous fan bootlegs from that tour.\n\nIn 2007, during Springsteen and the E Street Band's Magic Tour, \"Backstreets\" frequently found its way into the set list, most likely as a tribute to Springsteen's longtime friend, Terry Magovern, who died earlier that year. It also opened the first show in 2008 following the death of longtime band member Danny Federici. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/_/Backstreets\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A high-tempo rocker, it was only included on the album at the insistence of Steven Van Zandt, but has since become a concert staple for Springsteen, usually in a low-key, acoustic arrangement. It became prominent worldwide in 2004 when John Kerry, the Democratic candidate in that year's presidential election in the United States and a fan of Springsteen, used this theme song as the main theme song for his campaign. Though it was not one of the seven Top Ten hits of the album, \"No Surrender\" nevertheless charted on the Mainstream Rock Charts, peaking at # 40.\n\nDuring the Born in the U.S.A. Tour, \"No Surrender\" was rarely played, instead of having a full band version the song was a slow acoustic guitar and harmonica version.\n\nThe song was played occasionally in the Reunion Tour, The Rising Tour and later tours, including the Magic Tour. The song has been performed about 230 times through 2008. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/_/No+Surrender\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Frequently featured in Springsteen and E Street Band concert performances, it first appeared on the Born to Run album in 1975. It was also released as the B-side to Springsteen's \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\" single.\n\nThe topic of the song is the rock staple of an intensely attractive, but cold-hearted woman, who causes massive emotional turmoil for her lover. Although the singer knows the woman is a liar, he wants to believe her.[3] The lyrics reflect both the joys and yearnings of summer nights. Like other songs on Born to Run, \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\" and \"Night\", the story of the relationship is told in a flashback. Musically, it has a staccato beat and a rhythm reminiscent of that of \"Bo Diddley\" songs. As if to emphasize the Diddley-like riff, Springsteen has sometimes led into \"She's the One\" in concert with a Diddley song - either \"Bo Diddley\" or \"Mona\". The percussive piano sound and the rhythms that are reminiscent of some Buddy Holly songs sound like an homage to older rock 'n' roll songs.\n\n\"She's the One\" has connections with other Springsteen songs. The line from Backstreets \"I hated you when you went away\" was originally a line in \"She's the One\". \"She's the One\" includes references to French cream and French kisses, which were originally included in an early Springsteen song, \"Santa Ana\". Springsteen has claimed that he wrote the song primarily because he wanted to hear E-Street Band saxophonist Clarence Clemons play its sax solo, and after he wrote the melody he wanted to hear he filled in the words.\nThe percussive piano part is a highlighted feature of one of many concert performances of \"She's the One\" by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. Working on a Dream Tour, Hartford Civic Center, April 24, 2009.\n\nThe song has become very popular live, and has been played 468 times as of 2008. Some fans have claimed that \"She's the One\" and \"Born to Run\" were first played at a concert where Springsteen opened for Bonnie Raitt at Harvard Square Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts on May 9, 1974. This has never been confirmed, and bootlegs of the concert do not contain either of these songs. The first confirmed live performance of the song was on October 4, 1974. \"She's the One\" was one of the songs that Springsteen wrote for before beginning to record the Born to Run album, along with \"Born to Run\", \"Thunder Road\" and \"Jungleland\", although originally he was not sure whether to include it on the album.[9] Several versions of the song were recorded for Born to Run between April and June 1975, and the June 1975 version recorded at 914 Sound Studios in Blauvelt, New York is the one that was officially released. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/_/She%27s+the+One\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Although this is one of the lesser known songs from Born to Run, \"Night\" has become somewhat of a stage favorite for the E Street Band. The song was not immediately played during the 1975 Born to Run Tour until later that year and more so in 1976 when it was used as the opening song. It was still sometimes being used as an opening song decades later during the 2007\u20132008 Magic Tour.\n\nThe mood of the music is mostly exciting as are the lyrics which have a romantic quality as well. The music is propelled by Gary Tallent's bass.[2] It is similar to the album's famous title track in that both songs deal with men and their fast cars.[3] The lyrics mostly describe the central character as a blue collar worker who, after working a full day, runs off into the night to go drag racing and search for the love of a woman.[3] For the protagonist, the only freedom and joy comes when he is on the highway, and he lives for the nights and weekends when he can escape work.[4] Like a couple of other songs on Born to Run, \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\" and \"She's the One\", the story of the relationship is told in a flashback.[5] The desperation and darkness of the lyrics makes a strong contracts with some of the other songs on the Born to Run album, which glorify night life.[2] Although \"Night\" and \"Born to Run\" show Springsteen beginning to deal seriously with blue collar protagonists, he would develop the theme further on his next album, Darkness on the Edge of Town, in which he would portray additional facets of blue collar working life on songs such as \"Badlands\", \"Adam Raised a Cain\", \"The Promised Land\", \"Prove It All Night\" and, especially, \"Factory\".[6][4] This central theme would later be explored on The River, especially in the song \"Out in the Street\", and became a focus of Springsteen's post-Darkness on the Edge of Town songwriting dealing with working class characters leading dead-end lives. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/_/Night\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In 1985 it became the sixth single released from his massively successful album Born in the U.S.A.\n\n\"I'm Goin' Down\" was recorded in May 1982 during the first wave of Born in the U.S.A. sessions. The track went on and off and back on the short list to make the album, finally bumping \"Pink Cadillac\" out of a place and into the B-side queue.\n\nThe song peaked at #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop singles charts in fall 1985. It was the sixth of a record-tying seven Top 10 hit singles to be released from Born in the U.S.A.\n\nThere was some controversy surrounding the release of yet another single from the album, which had been out for well over a year at that point. Cliff Bernstein, manager of Def Leppard and Dokken, said \"I think a sixth single is a little bit of overkill.\"\n\nNo music video or remixes were made for the song.\n\nOne of the least-performed Springsteen songs, \"I'm Goin' Down\" was irregularly played in the 1984 first leg of the Born in the U.S.A. Tour, then played not at all for a long stretch, then revived during the final summer 1985 leg, usually alternating with \"Darlington County\" in the set list.\n\nAfter that tour, \"I'm Goin' Down\" disappeared from sight completely for almost two decades, until it made three appearances in 2003 during The Rising Tour. Indeed \"I'm Goin' Down\" was largely forgotten not only by the general rock and pop audience but by the Bruce faithful as well, who have seen in preference several non-single tracks from Born in the U.S.A., such as \"Working on the Highway\", \"Bobby Jean\", and \"No Surrender\", became standard parts of the Springsteen repertoire. The song had only been played 44 times live as of 2008.\n\nBy the mid-late 2000s, there was a modicum of renewed interest in the song, with Frank Black recording it on the 2006 compilation Snake Oil and in early 2008 Kid Harpoon and Florence and the Machine doing a cover of the song. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bruce+Springsteen/_/I%27m+Goin%27+Down\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song is a lament to a lost spouse, and takes on a melancholy tone.\n\nThe song was recorded in March or April of 1982 at the Power Station in one of the first sessions for the Born in the U.S.A. album. Like several other Born in the U.S.A. songs, including \"Working on the Highway\" and the title track, a solo acoustic version of \"Downbound Train\" was originally recorded on the demo that eventually became the Nebraska album.\n\nThough it was not one of the seven singles released from said album, the song nevertheless gained something of a following, with some album-oriented rock radio airplay and being featured fairly regularly on the Born in the U.S.A. Tour and sporadically in tours since. It has been played about 130 times through 2008. Springsteen biographer Dave Marsh did not approve, calling \"Downbound Train\" in his volume Glory Days \"the weakest song [Springsteen]'s released since the second album, ... incredibly sloppy ...

With a recording career stretching back to 1966 that continues to this day, he's recorded multiple award-winning studio albums and toured constantly, inspiring generations of pop and rock musicians. He's often known as \"The Boss\". \n\nHe has frequently played as Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band. Most widely known for his brand of heartland rock infused with pop hooks, poetic lyrics, and Americana sentiments, he often sings songs centered around his native New Jersey. Initially inspired by the tuneful songwriting of British invasion music as well as the vocal swagger of Elvis Presley, his eloquence in expressing ordinary, everyday problems has earned him numerous awards, including twenty Grammy Awards and an Academy Award, along with a notoriously dedicated and devoted global fan base. He has sold over 70 million releases in the U.S. alone.\n\nSpringsteen's lyrics often concern men and women struggling to make ends meet. In this sense he was sometimes compared to Woody Guthrie and other popular folk artists. He has gradually become more and more identified with progressive politics, particularly working-class pride. Springsteen is also noted for his support of various relief and rebuilding efforts in New Jersey and elsewhere, and for his response to the September 11, 2001 attacks, on which his album The Rising reflects.\n\nSpringsteen's recordings have tended to alternate between commercially accessible rock and roll albums, often inspired by contemporary pop rock, and somber folk-oriented works. Much of his iconic status stems from the concerts and marathon shows in which he and the E Street Band present intense ballads, rousing anthems, and party rock and roll songs, among which Springsteen intersperses long, whimsical tales or deeply emotional stories alongside numerous jokes and asides.\n\nSpringsteen has long had the nickname \"The Boss,\" a term which he was initially reported to dislike but now seems to have come to terms with, as he sometimes jokingly refers to himself as such on stage. The nickname originated when a young Springsteen, playing club gigs with a band in the 1960s, took on the task of collecting the band's nightly pay and distributing it amongst his bandmates.\n\nEarly years\n\nSpringsteen was born in a hospital in Long Branch, New Jersey. He was raised in nearby Freehold. His father, Douglas Frederick Springsteen, was a bus driver of Dutch and Irish ancestry. His mother, Adele Ann Zirilli, was a legal secretary of Italian ancestry. He has an older sister, Virginia, and a younger sister, Pamela. Pamela Springsteen had a brief film career, but left acting to pursue still photography full time.\n\nRaised a Roman Catholic, Springsteen attended the St. Rose of Lima parochial school in Freehold Borough, where he was at odds with both the nuns and other students, even though much of his later music reflected a deep Catholic ethos and included many rock-influenced, traditional Irish-Catholic hymns.\n\nIn ninth grade he transferred to the public Freehold High School, but did not fit in there either. He completed high school but felt so uncomfortable that he skipped his own graduation ceremony. He briefly attended Ocean County College, but dropped out. It is rumored that the Dean of Students confronted Springsteen because his clothing made the other students \"uncomfortable.\"\n\nSpringsteen had been inspired to take up music at the age of seven after seeing Elvis Presley on The Ed Sullivan Show. At 13, he bought his first guitar for $18; later, his mother took out a loan to buy the 16-year-old Springsteen a $60 Kent guitar, an event he later memorialized in his song \"The Wish\".\n\nIn 1965, he went to the house of Tex and Marion Vinyard, who sponsored young bands in town. They helped him become the lead guitarist of The Castiles, and later lead singer of the group. The Castiles recorded two original songs at a public recording studio in Brick Township, New Jersey and played a variety of venues, including Cafe Wha? in Greenwich Village. Marion Vinyard said that she believed Springsteen when, as a young man, he said he was going to make it big.\n\nFrom 1969 through early 1971, Springsteen performed around New Jersey with guitarist Steve Van Zandt, organist Danny Federici and drummer Vini Lopez in a band called Child, later renamed Steel Mill. They went on to play the mid-Atlantic college circuit, and also briefly in California. During this time Springsteen also performed regularly at small clubs in Asbury Park and along the Jersey Shore, quickly gathering a cult following. Other acts followed over the next two years, as Springsteen sought to shape a unique and genuine musical and songwriting style: Dr Zoom & the Sonic Boom (early-mid 1971), Sundance Blues Band (mid 1971), and The Bruce Springsteen Band (mid 1971-mid 1972). With the addition of pianist David Sancious, the core of what would later become the E Street Band was formed, with occasional temporary additions such as horns sections, \"The Zoomettes\" (a group of female backing vocalists for \"Dr Zoom\") and Southside Johnny Lyon on harmonica. Musical genres explored included blues, R&B, jazz, church music, early rock'n'roll, and soul. His profilic songwriting ability, with more words in some individual songs than other artists had in whole albums, brought his skill to the attention of several people who were about to change his life: new managers Mike Appel and Jim Cretecos, and legendary Columbia Records talent scout John Hammond, who, under Appel's pressure, auditioned Springsteen in May 1972.\n\nEven after gaining international acclaim, Springsteen's New Jersey roots reverberated in his music, and he routinely praised \"the great state of New Jersey\" in his live shows. Drawing on his extensive local appeal, he routinely sold out consecutive nights in major New Jersey and Philadelphia venues and, much like the Grateful Dead, his song lists varied significantly from one night to the next. He also made many surprise appearances at The Stone Pony and other shore nightclubs over the years, becoming the foremost exponent of the Jersey Shore sound.\n\n1972\u20131974\nSpringsteen signed a record deal with Columbia Records in 1972, with the help of John Hammond, who had signed Bob Dylan to the same record label a decade earlier. Springsteen brought many of his New Jersey-based colleagues into the studio with him, thus forming the E Street Band (although it would not be formally named as such for a couple more years). His debut album, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J., released in January 1973, established him as a critical favorite, though sales were slow. Because of his lyrics-heavy, folk rock-rooted music exemplified on tracks like \"Blinded by the Light\" and \"For You,\" as well as the Columbia and Hammond connections, critics initially compared Springsteen to Bob Dylan. \"He sings with a freshness and urgency I haven't heard since I was rocked by 'Like a Rolling Stone',\" wrote Crawdaddy magazine editor Peter Knobler in Springsteen's first interview/profile, in March, 1973. Crawdaddy \"discovered\" Springsteen in the rock press and was his earliest champion. Famed music critic Lester Bangs wrote in Creem, 1975, that when Springsteen's first album was released.....\"many of us dismissed it: he wrote like Bob Dylan and Van Morrison, sang like Van Morrison and Robbie Robertson, and led a band that sounded like Van Morrison's.\" The track \"Spirit in the Night\" especially showed Morrison's influence, while with \"Lost in the Flood\" Springsteen presented the first of his many portraits of Vietnam veterans.\n\nIn September 1973 his second album, The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle was released, again to critical acclaim but no commercial success. Springsteen's songs became grander in form and scope, with the E Street Band providing a less folky, more R&B vibe and the lyrics often romanticizing teenage street life. \"4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)\" and \"Incident on 57th Street\" would become fan favorites, and the long, rousing \"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)\" would rank among Springsteen's most beloved concert numbers.\n\nIn the May 22, 1974 issue of Boston's The Real Paper, music critic Jon Landau wrote after seeing a performance at the Harvard Square Theater, \"I saw rock and roll future and its name is Bruce Springsteen. And on a night when I needed to feel young, he made me feel like I was hearing music for the very first time.\" Landau subsequently became Springsteen's manager and producer, helping to finish the epic new album, Born to Run. Given an enormous budget in a last-ditch effort at a commercially viable record, Springsteen became bogged down in the recording process while striving for a wall of sound production. But, fed by the release of an early mix of \"Born to Run\" to progressive rock radio, anticipation built toward the album's release.\n\n1975\u20131981\nOn August 13, 1975, Springsteen and the E Street Band began a five-night, 10-show stand at New York's Bottom Line club; it attracted major media attention, was broadcast live on WNEW-FM, and convinced many skeptics that Springsteen was for real. (Decades later, Rolling Stone magazine would name the stand as one of the 50 Moments That Changed Rock and Roll.) With the release of Born to Run on August 25, 1975, Springsteen finally found success: while there were no real hit singles, \"Born to Run\", \"Thunder Road\", \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-out\" and \"Jungleland\" all received massive FM radio airplay and remain perennial favorites on many classic rock stations to this day. With its panoramic imagery, thundering production and desperate optimism, some fans consider this among the best rock and roll albums of all time and Springsteen's finest work. It established him as a sincere and dynamic rock and roll personality who spoke for and in the voice of a large part of the rock audience. To cap off the triumph, Springsteen appeared on the covers of both Time and Newsweek in the same week, on October 27 of that year. So great did the wave of publicity become that Springsteen eventually rebelled against it during his first venture overseas, tearing down promotional posters before a concert appearance in London.\n\nA legal battle with former manager Mike Appel kept Springsteen out of the studio for over two years, during which time he kept The E Street Band together through extensive touring across the U.S. Despite the optimistic fervor with which he often performed, the new songs he was writing and often debuting on stage had taken a more somber tone than much of his previous work. Reaching settlement with Appel in 1977, Springsteen finally returned to the studio, and the subsequent sessions produced Darkness on the Edge of Town (1978). Musically, this album was a turning point of Springsteen's career. Gone were the rapid-fire lyrics, outsized characters and long, multi-part musical compositions of the first three albums; now the songs were leaner and more carefully drawn and began to reflect Springsteen's growing intellectual and political awareness. Some fans consider Darkness Springsteen's best and most consistent record; tracks such as \"Badlands\" and \"The Promised Land\" became concert staples for decades to come, while the track \"Prove It All Night\" received a significant amount of radio airplay (#33, Billboard Hot 100). Other fans would prefer the work of the adventurous early Springsteen. The cross-country 1978 tour to promote the album would become legendary for the intensity of its shows.\n\nBy the late 1970s, Springsteen had earned a reputation in the pop world as a songwriter whose material could provide hits for other bands. Manfred Mann's Earth Band had achieved a U.S. number one pop hit with a heavily rearranged version of Greetings' \"Blinded by the Light\" in early 1977. Patti Smith reached number 13 with her take on Springsteen's unreleased \"Because the Night\" (which Smith co-wrote) in 1978, while The Pointer Sisters hit number two in 1979 with Springsteen's also-unreleased \"Fire\".\n\nIn September 1979, Springsteen and the E Street Band joined the Musicians United for Safe Energy anti-nuclear power collective at Madison Square Garden for two nights, playing an abbreviated setlist while premiering two songs from his upcoming album. The subsequent No Nukes live album, as well as the following summer's No Nukes documentary film, represented the first official recordings and filmings of Springsteen's fabled live act, as well as Springsteen's first tentative dip into political involvement.\n\nSpringsteen continued to consolidate his thematic focus on working-class life with the double album The River in 1980, which finally yielded his first hit Top Ten single as a performer, \"Hungry Heart\", but also included an intentionally paradoxical range of material from good-time party rockers to emotionally intense ballads. The album sold well, and a long tour in 1980 and 1981 followed, featuring Springsteen's first extended playing of Europe and ending with a series of multi-night arena stands in major cities in the U.S.\n\n1982\u20131989\nSpringsteen suddenly veered off the normal rock career course, following The River with the stark solo acoustic Nebraska in 1982. According to the Marsh biographies, Springsteen was in a depressed state when he wrote this material, and the result is a brutal depiction of American life. The title track on this album is about the murder spree of Charles Starkweather. The album actually started (according to Marsh) as a demo tape for new songs to be played with the E Street Band - but during the recording process, Springsteen and producer Landau realized they worked better as solo acoustic numbers; several attempts at re-recording the songs in a studio led them to realize that the original versions, recorded on a simple, low-tech four-track cassette deck in Springsteen's kitchen, were the best versions they were going to get.\n\nWhile Nebraska did not sell especially well, it garnered widespread critical praise (including being named \"Album of the Year\" by Rolling Stone magazine's critics) and influenced later significant works by other major artists, including U2's album, The Joshua Tree. It helped inspire the musical genre known as lo-fi music, becoming a cult favorite among indie-rockers. Springsteen did not tour in conjunction with Nebraska's release.\n\nSpringsteen probably is best known for his album Born in the U.S.A. (1984), which sold 15 million copies in the U.S. alone and became one of the best-selling albums of all time with seven singles hitting the top 10, and the massively successful world tour that followed it. The title track was a bitter commentary on the treatment of Vietnam veterans, some of whom were Springsteen's friends and bandmates. The song was widely misinterpreted as jingoistic, and in connection with the 1984 presidential campaign became the subject of considerable folklore. Springsteen also turned down several million dollars offered by Chrysler Corporation for using the song in a car commercial. (In later years, Springsteen performed the song accompanied only with acoustic guitar to make the song's original meaning more explicitly clear. An acoustic version also appeared on Tracks, a later album.) \"Dancing in the Dark\" was the biggest of seven hit singles from Born in the U.S.A., peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard music charts. The music video for the song featured a young Courteney Cox dancing on stage with Springsteen, an appearance which helped kickstart the actress's career; a number of the videos for the album were made by noted film directors Brian De Palma or John Sayles.\n\nDuring the Born in the U.S.A. Tour he met actress Julianne Phillips. They were married in Lake Oswego, Oregon, on May 13, 1985 surrounded by intense media attention. Opposites in background, their marriage was not to be long-lived. Springsteen's 1987 album Tunnel of Love described some of his unhappinesses in the relationship and during the subsequent Tunnel of Love Express tour, Springsteen took up with backup singer Patti Scialfa, as reported by many tabloids. Subsequently, Phillips and Springsteen filed for divorce in 1988. The divorce was finalized in 1989.\n\nThe Born in the U.S.A. period represented the height of Springsteen's visibility in popular culture and the broadest audience demographic he would ever reach (this was further helped by releasing Arthur Baker dance mixes of three of the singles). Live/1975\u201385, a five-record box set (also released on three cassettes or three CDs), was released near the end of 1986 and also became a huge success, selling 13 million units in the U.S. and becoming the first box set to debut at No. 1 on the U.S. album charts. It is one of the best selling live albums of all time. It summed up Springsteen's career to that point and displayed some of the elements that made his shows so powerful to his fans: the switching from mournful dirges to party rockers and back; the communal sense of purpose between artist and audience; the long, intense spoken passages before songs, including those describing Springsteen's difficult relationship with his father; and the instrumental prowess of the E Street Band, such as in the long coda to \"Racing in the Street\". Despite its popularity, some fans and critics felt the album's song selection could have been better. Springsteen concerts are the subjects of frequent bootleg recording and trading among fans.\n\nAfter this commercial peak, Springsteen released the much more sedate and contemplative Tunnel of Love (1987), a mature reflection on the many faces of love found, lost and squandered, which only selectively used the E Street Band. It presaged the breakup of his first marriage, to Julianne Phillips. Reflecting the challenges of love in Brilliant Disguise, Springsteen sang:\n\n    I heard somebody call your name, from underneath our willow. I saw something tucked in shame, underneath your pillow. Well I've tried so hard baby, but I just can't see. What a woman like you is doing with me.\n\nThe subsequent Tunnel of Love Express tour shook up fans with changes to the stage layout, favorites dropped from the set list, and horn-based arrangements; during the European leg in 1988, Springsteen's relationship with E Street Band backup singer Patti Scialfa became public. Later in 1988, Springsteen headlined the truly worldwide Human Rights Now! tour for Amnesty International. In the fall of 1989, he dissolved the E Street Band, and he and Scialfa relocated to California.\n\n1990s\nSpringsteen married Scialfa in 1991; they have three children Evan James (b. 1990), Jessica Rae (b.1991) and Sam Ryan (b.1994).\n\nIn 1992, after risking charges of \"going Hollywood\" by moving to Los Angeles (a radical move for someone so linked to the blue-collar life of the Jersey Shore) and working with session musicians, Springsteen released two albums at once. Human Touch and Lucky Town were even more introspective than any of his previous work. Also different about these albums was the confidence he displayed. As opposed to his first two albums, which dreamed of happiness, and his next four, which showed him growing to fear it, at points during the Lucky Town album, Springsteen actually claims happiness for himself.\n\nSome E Street Band fans voiced (and continue to voice) a low opinion of these albums, (especially Human Touch), and did not follow the subsequent \"Other Band\" Tour. For other fans, however, who had only come to know Springsteen after the 1975 consolidation of the E Street Band, the \"Other Band\" Tour was an exciting opportunity to see Springsteen develop a working onstage relationship with a different group of musicians, and to see him explore the Asbury Park soul-and-gospel base in some of his classic material.\n\nIt was also during this tour that fans generally became aware of Springsteen using a teleprompter so as to not forget his lyrics, a practice that has continued ever since. An electric band appearance on the acoustic MTV Unplugged television program (that was later released as In Concert/MTV Plugged) was poorly received and further cemented fan dissatisfaction. Springsteen seemed to realize this a few years hence when he spoke humorously of his late father during his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame acceptance speech:\n\n    I've gotta thank him because \u2014 what would I conceivably have written about without him? I mean, you can imagine that if everything had gone great between us, we would have had disaster. I would have written just happy songs \u2013 and I tried it in the early '90s and it didn't work; the public didn't like it.\n\nA multiple Grammy Award winner, Springsteen also won an Academy Award in 1994 for his song \"Streets of Philadelphia\", which appeared in the soundtrack to the film Philadelphia. The song, along with the film, was applauded by many for its sympathetic portrayal of a gay man dying of AIDS. The music video for the song shows Springsteen's actual vocal performance, recorded using a hidden microphone, to a prerecorded instrumental track. This was a technique developed on the \"Brilliant Disguise\" video.\n\nIn 1995, after temporarily re-organizing the E Street Band for a few new songs recorded for his first Greatest Hits album (a recording session that was chronicled in the documentary Blood Brothers), he released his second (mostly) solo guitar album, The Ghost of Tom Joad. This was generally less well-received than the similar Nebraska, due to the minimal melody, twangy vocals, and didactic nature of most of the songs, although some praised it for giving voice to immigrants and others who rarely have one in American culture. The lengthy, worldwide, small-venue solo acoustic Ghost of Tom Joad Tour that followed successfully featured many of his older songs in drastically reshaped acoustic form, although Springsteen had to explicitly remind his audiences to be quiet during the performances.\n\nFollowing the tour, Springsteen moved back to New Jersey with his family. In 1998, another precursor to the E Street Band's upcoming re-birth appeared in the form of a sprawling, four-disc box set of out-takes, Tracks. In 1999, Springsteen and the E Street Band officially came together again and went on the extensive Reunion Tour, lasting over a year. Highlights included a record sold-out, 15-show run at Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey to kick off the American leg of the tour.\n\n2000s\nSpringsteen's Reunion Tour with the E Street Band ended with a triumphant ten-night, sold-out engagement at New York City's Madison Square Garden in mid-2000 and controversy over a new song, \"American Skin (41 Shots)\", about the police shooting of Amadou Diallo. The final shows at Madison Square Garden were recorded and resulted in an HBO Concert, with corresponding DVD and album releases as Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band: Live in New York City.\n\nIn 2002, Springsteen released his first studio effort with the full band in 18 years, The Rising, produced by Brendan O'Brien. The album, mostly a reflection on the September 11 attacks, was a critical and popular success. The title track gained airplay in several radio formats, and the record became Springsteen's best-selling album of new material in 15 years. Kicked off by an early-morning Asbury Park appearance on The Today Show, The Rising Tour commenced, barnstorming through a series of single-night arena stands in the U.S. and Europe to promote the album in 2002, then returning for large-scale, multiple-night stadium shows in 2003. While Springsteen had maintained a loyal hardcore fan base everywhere (and particularly in Europe), his general popularity had dipped over the years in some southern and midwestern regions of the U.S. But it was still strong in Europe and along the U.S. coasts, and he played an unprecedented 10 nights in Giants Stadium in New Jersey, a ticket-selling feat to which no other musical act has come close. During these shows Springsteen thanked those fans who were attending multiple shows and those who were coming from long distances or another country; the advent of robust Bruce-oriented online communities had made such practices more common. The Rising Tour came to a final conclusion with three nights in Shea Stadium, highlighted by renewed controversy over \"American Skin\" and a guest appearance by Bob Dylan.\n\nDuring the 2000s, Springsteen became a visible advocate for the revitalization of Asbury Park, and he's played an annual series of winter holiday concerts there to benefit various local businesses, organizations and causes. These shows are explicitly intended for the faithful, featuring numbers such as the unreleased (until Tracks) E Street Shuffle outtake \"Thundercrack\", a rollicking group-participation song that would mystify casual Springsteen fans. He also frequently rehearses for tours in Asbury Park; some of his most devoted followers even go so far as to stand outside the building to hear what fragments they can of the upcoming shows. The song \"My City of Ruins\" was originally written about Asbury Park, in honor of the attempts to revitalize the city. Looking for an appropriate song for a post-Sept. 11 benefit concert honoring New York City, he selected \"My City of Ruins,\" which was immediately recognized as an emotional highlight of the concert, with its gospel themes and its heartfelt exhortations to \"Rise up!\" The song became associated with post-9/11 New York, and he chose it to close \"The Rising\" album and as an encore on the subsequent tour.\n\nAt the Grammy Awards of 2003, Springsteen performed The Clash's \"London Calling\" along with Elvis Costello, Dave Grohl, and E Street Band member Steven Van Zandt in tribute to Joe Strummer; Springsteen and the Clash had once been considered multiple-album-dueling rivals at the time of the double The River and the triple Sandinista!.\n\nIn 2004, Springsteen announced that he and the E Street Band would participate in a politically motivated \"Vote for Change\" tour, in conjunction with John Mellencamp, John Fogerty, the Dixie Chicks, Pearl Jam, R.E.M., Bright Eyes, Dave Matthews Band, Jackson Browne and other musicians. All concerts were to be held in swing states, to benefit MoveOn.org and to encourage people to vote against George W. Bush. A finale was held in Washington, D.C., bringing many of the artists together. Several days later, Springsteen held one more such concert in New Jersey, when polls showed that state surprisingly close. While in past years Springsteen had played benefits for causes in which he believed \u2013 against nuclear energy, for Vietnam veterans, Amnesty International and the Christic Institute \u2013 he had always refrained from explicitly endorsing candidates for political office (indeed he had rejected the efforts of Walter Mondale to attract an endorsement during the 1984 Reagan \"Born in the U.S.A.\" flap). This new stance led to criticism and praise from the expected partisan sources. Springsteen's \"No Surrender\" became the main campaign theme song for John Kerry's unsuccessful presidential campaign; in the last days of the campaign, he performed acoustic versions of the song and some of his other old songs at Kerry rallies. Springsteen's stance coincided with a reduction in his fan base over the next two years, but how much was due to his politics versus his noncommercial music choices was unclear.\n\nDevils & Dust was released on April 26, 2005, and was recorded without the E Street Band. It is a low-key, mostly acoustic album, in the same vein as Nebraska and The Ghost of Tom Joad although with a little more instrumentation. Some of the material was written almost 10 years earlier during, or shortly after, the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour, a couple of them being performed then but never released. The title track concerns an ordinary soldier's feelings and fears during the Iraq War. Starbucks rejected a co-branding deal for the album, due in part to some sexually explicit content but also because of Springsteen's anti-corporate politics. Nonetheless, the album entered the album charts at No. 1 in 10 countries (United States, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Ireland). Springsteen began the solo Devils & Dust Tour at the same time as the album's release, playing both small and large venues. Attendance was disappointing in a few regions, and everywhere (other than in Europe) tickets were easier to get than in the past. Unlike his mid-1990s solo tour, he performed on piano, electric piano, pump organ, autoharp, ukulele, banjo, electric guitar and stomping board, as well as acoustic guitar and harmonica, adding variety to the solo sound. (Offstage synthesizer, guitar and percussion also are used for some songs.) Unearthly renditions of \"Reason to Believe\", \"The Promised Land\", and Suicide's \"Dream Baby Dream\" jolted audiences to attention, while rarities, frequent set list changes, and a willingness to keep trying even through audible piano mistakes kept most of his loyal audiences happy.\n\nIn November 2005, New Jersey Senators Frank Lautenberg and Jon Corzine sponsored a U.S. Senate resolution to honor Springsteen on the 30th anniversary of the release of his Born to Run album. In general, resolutions honoring native sons are passed with a simple voice vote. For unstated reasons, this resolution was killed in committee. Also in November 2005, Sirius Satellite Radio started a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week radio station on Channel 10 called \"E Street Radio.\" This channel featured commercial-free Bruce Springsteen music, including rare tracks, interviews and daily concerts of Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band recorded throughout their career.\n\nIn April 2006, Springsteen released another radical departure, We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions, an American roots music project focused around a big folk sound treatment of 15 songs popularized by the radical musical activism of Pete Seeger. It was recorded with a large ensemble of musicians, including only Patti Scialfa, Soozie Tyrell, and The Miami Horns from past efforts. In contrast to previous albums, this was recorded in only three one-day sessions, and frequently one can hear Springsteen calling out key changes live as the band explores its way through the tracks. The Bruce Springsteen with The Seeger Sessions Band Tour began the same month, featuring the 18-strong ensemble of musicians dubbed the Seeger Sessions Band (and later shortened to the Sessions Band). Seeger Sessions material was heavily featured, as well as a handful of (usually drastically rearranged) Springsteen numbers. The tour proved very popular in Europe, selling out everywhere and receiving some excellent reviews, but newspapers reported that a number of U.S. shows suffered from sparse attendance. By the end of 2006, the Seeger Sessions tour toured Europe twice and toured America for only a short span. Bruce Springsteen with The Sessions Band: Live in Dublin, containing selections from three nights of November 2006 shows at the The Point Theatre in Dublin, Ireland, was released the following June.\n\nSpringsteen's most recent album, entitled Magic, was released on October 2, 2007. Recorded with the E Street Band, it featured ten new announced Springsteen songs plus \"Long Walk Home,\" performed once with the Sessions band, and a hidden track (the first included on a Springsteen studio release), \"Terry's Song,\" a tribute to Springsteen's long-time assistant Terry Magovern who died on July 30, 2007. The first single \"Radio Nowhere\" was made available for a free download on August 28. On October 7, Magic debuted at number 1 in Ireland and the UK. Greatest Hits reentered the Irish charts at number 57, and Live in Dublin almost cracked the top 20 in Norway again. On October 11, 2007 Media Traffic reported that Springsteen's Magic sold 563,000 copies around the world in its first week, making it the best-selling record in the world for that particular week. The next world chart saw Bruce remain at the top, selling another 270,000 copies of Magic and bringing the total for that album to 833,000 copies worldwide. Sirius Satellite Radio also restarted \"E Street Radio\" on Channel 10, on September 27, 2007 in anticipation of Magic. Radio conglomerate Clear Channel Communications reportedly decided to not play the new album, sending an edict to its classic rock stations to not play any songs from the new album, while continuing to play older Springsteen material.\n\nAn accompanying tour with the E Street Band began at the Hartford Civic Center with the album's release and was routed to North America and Europe. Springsteen and the band performed live on NBC's Today Show in advance of the opener. Springsteen was the musical guest on November 9, 2007 at former-New York Yankees manager Joe Torre's \"Safe At Home\" Foundation's 5th annual gala. Yankees' outfielder Bernie Williams joined Springsteen on stage and contibuted two guitar solos to an impromptu rendition of the Springsteen hit, \"Glory Days\".\n\nMagic was followed up by a traditionally strong tour throughout 2008, during which original band-member and friend Danny Federici passed away. Federici had already been temporarily replaced by Charlie Giordano, with whom Springsteen played the year before during the Seeger Sessions. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band rounded the 100-show tour at Harley-Davidson\u2019s 105th anniversary celebration.\n\nOn January 27, 2009 Springsteen\u2019s twenty-fourth album \u201cWorking on a Dream\u201d was released. According to the official press release, Working on a Dream was recorded with the E Street Band and features twelve new Springsteen compositions plus two bonus tracks. It is the fourth collaboration between Springsteen and Brendan O\u2019Brien, who produced and mixed the album. A new tour for 2009 is expected to be announced soon. Springsteen and the E Street Band will play The Super Bowl halftime show on February 1, 2009.\n\nSpringsteen's 17th studio album, Wrecking Ball, was released on March 6, 2012. Three songs previously only available as live versions\u2014\"Wrecking Ball\", \"Land of Hope and Dreams\", and \"American Land\"\u2014appear on the album. The anthemic up-tempo rocker, \"We Take Care Of Our Own\"  is the album's lead single. It finds The Boss singing of patriotism and brotherhood and decrying the broken promises of the government. \"Wherever this flag's flown, we take care of our own,\" he croons. The song was released on January 19, 2012.\n\nSpringsteen released his eighteenth studio album, High Hopes, on January 14, 2014. The first single and music video was a newly recorded version of the song \"High Hopes\", which Springsteen had previously recorded in 1995. The album was the first by Springsteen in which all songs are either cover songs, newly recorded outtakes from previous records, or newly recorded versions of songs previously released. The 2014 E Street Band touring lineup, along with deceased E Street Band members Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici, appears on the album along with guitarist Tom Morello.\n\nE Street Band\n\nThe E Street Band is considered to have started in October 1972, even though it was not officially known as such until September 1974. The E Street Band was inactive from the end of 1988 through early 1999, except for a brief reunion in 1995.\n\nCurrent members\n\n    * Bruce Springsteen - lead vocals, guitar, harmonica, piano\n    * Garry Tallent - bass guitar, tuba\n    * Max Weinberg - drums, percussion (joined September 1974)\n    * Roy Bittan - piano, synthesizer (joined September 1974)\n    * Steven Van Zandt - lead guitar, mandolin, backing vocals (officially joined July 1975 after playing in previous bands; left in 1984 to go solo; rejoined in early 1995) Steven Van Zandt \n    * Nils Lofgren - guitar, pedal steel guitar, backing vocals (replaced Steven Van Zandt in June 1984; remained in group after Van Zandt returned)\n    * Patti Scialfa - backing and duet vocals, acoustic guitar, percussion (joined June 1984; became Springsteen's wife in 1991; they have a daughter and two sons)\n    * Soozie Tyrell - violin, acoustic guitar, percussion, backing vocals (joined 2002, occasional appearances before that)\n\nFormer members\n\n    * Vinnie 'Mad Dog' Lopez - drums (inception through February 1974, when asked to resign)\n    * David Sancious - keyboards (June 1973 to August 1974)\n    * Ernest 'Boom' Carter - drums (February to August 1974)\n    * Suki Lahav - violin, backing vocals (September 1974 to March 1975)\n    * Danny Federici - organ, electronic glockenspiel, accordion, other keyboards (on medical leave of absence from late November 2007, temporarily replaced by Charles Giordano) (Danny passed away on April 17, 2008 after a battle with cancer.) \n    * Clarence Clemons - saxophone, percussion, backing vocals, larger-than-life persona and Springsteen foil. Clarence Clemons passed away on on June 18, 2011, of complications from a stroke.\n\nFilm connections\n\nSpringsteen's music has long been intertwined with film. It made its first appearance in the 1983 John Sayles' film Baby, It's You, which featured several songs from Born to Run. The relationship Springsteen established with Sayles would re-surface in later years, with Sayles directing videos for songs from Born in the U.S.A. and Tunnel of Love. The song \"(Just Around the Corner to the) Light of Day\" was written for the early Michael J. Fox/Joan Jett vehicle Light of Day. His work has been used in films (winning him an Oscar for his song \"Streets of Philadelphia\"). Additionally his 1995 song \"Secret Garden\" appeared on the soundtrack for the Tom Cruise film Jerry Maguire.\n\nIn turn, films have been inspired by his music, including The Indian Runner, written and directed by Sean Penn, which Penn has specifically noted as being inspired by Springsteen's song \"Highway Patrolman\". He was nominated for a second Oscar for \"Dead Man Walkin'\", from the movie Dead Man Walking. In addition, \"Lift Me Up\" ran over the credits for the John Sayles film Limbo.\n\nBruce also made a cameo appearance in the John Cusack film High Fidelity. In the film, Cusack's character, Rob, imagines Springsteen giving him advice on his fractured love life.\n\nDiscography\n\n    Main article: Bruce Springsteen discography\n\n    * 1973: Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.\n    * 1973: The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle\n    * 1975: Born to Run\n    * 1978: Darkness on the Edge of Town\n    * 1980: The River\n    * 1982: Nebraska\n    * 1984: Born in the U.S.A.\n    * 1987: Tunnel of Love\n    * 1992: Human Touch\n    * 1992: Lucky Town\n    * 1995: The Ghost of Tom Joad\n    * 2002: The Rising\n    * 2005: Devils & Dust\n    * 2006: We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions\n    * 2007: Magic\n    * 2009: Working on a dream\n    * 2012: Wrecking Ball\n    * 2014: High Hopes\n\nSamples\n\n    * Download sample of \"Badlands\" from Darkness on the Edge of Town\n    * Download sample of \"Thunder Road\" from Born to Run.\n    * Download sample of \"Dancing in the Dark\" from Born in the U.S.A.\nAwards and recognition\n\nGrammy Awards\n\n    Springsteen has won 15 Grammy Awards, as follows (years shown are the year the award was given for, not the year in which the ceremony was held):\n\n    * Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male, 1984, \"Dancing in the Dark\"\n    * Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male, 1987, \"Tunnel of Love\"\n    * Song of the Year, 1994, \"Streets of Philadelphia\"\n    * Best Rock Song, 1994, \"Streets of Philadelphia\"\n    * Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo, 1994, \"Streets of Philadelphia\"\n    * Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television, 1994, \"Streets of Philadelphia\"\n    * Best Contemporary Folk Album, 1996, The Ghost of Tom Joad\n    * Best Rock Album, 2002, The Rising\n    * Best Rock Song, 2002, \"The Rising\"\n    * Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, 2002, \"The Rising\"\n    * Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, 2003, \"Disorder in the House\" (with Warren Zevon)\n    * Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance, 2004, \"Code of Silence\"\n    * Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance, 2005, \"Devils & Dust\"\n    * Best Traditional Folk Album, 2006, The Seeger Sessions: We Shall Overcome\n    * Best Long Form Music Video, 2006, \"Wings For Wheels: The Making Of Born to Run\"\n\nOnly one of these awards has been one of the cross-genre \"major\" ones (Song, Record, or Album of the Year); he has been nominated a number of other times for the majors, but failed to win.\n\nAcademy Awards\n\n    * Academy Award for Best Song, 1993, \"Streets of Philadelphia\" from Philadelphia\n\nEmmy Awards\n\n    * The Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band: Live In New York City HBO special won two technical Emmy Awards in 2001.\n\nOther recognition\n\n    * Polar Music Prize in 1997.\n    * Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, 1999\n    * Inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, 1999\n    * \"Born to Run\" named \"The unofficial youth anthem of New Jersey\" by the New Jersey state legislature (something Springsteen always found to be ironic, considering that the song \"is about leaving New Jersey\")\n    * The minor planet 23990, discovered Sept. 4 1999 by I.

The song was one of Wings\u2019 most successful singles, and the most successful Bond theme to that point. Commissioned specifically for the movie and credited to Paul McCartney and his wife Linda, it reunited McCartney with Beatles producer George Martin, who both produced the song and arranged the orchestral break. \n\nAlthough the most famous version of the song remains Wings\u2019 original recording, it was covered by the Stan Kenton big band in 1973 and later by Guns N\u2019 Roses in 1991.

British pop singer Geri Halliwell, of the Spice Girls, released the song as a b-side track for her solo number one single Lift Me Up, in November 1999. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+McCartney/_/Live+and+Let+Die\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It reached the tenth place in Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100. McCartney played all the instruments on the song. \n\nThe music video was directed by British director Phil Griffin. McCartney enters an elegant hall, where a group of black-dressed and very similar female dancers walk around. He meets his doppelg\u00e4nger, who starts dancing with the others while singing the song. The two McCartneys meet up two more times. At the end, McCartney is left alone in the middle of the room, bends on his knee and fades away slowly.

Like the rest of the album, the song had a minimalist synthesized feel to it. It featured humorously-processed lead vocals from McCartney, who played all the instruments and shared harmonies with wife Linda.\n\"Coming Up\" is also well known for its video. It is an early example of electronic trickery, with Paul McCartney playing ten roles and Linda McCartney playing two. The \"band\" (identified as \"The Plastic Macs\" on the drum kit) features Paul and Linda's imitations of various rock musician stereotypes, as well as a few identifiable musicians. In his audio commentary on the 2007 video collection The McCartney Years, McCartney identified the four characters that were impersonations of specific artists: Hank Marvin (guitarist from The Shadows), Ron Mael of Sparks (keyboards), the drummer, who was \"taken vaguely on John Bonham, even though he doesn't really look like him,\" and a 'Beatlemania-Era' version of himself. While others such as author Fred Bronson have suggested that there are other identifiable impersonations in the video, such as Andy MacKay, Frank Zappa and Neil Young[1], McCartney said the other roles were simply comic relief. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+McCartney/_/Coming+Up\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

McCartney is a multiple Grammy Award- and Academy Award-winning English singer-songwriter, poet, composer, multi-instrumentalist, entrepreneur, record producer, film producer, painter, and animal rights and peace activist. He gained worldwide fame as a member of The Beatles, alongside John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. McCartney and Lennon formed one of the most influential and successful songwriting partnerships and wrote some of the most popular songs in the history of rock music. After leaving The Beatles in 1970, McCartney launched a successful solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda Eastman, and singer-songwriter Denny Laine. He has worked on film scores and classical and electronic music, released a large catalogue of songs as a solo artist, and taken part in projects to help international charities.\n\nMcCartney is listed in Guinness World Records as the most successful musician and composer in popular music history, with 60 gold discs and sales of 100 million singles. His song \"Yesterday\" (credited to Lennon/McCartney, but composed entirely by McCartney) is listed as the most covered song in history\u2014by over 3,500 artists so far\u2014and has been played more than 7,000,000 times on American television and radio. Wings' 1977 single \"Mull of Kintyre\" became the first single to sell more than two million copies in the UK, and remains the UK's top selling non-charity single. According to britishhitsongwriters.com, he is the most successful songwriter in UK singles chart history, based on weeks that his compositions have spent on the chart.\n\nFollowing the death of his first wife Linda in 1998, McCartney married Heather Mills in 2002. They divorced in 2008. McCartney now has Nancy Shevell as his partner. McCartney practices meditation, sometimes still using the mantra that the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi gave him when The Beatles went to a transcendental meditation seminar in 1967. McCartney is an advocate for animal rights, vegetarianism, and music education; he is active in campaigns against landmines, seal hunting, and Third World debt. He is a keen football fan, supporting both Everton and Liverpool football clubs. His company MPL Communications owns the copyrights to more than 3,000 songs, including all of the songs written by Buddy Holly, along with the publishing rights to such musicals as Guys and Dolls, A Chorus Line, and Grease. McCartney is one of Britain's wealthiest men, with an estimated fortune of \u00a3750 million ($1.2 billion) in 2009.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Paul+McCartney\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The single's B-side contains \"Modern Girls & Old Fashion Men\", where lead singer Julian Casablancas duets with Regina Spektor. The official release date was delayed slightly after Casablancas objected to the song being credited as \"The Strokes and Regina Spektor\", claiming that it should read \"by Regina Spektor & The Strokes\".\n\nThe title \"Reptilia\" refers to the \"Reptilian complex\", the central part of one's brain that handles basic emotions such as love and hate.\n\nThe cover of the single features the artwork from the cabinet of the 1980 arcade game Centipede by Atari.\n\nThe music video for the song was their first that was not directed by Roman Coppola. Instead they chose Jake Scott to shoot the video, which features close shots of the band members' faces and hands while performing the song. At the end of the video, Julian Casablancas spits at the camera lens.\n\nThe song is a playable track in the video games Rock Band and in Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. The minor difference is that the overexposed effect on Casablancas' vocals is removed. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Strokes/_/Reptilia\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The 7\" vinyl includes \"I'll Try Anything Once\", performed by Julian Casablancas on the keyboard. The music video for \"Heart in a Cage\" was directed by Samuel Bayer, and was shot in New York City. It was shot in black and white and featured the band members playing in various locations in the city, such as on tall skyscrapers, or, in singer Julian Casablancas's case, the pavement.

This revolutionary guitar sound propelled the Kinks into stardom with the global smash hits \u00a0\u00a0\u2018You Really Got Me\u2019 and &#39;All Day and All of the Night&#39;, followed by numerous other classics over the next decades.<p>\u201c<em><strong>You Really Got Me and All Day and All of the Night\u00a0</strong></em> were predecessors of the whole three-chord guitar genre,\u201d says musicologist Joe Harrington. \u201cThe Kinks were one of the bands responsible for turning rock &#39;n&#39; roll into rock.&quot;<p>&quot;As lead guitarist and co-founder of the Kinks, <strong>Dave Davies</strong> is one of the most unpredictable and original forces in rock,\u201d enthuses writer Bill Crowley.<p>\u201cHis distinctive guitar style went on to have major impact on several key guitar-rock styles, including heavy metal and punk. \u00a0A Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, Dave&#39;s massive guitar sounds have inspired bands from Van Halen to Green Day.&quot;<p>Since the early 1960s, Dave has worked on a great number of critically acclaimed records, ranging from solo hit song <em><strong>Death of a Clown</strong></em>, to experimental Kinks records like <em><strong>Village Green Preservation Society and Arthur</strong></em> and the classic song <em><strong>Lola</strong></em> in 1970. Dave further helped shape the sound of the Kinks with his singing and lead guitar on songs such as \u201cCome On Now\u201d and the anthemic \u201cI\u2019m Not Like Everybody Else\u201d. Dave\u2019s solo output continued from the 60s to the 70s and 80s with hits like, \u201cSusannah\u2019s Still Alive\u201d and tracks on Kinks records like \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know My Name\u201d, \u201cStrangers\u201d and \u201cTrust Your Heart\u201d. The 80s saw the release of spiritually minded AFL-13606, which featured the wonderful \u201cImagination\u2019s Real\u201d. Other albums to follow were Glamour and Chosen People. \u00a0Mainstream success continued with the hit Kinks albums <em><strong>Low Budget</strong></em> and <em><strong>State of Confusion</strong></em>, as they re-attained the commercial success they previously had in America in the mid-60s, before they were unfairly banned for 4 years.<p>In the 1990s Dave released the solo album, <em><strong>Bug</strong></em> and the compilation <em><strong>Unfinished Business</strong></em>. His songs have been featured in films by John Carpenter and Wes Anderson, who featured <em><strong>Strangers</strong></em> in <em><strong>Darjeeling Limited</strong></em> (the song has been covered by many artists including Norah Jones). One of Dave`s most popular Kinks songs <em><strong>Living on a Thin Line</strong></em> was used in the HBO\u2019s &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.\u00a0 \u00a0<p>His autobiography <em><strong>Kink</strong></em> was well received in the late 1990s. \u00a0In 2010 he worked with son Russell Davies to create the hauntingly beautiful rock electronica album, <em><strong>The Aschere Project</strong></em>. \u00a0Dave is currently working with another of his sons, Martin, on their second documentary film <em><strong>Strangers</strong></em>, as well as a forthcoming solo album in addition to another album with Russ Davies - &quot;Open Road&quot;.<p>A BBC documentary about Dave, <em><strong>Kinkdom Kome\u00a0</strong></em> came out in 2011. Dave&#39;s 2013 album <em><strong>I Will Be Me</strong></em> on Cleopatra Records, showed a return to his groundbreaking guitar sound and songwriting. In 2013 Dave Davies also returned to touring after a long hiatus. He had spent the past decade recuperating from a life-threatening stroke. In 2014, Dave released a meditation book called Heal about his recovery in which he had to learn to walk, talk and play guitar again. His amazing return to playing live and touring in the U.S. was a triumph both creatively and spiritually as he found new inspiration for his album <em><strong>Rippin Up Time</strong></em>. Released to great critical acclaim in 2014 on Sony&#39;s Red River Entertainment label, followed up by the live album \u00a0<em><strong>Rippin Up New York City</strong></em> also on Sony&#39;s Red River Entertainment label.<p>A long-time inductee of the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame, Dave Davies expresses the power, sensitivity, magnetism and creative expression of a seasoned yet spontaneous rock-n-roll visionary.\u00a0\u00a0<p>Writer Greg Antoniono best sums up Dave Davies` massive contribution to rock `n` roll:<p>\u201cThe reason he&#39;s my favorite guitarist (not to mention singer and songwriter) is that he is the best at three difficult and different things: first, -soloing, which is typically the gauge of great guitarists, but he does something even harder than being flashy just for the sake of being flashy, he crafts solos that are melodic, powerful (when they need to be) and memorable that fit the song like they were written into it. Second, Dave plays riffs/chords behind the vocal (like &quot;No More Looking Back&quot;) that enhance the song - amazingly hard to do (name another guitarist who does it as well!), and third, his intro riffs and licks set up the song so you want to hear the rest of the song. He&#39;s the most complete rock guitarist bar none. And this is in addition to coming up with the legendary power chords that gave us heavy rock and roll! And I&#39;ve been playing for 41 years and I still am in awe of his creativity.\u201c</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>", "title": "Dave Davies", "url": "http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/dave-davies-/E0-001-110345809-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "City Winery - New York", "date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00"}, {"city": "Dover", "description": " This interactive class will help clinical staff explain best practices\u00a0for the emergency and acute management of stroke.

The band rose to fame in the early 2000s as a leading group in garage rock/post-punk revival. The band consists of Julian Casablancas (lead vocals), Nick Valensi (lead guitar), Albert Hammond, Jr. (rhythm guitar), Nikolai Fraiture (bass guitar) and Fabrizio Moretti (drums and percussion).\n\t \nUpon the release of their debut album, Is This It, in 2001, the group was met with much critical acclaim, being hailed by some as the \"saviors of rock and roll.\" NME made Is This It their Album of the Year. Since then, the band has maintained a large fan base, notably in the UK, US and Australia. As of 2007, Is This It has sold over 3.5 million copies worldwide.\n\t \nThey released their second album Room on Fire in October 2003, to good reviews, but to less success commercially, although it still went gold. The album's sound maintained the Strokes' familiar reference points, while also evoking groups such as The Cars, Bob Marley, and Blondie. In the process, they made the cover of Spin Magazine for the second time, with each member receiving his own cover. They also made the cover of Rolling Stone for the first time. Additional media coverage of the band came from the relationship between Moretti and actress Drew Barrymore, which ended in January 2007.\n\t \nIn late September 2005, \"Juicebox\", the first single from The Strokes then unreleased third album, was leaked online, forcing the single's release date to be advanced. The single was then released as an exclusive on online download services. \"Juicebox\" became The Strokes' second UK Top 10 hit, as well as their second US Modern Rock Top 10 success. During November and December 2005 the Strokes did a promotional tour for the still unreleased album, which involved doing one-off shows in major cities around the world.\n\nTheir third album, First Impressions of Earth, was released in January 2006 to mixed reviews and debuted at number four in the US and number one in the UK, a first for the band. In Japan it went gold within the first week of release. It was also the most downloaded album for two weeks on iTunes. Fraiture claimed that the album was \"like a scientific breakthrough\". In January 2006, the band then made their second appearance on Saturday Night Live playing \"Juicebox\" and \"You Only Live Once\".\n\t \nThe Strokes' frontman Julian Casablancas and guitarist Nick Valensi started writing new material for their band's forthcoming new album in the latter stages of January 2009, which they were set to go in the studio to finalize in February of the same year. In February 2010, Julian Casablancas told NME that the band's fourth album was set to be released in September 2010.

It was released as the group's debut single in September 2010, and the following year was included on their EP Foster the People and their debut album, Torches. \"Pumped Up Kicks\" became the group's breakthrough hit and was one of the most popular songs of 2011. The song was written and recorded by frontman Mark Foster while he was working as a commercial jingle writer. Contrasting with the upbeat musical composition, the lyrics describe the homicidal thoughts of a troubled youth.\n\nThe track received considerable attention after it was posted online in 2010 as a free download, and it helped the group garner a multi-album record deal with Columbia Records imprint Startime International. \"Pumped Up Kicks\" proved to be a sleeper hit; in 2011, after receiving significant airplay on modern rock stations, the song crossed-over onto contemporary hit radio stations. The song spent eight consecutive weeks at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States, making it the first Billboard Alternative Songs number-one single to crack the U.S. top 5 since Kings of Leon's \"Use Somebody\" in 2009. The song was widely praised by critics, and it has been licensed for use in a wide range of popular media since its release. \"Pumped Up Kicks\" received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foster+the+People/_/Pumped+Up+Kicks\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

My old man turned me on to Hank Williams when I was 3 or 4 years old, and the radio has been my best friend ever since. As i got a little older, i got into all kinds of music. You name it, and i listened to itand actually learned to love it all. To each his own though and for me it was outlaw country and southern rock. Uncle Hop, I guess, was the one who turned me on to all that. He had all the Waylon Jennings you could stand, and i could stand a heap. Somewhere, in that time I got a Hank Williams jr. album and thats when I really got turned on. I guess you could say I&#39;ve done my fair share of making him a rich man. He is my biggest influence, no doubt..but Willie, Waylon, Skynyrd, Steve Earle, Marshall Tucker, Allman Brothers, Black Crowes, and so many more have influenced me tremendously. As far as my personal music goes, i guess it was kind of a surprise to everyone, including me. A guitar fell in my lap during my junior year of college and changed my life.

Roddy Walston and The Businessset to be releasedSeptember 29 via ATO Records, JRWATBpursued a brighter, more nuanced sound that teased out the bands latent pop sensibilities without skimping on energy or attitude. As you press play on the opening track You Know Me Better, anthemic guitars scream out of buoyant, hooky lyricsas Walstons chugging piano supplies a persistent heartbeat. The bar band sound of the past has been replaced by an aspirational, booming cacophony that could fill stadiums. Instead of the raucous bombast JRWATB manifested on their breakout hit album Essential Tremors, the bands leader had certain rules he was determined to followon Destroyers of the Soft Life. Onewas:Speak/sing clearly, no hiding behind mumbles. Another was,D.I.Y. but hi-fi record ourselves as much as possible but have it sound amazing and full.The final, most important, rule was, Nostalgia is a cancer acknowledge that you are in the present. We had never been a band where we pretended that its 1965, Walston says. But we ended up in situations with our records where those rules were imposed on us.On Essential Tremors, JRWATBinspired pangs of joy in music fans that yearn for the days of Bob Seger and early Bruce Springsteen. But when Walston returned homefrom touring in 2015and began contemplating his next move, he no longer felt the same connection to that classic-rock sound.Loud rock and roll music has become less relevant because its just been on a loop, he says. If there was any rule on this record, it was, lets be a part of music right now. I want to be part of living music in this moment.Helping the band realize a new vision for its music was veteran producer Phil Ek (Built To Spill, Father John Misty, Fleet Foxes), who came in to apply some finishing touches after JRWATBcompleted most of the record in Virginia. The thing with Phil is he is a servant of the song and that is my vibe as well, Walston says. Ego has no place in songwriting or the studio and we hit it off in that respect right away.Is there any point to making a record that has real instruments (guitars, drums, piano etc.) right now? he continues. Is there anything left to be said by writing this way? Do albums matter anymore? Can I make something that I care about right now because its a manifestation of the fear/love/excitement/ I am feeling right now, not because is tickles some easy to reach nostalgic pleasure center.Lead single The Wanting boasts a shimmering, uplifting guitar riff and an impossibly huge chorus that belies the songs thoughtful exploration of familial relationships and the fallacy of distilling complicated people down to archetypes. Did you do right by us/ best it could be, Walston sings,addressing a prodigal father figure.Youve done no harm/ but youve been no good to me.Throughout Destroyers of the Soft LifeJRWATBsimilarly melds engaging, melodic songwriting with sharp observations about American culture that take on a new kind of power in light of the 2016 presidential election. Standout tracks such as the infectious Ways And Means and swaggering Blade Of Truth offer the uncompromised, salt-of-the-Earth perspective of a songwriter who grew up among the white working class and yet has enough perspective to see the ways in which those people have undermined themselves in the political realm. As Walston sings in Blade of Truth, there is now a judgement on the herd/ and your privilege will burn.Amid the torn-from-the-headlines commentary, Walston revisits the same question: Is the truth a hard line, or it is a flexible line that can be messed with?I got to straddle the line a bit with this record, he says. I hit a point in my life where I could pay my bills on time for the first time ever, and take a breath. I got to see the life you can have when youre not living a life of desperation. But I was just outside that line of desperation.The bandsnewfound financial security is largely the result of the bands hard work on the road. Looking back on the tour cycle for Essential Tremors, Walston can only chuckle. We probably toured on it way longer than our contemporaries would, headmits. Of course, not many bands experience the sort of growth in prominence and audience size that Walston and his compatriots have witnessedin the past severalyears. Road warriors from the time they formed in 2002, JRWATB has long been an underground favorite, toiling away in clubs and bars and carving out its own niche outside of the rock mainstream. But the radio success of Essential Tremors opened new doors and fostered exciting opportunities, including invites to Lollapalooza, the Newport Folk Festival, and Bonnaroo, and a featured slot in an episode of the prestigious music TV institution,Austin City Limits. With every new experience came requests to play more shows. Thetrain just kept rolling, Walston says, until finally he hit a wall. By the time I came off the road, I thought, Im toast. I dont have anything in the tank.Walstons world was also rocked by a huge life-changing event the birth of his first child. I think having a kid made me care less of what people think of me, he says. I have one ultimate mission right now keep a human alive. I dont care if someone doesnt like my pants or my hair or whatever. Being a parent makes you powerful in that way.Over the next year and a half, Walston committed to building himself and his band back upinto a new kind of rock n roll beast. But before JRWATBcould get started on its fourth album, Walston decided to do some literal construction on a new space for the band where it could rehearse and record. The only space available in the bands hometown of Richmond, Va. hardly seemed promising it was a completely annihilated warehouse that had been a grenade factory during World War II, says Walston, who decided to rent the place after the landlord offeredthe first two months rent for free. Perhaps the landlord expected JRWATB to eventually packup and retreat. But that guy clearly knows nothing about this bands work ethic, or affinity for lost causes. Insteadof giving up, they gutted the place and spent the next seven months rehabbing the building until it was transformed into a suitable headquarters for JRWATB. Why go to all the trouble of making your own space when there are any number of established studios where you can make your record? For JRWATB, like it is with so many things in their lives, building a personal studio was a matter of principle. When youre renting studio time, its always somebody elses time. For once, Walston wanted to make a record on his time. I dont listen to our old records because I get so stressed when I think about making them, he says, reflecting on how rushed the band was in the studioback then. Were taking the experience back.&quot;", "title": "J Roddy Walston And The Business", "url": "http://cleveland.eventful.com/events/j-roddy-walston-and-business-/E0-001-109959075-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "The Grog Shop", "date": "2018-02-03 21:00:00"}, {"city": "Belmont", "description": " Join foster care expert, Dr. John DeGarmo, as he allows foster parents to REFRESH!

The Strypes are a proper phenomenon. Four boys aged 15 and 17, they are players with chops way beyond their years, the hard-earned result of years spent honing their craft in Irish pubs, hotels and music halls, where they&#39;d often play for up to two and a half hours at a time. &quot;The Irish pub band ethos is play for really long, or you&#39;re no good,&quot; says guitarist Josh. &quot;And sometimes there&#39;d be five people there, and they&#39;d just want to hear play &#39;Whiskey In The Jar&#39;,&quot; says drummer Evan. &quot;So we developed a trick to make them pay attention -- we play really LOUD!&quot;Bassist Pete O&#39;Hanlon, drummer Evan Walsh and guitarist Josh McClorey have known each other as long as they can remember, growing up together in Cavan, a small, pleasant, working class town near the border with Northern Ireland. And for just as long, they&#39;ve been delving into the record collections of their parents.It&#39;s in the black plastic grooves of their parents&#39; LPs that they became fans of a series of artists not commonly discussed among their peers: Doctor Feelgood and Dave Edmunds, Howlin&#39; Wolf and Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters and &#39;Baby Face&#39; Leroy Foster. They can talk at great length -- and frothy enthusiasm -- about all of them. &quot;We started off listening to Stiff Records and The Stones and the &#39;60s bands, then it was listen to this, listen to this, and then it kind of went back to the &#39;50s -- and then the &#39;40s, &#39;30s and &#39;20s...,&quot; says Ross.They&#39;re not retro snobs -- they like Jack White, The Black Keys, Arctic Monkeys, Jake Bugg, Miles Kane and more -- but they do place themselves in direct opposition to the X Factor artists and manufactured pop. &quot;The X Factor is not about people wanting to be an artist and share music, it&#39;s just get rich quick, 15 minutes of fame,&quot; says bassist Pete. &quot;There&#39;s no artist satisfaction -- it&#39;s just going through the motions of getting famous for a couple of months or years. It&#39;s artificial.&quot;In falling in love with this music, they started doing what generations of blues lovers did before them -- playing the music themselves, assembling into a crack guitar, bass and drums formation. Singer Ross Farrelly was the last to join, recruited after he appeared solo on the same bill as the band. He donned his trademark Ray Ban shades at his first group performance and the image stuck. &quot;It started because I was nervous -- I wore them so I wouldn&#39;t be able to see anybody,&quot; he says. &quot;Then it just became a thing -- I become a completely different person on stage.&quot;The Strypes&#39; days of gigging around Ireland in a converted disabled access van eventually got them noticed. They landed slots on The Late, Late Show, they started touring overseas and -- thanks to their snappy dressing -- they caught the attention of A&R from Elton John&#39;s management company. &quot;He first spotted us walking through a Tube station,&quot; says Pete.The three elder members of the band quit school after their Junior Certs last summer. Singer Ross is still theoretically a schoolboy, but the band&#39;s whirlwind year has been a major distraction. As 2012 went on, things became increasingly surreal. Elton John personally called to talk about signing them. Squeeze songwriter Chris Difford signed on as a mentor. Towards the end of 2012, Noel Gallagher turned up to see them play, they met Jeff Beck and Paul Weller invited them to support him, later saying, &quot;I saw that band The Strypes recently and it was just, &#39;Wow&#39;. The guitarist is fucking amazing. Really raised my game that did.&quot;The band have already met their musical heroes -- and they aren&#39;t phased by it at all. &quot;Everyone&#39;s really normal,&quot; says Josh. &quot;I think it&#39;s the best part about them. It&#39;s just like meeting anyone, but they&#39;re just really lovely and genuine and they have HUGE talent.&quot;With most of them, the band have something in common -- a deep love for the blues. It&#39;s why the band play a hefty set of covers by artists little-known outside of those in the know. &quot;They&#39;re fantastic songs and it&#39;s part of carrying on the blues tradition -- not just covering songs but reinterpreting them and letting people hear them,&quot; says Pete. &quot;It feels like it&#39;s a mission of sorts -- not to educate because that sounds like a superiority thing -- but to let people know there&#39;s a lot of good music out there if you want to listen to it.&quot;Now signed to Mercury Records, The Strypes are setting about preparing their debut album, and writing new material to add to live favourites &#39;Mystery Man&#39; and &#39;Blue Collar Jane&#39;. &quot;The album will be a mix of covers and our own material,&quot; says Evan. &quot;And it&#39;ll be loud.&quot;Despite their age, despite the whirlwind excitement surrounding them, the band are keeping their feet on the ground for now. &quot;There&#39;s a lot of bullshit associated with the celebrity aspect of the music business, all the drink and drugs and the rest of it, but we&#39;re just more interested in being around music,&quot; says Pete. &quot;There&#39;s a bit of interest now we&#39;re signed and all but if that didn&#39;t happen we&#39;d still be playing small gigs in Cavan,&quot; says Josh. &quot;We don&#39;t care if we&#39;re not famous -- we just want to play rhythm and blues.&quot;", "title": "The Strypes", "url": "http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/strypes-/E0-001-107962981-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Mercury Lounge", "date": "2018-03-26 18:30:00"}, {"city": "Washington", "description": " DC127\u2019s Foster Care and Adoption Information Night is for anyone interested in learning more about the process of fostering and adopting through foster care in Washington, DC.

So come alone, bring that special someone, or a really good friend because this is where you will want to be on Feb 10.\u00a0 P.S.\u00a0 Wear RED!! So what included in the ticket? Entry to the event, a 3 hour hosted reception, passed appetizers, and a guaranteed good time!! I&#39;ve been producing charity events for 8 years so you can believe that!! Want a Table? Get early access for you and you guests with express entry if you decide to be fashionably late. ;) Plus you don&#39;t have to worry about going to the bar because you already have a home base. Probably the best thing is having somewhere to sit. But beware because tables always go fast so grab yours quickly because you get to pick your seating by the order tables are purchased. Trivia &quot;Why do a charity event having to do with Brains anyways?&quot; Well the whole reason why I started doing charity events was because of a Brain Tumor that I found out I had 6 years ago. It was scary but I had my family and friends around me the whole time. I do get the pleasure of looking at a nice dent and my forehead and a fancy scar so that I can remember my experience. Not everyone has a happy ending like I did. And to be honest, I didnt even know anything was wrong with me except for some vision issues and headaches. My boss made me go to the doctor!! Awareness to these types of issues is what saves lives. The Brain Injury Association of Illinois (BIA of IL) is a not-for-profit, statewide membership organization comprised of people with brain injuries, family members, friends and professionals. BIA of IL is part of a network of brain injury associations across the United States, and is a subsidiary of the national Brain Injury Association, Inc. (BIA) which was founded in 1980.

This is when he said \"Use Somebody\" was written, he credited the writing of the song to the City of Glasgow and the audience at the SECC on that night.\n\nThe single received heavy airplay in Scandinavia, such as in Finland and Sweden, as well as the Republic of Ireland, UK and Australia, where it has remained at number one on the Official Airplay Chart for six consecutive weeks. It was a huge success in the U.S., where it topped multiple airplay formats, and reached #4 on the Hot 100 and the top of the Pop Songs chart.\n\n\"Use Somebody\" debuted in the UK Singles Chart at #29 via download sales alone on September 28, 2008, the same date as its parent album, just six days after the album's release and two weeks after the #1 single \"Sex on Fire\" charted. Despite falling to #50 over the next month, on November 23 the single became Kings of Leon's fifth single to enter the UK Top 20, charting at #17 and rising to #15 the following week. On December 7, 2008, the day before its physical release, it marked only the band's second UK Top 10 single, climbing to #10. The following week (its first week of physical release), it looked to have continued the band's surge to success. As the follow up to Sex on Fire, it became their second UK Top 3 single, peaking at #2. It remained in the UK Top 10 for 13 non-consecutive weeks and spent an unbroken 40 weeks on the Top 75, only dropping out due to the surge in sales of Michael Jackson titles immediately after his death. However, a week later it was back, and has now spent 60 weeks on the Top 75 (just two behind Sex on Fire and making it the 6th longest runner of all time), and 62 on the Top 100. To date, the single has sold over 700,000 copies in the UK, and Kings of Leon have become the first and only act to place two singles on the chart for an entire year, and currently the only act to have 2 songs in the top ten of the UK's longest running songs of all time.\n\nIn the United States, \"Use Somebody\" has become a huge hit, and the band's mainstream breakthrough. It has peaked at #4 on the Hot 100, giving the band their first top five hit there. On U.S. radio, the song was a multi-format smash, becoming just the fourth song in history to top the Mainstream Top 40, Adult Top 40, Alternative Songs, and Triple A charts. The three prior being \"Slide\" by the Goo Goo Dolls, \"Every Morning\" by Sugar Ray, and \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" by Green day. The song first reached #1 on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart (now called the \"Alternative\" chart), their second of three consecutive singles to top that chart. \"Use Somebody\" also reached #1 on the Adult Top 40 Chart, and later topped the Mainstream Top 40 as well. \"Use Somebody\" has also found great digital success, so far selling over 2,512,122 digital downloads in the United States.\n\nAccording to the Use Somebody Songfacts, Caleb Followill Caleb wrote this song as an apology to his bandmates after a drunken fight. He came up with the tune by speeding up  Joe Cocker and  Jennifer Warne 's Oscar-winning theme song to 1983 movie An Officer and a Gentleman  during a soundcheck in Scotland.\n\nThe song has received generally positive reviews from music critics. Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly called \"Use Somebody\" a highlight of the album, describing the song as \"a too-cool hipster's cry for comfort.\" Nick Levine of Digital Spy said \"with its Springsteen-style 'oooah-woooah's, gathering storm of guitars and lusty, longing vocals from Caleb Followill, it's nearly as infectious as 'Sex on Fire.'\" Gavin Haynes of NME praised the song as \"easily the best 80s power ballad of 2008,\" but cautioned that the band \"may be in danger of mistaking bluster for brilliance.\"\n\nCover versions:\nMargaret Durante released a version of this song to country radio as a single.\n\nAmerican band Paramore and British musician Bat For Lashes have both covered the song on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge.\n\nOn their Dark Horse Tour, Nickelback performed a cover of the song live, and guitarist Ryan Peake sang lead vocals instead of Chad Kroeger.\n\nPixie Lott, VV Brown and Friendly Fires have performed cover versions of the song, of which Pixie Lott's version peaked at number 52 in the UK Singles Chart, due to it being a B-side to her number 1 single \"Mama Do (Uh Oh Uh Oh)\"\n\nTiki Taane formerly of Salmonella Dub performed a live acoustic version on Triple J's morning show, for their weekly segment 'like a version'.\nBrazilian band NX Zero covered the song on the TV show The Edgard Show on Multishow.\n\nFormer American Idol contestant, Brooke White, covered the song for her sophomore album, High Hopes & Heartbreak with a more folk sound.\n\n\nIn their UK tour with fellow Clubland artist Darren Styles, Liverpudlian dance troupe Ultrabeat recorded a version of the song, which is rumoured to appear on their second album\n\nKelly Clarkson covered the song, mashing it with an Alanis Morissette song 'That I Would Be Good' on her 2009 tour.\n\nA hip-hop version was crafted, featuring Houston rapper Trae.\n\nLaura Jansen covered the song on her album \"Bells.\"\n\nSteve Appleton covers a version of this song.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kings+of+Leon/_/Use+Somebody\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It's the opening track on their 2005 album Aha Shake Heartbreak. Lyrically, the song can be interpreted as the story of a boy at a party who has his eye on a girl (\"so far so good, she's absolutely wasted\"), and the events that take place as the night unfolds. The studio version of the song itself ends at approximately 2:40 and is followed by a piano driven, Latin/calypso-infused coda, which features Caleb Followill crooning:\n\n\"Rise and shine, all you gold-digger mothers / are you too good to tango with the poor, poor boys?\".\n\nThe [above] lines are performed during the intro of the music video to King of the Rodeo. In the video, however, it's performed by a group in a country-western style rather than the band's original Latin/calypso-infused coda style, possibly to reflect the band's southern roots. The Kings of Leon have rarely performed this final part of the song live. (live video from houston in 2006. LINK: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAsA1fXYoBY)\n\nIn recent concerts, the band has used the song to close their sets. When the band toured with Pearl Jam, as well as during Lollapalooza 2007, Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder would come out playing tambourines and sing the song alongside Caleb Followill, trading lines with the Kings of Leon lead singer. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kings+of+Leon/_/Slow+Night,+So+Long\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Leon Greening studied piano at Leeds College of Music and the Guildhall. His extraordinary solos, inspired by the likes of Wynton Kelly and Bud Powell, keep the audience on the edge of their seats and mark him out as one of the finest pianists this country has ever produced. His hard swinging style has made him a favourite on the UK Jazz circuit for well over a decade, and his intense performances have not only encouraged a loyal following but high praise from critics: &quot;Leon Greening....epitomises the assured confidence of a new generation.&#39;&quot; Jazz Journal &quot;Listening to Leon Greening&#39;s playing is like hearing a history of post-Bop piano.....authentic and yet personal echoes of (all the greats).....all the more remarkable for coming from a musician of such youth.&quot; Clark Tracey Christian Brewer is a well known jazz alto saxophonist / composer and educator on the London jazz scene. He has been a leading voice on the alto saxophone for over 20 years, and has performed at many of the top clubs and festivals both at home and abroad. &quot;One of the most exciting alto players I&#39;ve heard in a long time&quot; Tony Hall Bassist Adam King as a youngster started on the saxophone before moving to bass guitar and finally to the double bass on which he gained a 1st class honours degree in BA Jazz.

Steve Brown, always smiling, always swinging, and drummer with the Scott Hamilton quartet since 2000, studied in New York in the early 1990s.

Each member of the family group is known by their middle name (second given name) as opposed to their first given name.\n\nThe band's early music was an upbeat blend of southern rock and blues influences but the band has gradually expanded their sound to include a variety of genres, including alternative rock.\n\nKings of Leon achieved initial success in the United Kingdom with nine Top 40 singles, two BRIT Awards in 2008, and all three of the band's albums at the time peaking in the top five of the UK Albums Chart. Their third album Because of the Times also reached the number one spot. After the release of Only by the Night in 2008 they finally achieved chart success in their native United States. The singles Sex on Fire, Use Somebody and Notion peaked at number one on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks, while the album itself was their first ever platinum-selling album in the US. \n\nEarly years (1999\u20132002)\nThe three Followill brothers spent much of their youth traveling around the Southern United States with their father, Ivan \"Leon\" Followill, a traveling Pentecostal Church preacher and their mother, Betty-Ann, who taught them when they were not in school. Caleb and Jared were both born in Mt. Juliet, Tennessee, while Nathan and Matthew were born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. According to Rolling Stone magazine, \"While Leon preached at churches and tent revivals throughout the Deep South, the boys attended services and were occasionally enlisted to bang on some drums. They were either home-schooled or enrolled in small parochial schools at this time. Except for a five-year period when they settled in Jackson, Tennessee, the Followill's childhoods were spent driving through the south in a purple 1988 Oldsmobile, decamping for a week or two wherever Leon was scheduled to preach.\"\n\nWhen the boys' father resigned from the church and divorced his wife in 1997, the boys relocated to Nashville and embraced the rock music and lifestyle they had previously been denied. While there, they met songwriter Angelo Petraglia, who helped the siblings hone their songwriting skills and introduced them to the musical influences of the Rolling Stones, The Clash, and Thin Lizzy in particular. Six months later, Nathan and Caleb signed with RCA Records, who insisted that the duo recruit more members for the band before launching their career. The band was formed when cousin Matthew and younger brother Jared were asked to join. They named themselves Kings of Leon in honor of Nathan, Caleb, and Jared's father and grandfather, who were both named Leon.\n\nIn an interview, Caleb admitted to \"kidnapping\" their cousin Matthew from his hometown in Mississippi in order for him to join the band. They told his mother that he was just staying for a week, but they consequently never allowed him to return home. Drummer Nathan added, \"When we signed the deal with RCA, it was just me and Caleb. The label told us they were going to put a band together, but we said, 'We're going to buy our little brother a bass, he's a freshman in high school. Caleb will teach himself the guitar. Our cousin Matthew played guitar when he was 10 and I'll play drums.' The record label agreed,\". \n\nYouth and Young Manhood and Aha Shake Heartbreak (2003 - 2005)\nTheir first record, the Holy Roller Novocaine EP was released on February 18, 2003. At this stage, Jared was only 16 years old and had not yet learned to play the bass guitar. The release of Holy Roller Novocaine gave the Kings of Leon a significant amount of exposure prior to the release of their debut album, Youth and Young Manhood, receiving a 4/5 star rating from Rolling Stone magazine. Four of the five songs would later be released on Youth and Young Manhood, however the versions of Wasted Time and California Waiting on the EP differ, with the first having a more tense riff and different vocal style than the same track off Youth and Young Manhood, and the latter being recorded in a rush to finish the record. The EP contains the B-side Wicker Chair while another track titled Andrea, was discarded prior to its release. All the songs released on the EP were co-written by Angelo Petraglia who also produced the record.\n\nThe band's debut studio album, Youth and Young Manhood was released in the UK in July 2003, and in the United States in August of the same year. The album was recorded between Sound City Studios in Los Angeles and Shangri-La Studios in Malibu, California, with producer Ethan Johns (son of producer Glyn Johns who most notably worked with the Rolling Stones and the Eagles). The album received some critical notice domestically, but became a sensation in the UK and Ireland, where NME declared it \"one of the best debut album of the last 10 years\". Following the release of the album, Kings of Leon was chosen to tour with fellow American rock band The Strokes and U2.\n\nThe band's second album Aha Shake Heartbreak was released in the UK in October 2004 and in the United States in February 2005. Building on the southern-infused garage rock of their first album, the album broadened the band's domestic and international audience. The album was again produced by Angelo Petraglia and Ethan Johns. The Bucket, Four Kicks, and King of the Rodeo were all released as singles, with the \"The Bucket\" rising into the Top 20 in Britain. Taper Jean Girl was also used in the 2007 movie Disturbia and the movie Cloverfield in 2008. The band garnered accolades from several of their rock peers, including Elvis Costello, and also toured with Bob Dylan and Pearl Jam during 2005 and 2006.\n\nBecause of the Times (2006\u201307)\nIn March 2006, Kings of Leon were back in the studio with their producers Angelo Petraglia and Ethan Johns, working on their third album. Guitarist Matthew told NME: \"Man, we're sitting on a bunch of songs right now that we wish we could let the world hear\". The band's third album was titled Because of the Times, which may be a reference to a church ministers conference of the same name held at The Pentecostals of Alexandria church in Alexandria, Louisiana that the brothers often attended. The album showed a clear evolution from Kings of Leon's previous work, as the band's trademark dirty, southern-fried swagger was replaced with a more polished, clean-cut sound.\n\nThe album was released on April 2, 2007 in the UK, and a day later in the United States, preceded by the single On Call, which became a hit in Britain and Ireland. It debuted at number one in Britain and Ireland and entered the European charts at number twenty-five, selling approximately 70,000 copies in its first week of release. NME said that the album \"cements Kings of Leon as one of the great American bands of our times.\" and Entertainment Weekly called Because of the Times \"an epic wide-screen movie of a CD and the band's best to date.\" However, some critics found the album inferior to their previous efforts. Stylus Magazine rated it a C- and noted \"If they wanted us to take them serious this time around, they'd at least try to be right honest about their ascent into minor celebrity and not keep on with the yokel fa\u00e7ade. Without cautionary yarns regarding life on the tour bus or banging supermodels, the bright-eyed, legs-stretched mood of the music rings just as hollow.\" Dave Hood of Artrocker gave the album one star out of five, finding that \"Kings of Leon are experimenting, learning, and getting a bit lost.\" Pitchfork Media contended that \"Because of the Times sounds suspiciously like a counterattack on womankind, launched from somewhere in the mid-1990s, deep inside a bruised, stadium-sized ego.\"\n\nIn spite of the mixed recognition, the album spawned a number of hit singles in Europe, including Charmer and Fans, along with a number of crowd favorites such as Knocked Up and My Party.\n\nOnly by the Night (2008\u201309)\nAfter recording throughout most of 2008, \"the all American long haired rockers\" (The Times), released their fourth studio album Only by the Night on September 19, which subsequently entered the UK Albums Chart at number one and remained there for one more week. Only By The Night also had two single week stints as the UK #1 album in 2009, one directly after the BRIT Awards. In the United States, the album reached number 5 on the Billboard Charts. Reception to the album was the most polarized yet, with the British press granting the album glowing reviews. Q Magazine named Only by the Night \"Album of the Year\" for 2008. In the United States, reactions to the album were more mixed.

The album's popularity in Australia was confirmed with a total of four singles being voted into the world's largest online music poll, the \"Triple J Hottest 100\". The song Crawl came in at number 70, Closer was voted number 24 and \"Use Somebody\" finished number 3 in the poll. However, their biggest success from Only By The Night was \"Sex on Fire\" which was voted number 1 in the Hottest 100 poll for 2008 and number 90 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time, 2009 poll. \"Sex on Fire\" also won the band a Grammy Award at the 51st Grammy Awards held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on February 8, 2009.

The song \"Crawl\" from this album was released as a free download on the band's website on July 28. The third and fourth singles were Revelry, which peaked at number 19 in New Zealand and Notion, which peaked at number 24 in Belgian charts. Only By The Night was certified platinum in the United States by the RIAA for selling one million copies in less than a year after its release.\n\nIn 2009, the band headlined a number of music festivals, including Reading & Leeds, Rock Werchter, Oxegen, T In The Park, Gurtenfestival and Open'er Festival in Europe, along with Sasquatch, Lollapalooza, and Austin City Limits in the United States. That same year, the band won their first Grammy Award for the single \"Sex on Fire\", as well as two BRIT Awards for \"Best International Group\" and \"Best International Album.\" The album Only by the Night also won an NME Award for \"Album of the Year.\"\n\nFuture projects (2009-2011)\nThe band has announced the release of a live DVD on November 10, 2009 and a remix album due for release in the coming months, though the latter is untitled and unscheduled at the moment. The DVD was filmed at London's O2 Arena in July 2009. In an interview with Billboard.com drummer Nathan stated, \"England is really the first place we broke ... We figured what better place to make a live DVD than where the fans have been the craziest for the longest?\" The show featured some choice rarities, and Nathan continued by saying \"we just put the cameras in the back of our minds and acted like they weren't even there.\" The remix album came to life after Kings of Leon learned that other artists had started working on revisions of the band's songs. Mark Ronson, Kenna, Lykke Li with her cover of \"Knocked Up\", and Linkin Park are also contributing a remix to the album.\n\nOn October 17, 2009, the night of the final show of the US tour in Nashville, Tennessee, Nathan Followill posted \"Now it's time to start creating the next musical chapter in the novel that is Kings of Leon. Thanks again to all. Boomer fucking Sooner.\" on his personal Twitter page.\n\nMechanical Bull (2012-2013):\nThe band's sixth LP, \"Mechanical Bull\", was released on September 24, 2013. The album's first single, entitled \"Supersoaker\", was released on July 17, 2013.\n\nWalls (2016):\nOn Oct 14, 2016, Kings of Leon released their 7th studio album, \"Walls\", on the RCA Records label. It became the band's first number 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. The first single released from the album was \"Waste a Moment\".\n\nControversy\nKings of Leon caused controversy at the 2009 Reading Festival when Caleb Followill tried to get the crowd going by asking \"I thought this was supposed to be the loudest crowd in the world?\" Picking up on a perceived hostility towards the band, he announced \"we know you're sick of Kings of Leon, so for all those who don't give a fuck about us, I understand. But we've worked fucking hard to get here. So anyone that has anything to say to us, fuck you. We're the goddamn Kings of Leon.\" The band later smashed their guitars in anger and made rude gestures before leaving the stage. Nathan Followill further criticized the Reading crowd on his twitter page, declaring \"Zero love for the kings. I know it was cold but holy shit, y'all were frozen. I can only hope Leeds is in better form.\". At the Leeds Festival Caleb again bad-mouthed Reading while complimenting the Leeds crowd declaring \"We're only five songs in and you've blown Reading to hell\", while complimenting UK crowds in general stating \"It was the UK that made us feel like we could take on the world.\"\n\nDiscography\n\n    * Youth and Young Manhood (2003)\n    * Aha Shake Heartbreak (2004)\n    * Because of the Times (2007)\n    * Only by the Night (2008)\n    * Come Around Sundown (2010)\n    * Mechanical Bull (2013)\n    * Walls (2016) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kings+of+Leon\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

She spent a good few years as a Headcoatee before making her debut solo record, The Good Things, in 1995. \n\nWhere the Headcoatees sound was a blend of girl-group sounds and three-chord garage-rock, with all the original songs coming from the pen of Billy Childish, Holly\u2019s solo sound is more a blend of pre-rock electric blues, folk, soul and less frantic elements of rock & roll.  Apart from the wide range of covers of such artists as Willie Dixon, Ike Turner, Lee Hazelwood, Wreckless Eric, and Bill Withers, Golightly also writes her own material.\n\nSince her debut LP in 1995, Golightly has been very prolific, releasing fifteen albums and a bounty of singles for a wide variety of labels. Holly\u2019s sound has remained remarkably consistent throughout, but each record has a quality that sets it apart from the other releases.\n\nIn 1999 Surefire released an LP, In Blood, on which Billy Childish and Holly Golightly sing duets and the two of them celebrate One Chord, One Sound, One Song.\n\n2001\u2019s Desperate Little Town, released on Sympathy for The Record Industry, another collaboration (this time with Dan Melchior) marked a bit of a stylistic diversion as it is a relaxed and mostly acoustic record.  In the same year she also collected up all thirteen of her singles and E.P\u2019s onto one double album called Single\u2019s Round-Up.\n\nAfter playing several shows with The White Stripes, in the USA, and then supporting them at their some of their London shows, Holly has been good friends with Jack and Meg for some time, recording a duet with them \u2019It\u2019s True That We Love One Another\u2019, for their album Elephant.\n\nHolly has also recorded in the US with The Greenhornes and they released a special Christmas 2002 single together on Damaged Goods called Little Stars.  Holly appeared on the Greenhornes album Dual Mono which is out in the States on Telstar.  And Holly sings lead vocal on the track \u2019There\u2019s An End\u2019, which featured as the title track for the film, Broken Flowers.\n\nOver the years Holly has been guest vocalist on various other bands projects, including live with Mudhoney and on several Rocket From The Crypt releases. Her most recent album 2005\u2019s \u2019Slowly But Surely\u2019 released on Damaged Goods and recorded, as usual, by Liam Watson at ToeRag Studios in London.\n\nThere was also a 7\", \u2019Walk A Mile\u2019 taken from the album, with an exclusive b-side Don\u2019t Fuck Around With Love featuring the ever wonderful Sexton Ming.\n\nSites: MySpace.\n\nHolly Golightly is also the name of an indiepop band from Germany who released a four track 7\" single in 1992. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Holly+Golightly\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Where some songwriters trade in subtlety and dancing around blunt truths with clever feints and metaphor, Clark aims his words straight to the point and, when needed, right through the heart. His music is unrelentingly direct and hard-hitting, too, charged with a palpable rock \u2018n\u2019 roll immediacy that\u2019s as evident in his most intimate solo acoustic performances as it is in the full-tilt band shows that have packed rooms across his native Lone Star State from the Blue Light in Lubbock to the world\u2019s biggest honky- tonk, Billy Bob\u2019s Texas in Fort Worth. And with the April 21st release of \u2018Ringling Road,\u2019 his eagerly awaited fourth album, Green is set to make his biggest impact on the booming Texas/Red Dirt music scene \u2014 and beyond \u2014 yet.<p>But just don\u2019t call him the \u201cNext Big Thing,\u201d because as Green makes patently clear on \u2018Ringling Road\u201ds riotously myth-busting opening track, that\u2019s a laugh, buddy. And even with tongue firmly in cheek, William Clark Green is only interested in being real.<p>\u201cOh it\u2019s hard to pay your dues when there ain\u2019t no money in the bank It\u2019s a shame<br> I gotta make it to the show but there ain\u2019t no gas in the tank<br> It\u2019s insane<br> what you do for a broken heart and some busted strings And everybody saying I\u2019m the next big thing!\u201d<p>\u201cI\u2019m actually a little nervous about what people are going to think of that song, and if they\u2019ll think I\u2019m being an asshole,\u201d Clark admits with a laugh. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not the case at all, because it\u2019s actually sarcastic as hell. But we\u2019ve been hearing that \u2018you\u2019re the next big thing\u2019 thing for a long time now \u2014 and I\u2019m guilty of saying the same to some of my songwriter friends who are struggling out there, too. And even though it\u2019s always meant in a nice way, you can\u2019t help but think, \u2018What? I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019m actually sleeping in my truck tonight!\u201d<p>Not that he\u2019s complaining. Green is nothing if not fully committed to his chosen path. Granted, had a few chips fallen a little differently, he could have just as easily \u2014 and happily \u2014 devoted his life to ranching, but fate dictated pretty early on that he was meant to be a troubadour. He may have started taking guitar lessons at 13 primarily out of boredom \u2014 his family had just moved from Flint, Texas to College Station in the summer, and he didn\u2019t have any new school friends yet \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t long before he developed a keen interest in songwriting. A healthy obsession with his father\u2019s copy of Willis Alan Ramsay\u2019s classic 1972 debut had a lot to do with that (\u201cThat\u2019s still the best album I\u2019ve ever heard, and the reason I use three names,\u201d Green enthuses). So did timing: \u201cI remember seeing Robert Earl Keen and Pat Green and even Jerry Jeff Walker at the Wolf Pen Creek Amphitheater in College Station when I was in high school,\u201d he says. \u201cThe scene was really kind of in its birth then, and I was right there in the middle, paying attention and really intrigued by all of it.\u201d<p>College originally wasn\u2019t part of his game plan \u2014 \u201cI was a very poor student, and I still wanted to be a cowboy\u201d \u2014 but after a lead on a ranch-hand job fell through and a miserable two-week stint at a feed lot scared him straight, Green enrolled in junior college and eventually found his way to Texas Tech. He majored in agriculture economics, but spent more time songwriting and playing guitar at every open-mic night and hotel bar gig he could find than actually studying. By the time fellow Red Raider and Texas country rising star Josh Abbott handed him the keys to his Tuesday-night residency at the Blue Light, Green and his own band were on their way.<p>\u201cThat\u2019s when things got really serious for me,\u201d Green recalls. \u201cI came out with my first record [2008\u2019s \u2018Dangerous Man\u2019], and it kind of got to the point where I knew if I was going to pursue music, I\u2019d have to give it everything I had, because there\u2019s just no room for half-assing it in this business. School went to the wayside \u2014 I ended up graduating, but it took six years because music was my priority. And here I am now at 28 \u2014 about to release our fourth album and hoping to get to five before I\u2019m 30. That\u2019ll be a pretty quick turn around, but that\u2019s the goal.\u201d<p>The aforementioned \u201cnext big thing\u201d rumors started up in the wake of his second album, 2010\u2019s \u2018Misunderstood,\u2019 but it was 2013\u2019s \u2018Rose Queen\u2019 that proved his real breakthrough. Green recorded the album, produced by Rachel Loy in Nashville, at a real crossroads in his career \u2014 with momentum and high expectations at his back but barely enough money in the bank to foot the bill (and that only after a desperate call for help to angel investor Wade Bowen saved the day). \u201cIt was a huge leap of faith,\u201d Green says today, \u201cbut I told the band, \u2018We\u2019re going to pull out all the stops, and we\u2019re going to find a way to make exactly the record we want to make and need to make.\u201d The end result was a triumph, yielding Green\u2019s first three top-10 Texas Radio hits, including two chart-toppers in \u201cShe Likes the Beatles\u201d and \u201cHanging Around\u201d (the former also won \u201cSong of the Year\u201d honors at the fan-voted Lone Star Music Awards).<p>Of course, all of that set the bar even higher for the follow-up \u2014 and \u2018Ringling Road\u2019 delivers in spades. Returning to Nashville to team once again with Loy (Green calls working with the gifted up-and-coming producer \u201cthe best decision I\u2019ve ever made in my musical career\u201d), the band overcame a a couple of early setbacks \u2014 longtime drummer Jay Saldana had recently left for a new gig with Wade Bowen, followed by guitarist Steve Marcus breaking his arm a week before they went into the studio \u2014 to come through like champs under pressure. Saldana ended up coming back as a guest to drum on most of the record (along with new band member Ryan Garza), while the lead guitars duties were initially shared between Nashville session vet Kenny Greenberg and band friend Josh Serrato, recruited out of fellow Texas band Six Market Boulevard for what originally supposed to be \u201cfill-in\u201d duty. By the time Marcus\u2019 arm healed up enough for him to join the sessions halfway through, though, Serrato had been promoted from temp to full-time band member. Greenberg ended up staying on for the rest of the record as well.<p>\u201cAll three of those guys are monster talents on guitar, so It was a really incredible experience to have them all working with each other in the studio,\u201d Green marvels. \u201cIt all just happened the way it was supposed to, and we weren\u2019t going to get in the way of that!\u201d<p>With that formidable triple-guitar threat augmented by Green on acoustic, seasoned band member Cameron Moreland on bass and key assists from Loy and others on background vocals and a few other instrumental tracks, it\u2019s no wonder that \u2018Ringling Road\u2019 boasts the fullest sound of any WCG album to date. But as has been the case since day one of Green\u2019s career, it\u2019s the quality of his songs that ultimately makes the boldest statement. And it\u2019s not just the flat- out rockers (\u201cNext Big Thing\u201d) and irresistibly catchy, up-tempo numbers (\u201cSticks and Stones,\u201d \u201cCreek Don\u2019t Rise,\u201d \u201cGoing Home\u201d) that hit hard, either. Other highlights include \u201cOld Fashioned,\u201d a stirring elegy for a bygone Texas (\u201cThe interstate\u2019s pumping just like a vein full of California license plates\u201d), and the uproarious, Todd Snider-worthy title track, which takes its name from a real road in Green\u2019s current hometown of Eastland, Texas. Back in the day, the Ringling Bros. Circus used Eastland as a regular resting stop between shows, where the elephants and other animals were let off the train for a drink and the myriad circus folk would unwind and do whatever circus folk usually do on their nights off. As colorfully imagined by Green and co-writers Ross Cooper and Randal Clay, that was a helluva lot more wild and entertaining than the actual ticketed performances.<p>\u201cRoss is a good friend of mine from Lubbock, and Randal is a guy he met in Nashville who was actually a roustabout for 10 years,\u201d Green explains. \u201cI mean, what better way to write a song about the circus than to write it with a guy like that? Randal brought in a lot of truths about what really does happen behind the scenes in the circus. To be honest, after I told them about Eastland and the history of Ringling Road, he and Ross just got going on this tangent that was so good, I kind of just sat back and was like, \u2018keep going!&#39;\u201d<p>\u201cRingling Road,\u201d the song, may be a freak-show blast, but the rest of the album is hardly all fun and circus games. \u201cFinal This Time\u201d is a devastatingly frank post-mortem of a divorce Green witnessed between two close friends. \u201cFool Me Once\u201d and \u201cHey Sarah,\u201d two of the three songs (along with \u201cSticks and Stones\u201d) that Green wrote solo, are unflinching accounts of his own firsthand experiences at bad (or at least uncertain) love. And the lead single \u201cSympathy\u201d (already a No. 1 on Texas radio) offers anything but sympathy to a former lover looking for a shoulder to cry on.<p>Most brutal of all, though, is the hauntingly plaintive \u201cStill Think About You,\u201d in which the kind of sympathy Green does offer an ex comes laced with painfully bitter honesty: \u201cSorry that you fell in love with someone you could never inspire \u2026\u201d<p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m an asshole,\u201d Green says again, laughing. \u201cBut I feel like everybody has those selfish feelings sometimes, but they\u2019re never said in songs. I actually showed that song \u2014 I had the chorus written but still needed the verses \u2014 to Randy Rogers and Sean McConnell, and they both went, \u2018oh, that\u2019s not my style.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Well, maybe this is a terrible idea \u2026&#39;\u201d<p>Before giving up on it, though, Green showed it to one other trusted friend: Kent Finlay, songwriter\u2019s songwriter, founder of the legendary Cheatham Street Warehouse in San Marcos, Texas, and, not for nothing, Green\u2019s co-writer on \u2018Rose Queen\u201ds hit single \u201cHanging Around.\u201d Sage soul that he was, Finlay \u2014 who sadly passed away on March 2, 2015 after a long illness \u2014 took a shine to the unfinished song at first pitch.<p>\u201cI took it to Kent and said, \u2018I\u2019ve got this song, and no one seems to like it,&#39;\u201d Green recalls. \u201cBut I played what I had for him, and he went, \u2018Oh, I like that!\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Thank God, finally somebody does!\u2019 So we ended up finishing it together, and I\u2019m really glad we did.<p>\u201cTaking uncomfortable feelings like that and putting them to paper and writing songs about them \u2014 that\u2019s kind of been my staple, really,\u201d Green continues. \u201cAnd that song is about as true as it gets.\u201d<p>He pauses on that thought for a moment. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing,\u201d he adds with a laugh, \u201cbut I guess the truth prevails! And that makes me able to sleep at night.\u201d</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>", "img": null, "title": "William Clark Green", "url": "http://littlerock.eventful.com/events/william-clark-green-/E0-001-098598962-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Stickyz Rock N Roll Chicken Shack", "city": "Little Rock"}, {"date": "2018-03-17 19:00:00", "description": " \n", "img": null, "title": "14th Annual Blues Festival  featuring Sir Charles Jones, Willie Clayton, Pokey Bear, Latimore, Bobby Rush, Lenny Williams, Tyree Neal", "url": "http://dallas.eventful.com/events/14th-annual-blues-festival-featuring-sir-charl-/E0-001-109115203-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Verizon Theatre at Grand Prairie", "city": "Grand Prairie"}, {"date": "2018-03-08 21:30:00", "description": " with Rich O&#39;Toole<br> &quot;I grew up on 80&#39;s hair metal,&quot; Alex Williams says with a laugh. &quot;My dad listened to Cinderella and Ratt, so that was my musical upbringing until I was about 16.

I didn&#39;t want to be like that.&quot;&#39;Better Than Myself&#39; is a distant cry from the sugary pop hybrids currently dominating country radio airwaves, and as far as Williams is concerned, that&#39;s a good thing. He&#39;s part of a new breed of upstart outsiders, writing music that at once sounds both modern and traditional, channeling the raw, authentic sound that&#39;s made stars out of outlaw singers and red dirt rockers. His live show is a force to be reckoned with, earning him dates with everyone from Lynyrd Skynyrd to Hank Williams, Jr., but he&#39;s equally at home in the studio. Fat, twangy guitar tones, honky-tonk pianos, and swirling pedal steel lay the framework for Williams&#39; blend of vintage country and southern rock, and his lived-in baritone breathes genuine life and depth into his based-on-a-true-story brand of songwriting.&quot;This record represents the last ten years of my life,&quot; says Williams. &quot;My thoughts, my feelings, everything that I&#39;ve been through, it&#39;s all in these songs. It&#39;s what I&#39;ve wanted to say for a decade.&quot;Williams was born just outside Indianapolis, in the small town of Pendleton, IN. After graduating from high school, he relocated to Nashville for a short-lived stint at Belmont University, but he quickly dropped out after realizing he could learn more about life by hitting the road and experiencing it than he ever could in a classroom.&quot;I played some in Nashville and did the Broadway thing, and I played locally around Indiana some, too, but my first real gigs were in Texas,&quot; remembers Williams. &quot;I went down there because my cousin owned this shrimper bar on the Gulf coast where I could play. That was a big part of what got me so into Texas and all those Texas songwriters like Guy Clark, Jerry Jeff Walker, and Billy Joe Shaver.&quot;Williams had a band with some of his former college classmates, and by the time he was ready to make the leap and go solo, buzz about the group had caught the ear of Big Machine Label Group&#39;s Julian Raymond. While Big Machine might be best known as home to crossover stars like Taylor Swift, Raymond&#39;s illustrious pedigree as a GRAMMY-winning songwriter and producer included work with old school greats like Glen Campbell and Hank Williams Jr., and he sensed something special in Williams.&quot;I was worried,&quot; remembers Williams. &quot;I was 25, leaving this band, and I had no idea where my career was going to go, but Julian gave me a chance. He invited me to come by and start recording demos of my songs, and we probably ended up doing 50 or 60 of them. We kept slimming it down, but I kept writing.&quot;When it was time to head into the studio for proper recording sessions, Williams and Raymond pieced together an all-star band featuring some of Nashville&#39;s finest musicians: drummer Victor Indrizzo (Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris), keyboard player Matt Rollings (Lyle Lovett, Mark Knopfler), bassist Joeie Canaday (Leann Rimes, Steven Curtis Chapman), pedal steel player Dan Dugmore (James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt), and guitarists Tom Bukovac (Don Henley, Stevie Nicks) and J.T. Corenflos (Dolly Parton, Alan Jackson).With Raymond at the helm as producer, the band recorded live on the studio floor and wrapped basic tracking in just two days. The result is a rollicking throwback chock full of wit and wisdom, colored throughout by Williams&#39; fierce streak of independence. Album opener &quot;Better Than Myself,&quot; which features harmonica legend and longtime Willie Nelson bandmember Mickey Raphael, sets the stage perfectly, as Williams sings, &quot;Truth be told in every note I play / Truth be told I don&#39;t care what you say.&quot;&quot;One of my old bandmates was pissed at me one time and he said, &#39;Man, your songs are better than you are,&#39;&quot; Williams remembers. &quot;That was hard to hear, but I had to save the line. I wrote the song in the back room of a venue before we played one of our last shows together, and it really felt like this new beginning for me.&quot;Williams has never been one to pull a punch in his deeply personal songwriting. On the fingerpicked &quot;Pay No Mind,&quot; he imparts hard-won insight about what (and who) really matters, while the folky &quot;Freak Flag&quot; is a devil-may-care ode to being yourself, and &quot;Little Too Stoned&quot; laments the loss of the authentic in favor of our society&#39;s obsession with the latest trends and fads. Elsewhere on the album, the hard-charging &quot;Hell Bent Hallelujah&quot; offers up a profane prayer for some good news, the infectious &quot;More Than Survival&quot; insists on living a life that&#39;s more meaningful than just getting by, and &quot;A Few Short Miles&quot; draws inspiration from a figure Williams met during those early days onstage in Texas.&quot;There was a fisherman down there who rescued an old acoustic guitar from a dumpster after a hurricane came through Galveston,&quot; remembers Williams. &quot;One day I was in the bar restringing my guitar and he knocked on the door and gave it to me. It was really inspiring getting to know him, and a lot of things he said to me made it into that song.&quot;Perhaps the most personal track on the record, though, is &quot;Old Tattoo,&quot; a stirring ode to Williams&#39; grandfather and the strength of his mother and grandmother in the face of his passing. &quot;Time don&#39;t heal / It&#39;s just fadin&#39; like the floors of an old saloon,&quot; he sings. &quot;You can hide the pain away / Even if it&#39;s carved right into you / Like an old tattoo.&quot;It&#39;s an arresting moment, and an apt metaphor for a songwriter with the ability to lodge his melodies and lyrics deep beneath your skin. Forget fame and fortune, hits and hype. As far as Williams is concerned, the legacy you leave behind with the ones you care about most is the true measure of any man. With that in mind, and with a debut album as good as &#39;Better Than Myself&#39; under his belt, it&#39;s clear that Alex Williams is here to do more than just survive.", "img": null, "title": "Alex Williams", "url": "http://indianapolis.eventful.com/events/alex-williams-/E0-001-108779029-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "The Hi Fi", "city": "Indianapolis"}, {"date": "2018-03-20 19:30:00", "description": " Award-winning composer Alison Willis was commissioned by choir member Adrienne Morgan to write a choral piece celebrating life, love, togetherness and hope.

Tony Touch A.K.A Tony Toca continues to be a force to be reckoned with. Tony Touch, an icon in Hip Hop and in the Urban Hispanic genre plus seasoned player in the game, is a true innovator and has revolutionized the DJ game over and over. From his legendary mix tapes, to his skills on the 1\u2019s and 2\u2019s, he has become one of Hip Hop\u2019s most recognized DJ\u2019s. This C.E.O/Artist/Producer is now currently working on his 7th commercial release titled \u201cThe Piece Maker 3\u2026Return of the 50 MC\u2019s\u201d and is expected to make history once again. Tony Touch began as a B-Boy during the rap music renaissance era of the early 80\u2019s. Heavily influenced by pioneers like the Rock Steady Crew, Grandmaster Flash, Red Alert, \u201dLittle\u201d Louie Vega, and Jam Master Jay, he quickly shifted his interests towards the turntables. Toca is known for his legendary mix tapes like the original 50 MC\u2019s parts 1, 2 and 3. Included in this series are some of the hottest artists in the game such as KRS ONE, Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane, Wyclef, M.O.P., Big L, Mos Def and many more all coming together for one collective piece. This along with the countless other mix tapes, Tony became recognized in the streets and industry as the real \u2018Mix Tape King.\u2019 Tony Toca evolved his mix tapes to record releases. In 2000, Tony released \u201cThe Piece Maker\u201d on Tommy Boy records. This album sold over 400,000 units worldwide and featured legendary artists like Big Pun, Cypress Hill, Wu Tang Clan, Busta Rhymes, Eminem, Gang Starr, and much more. The video for the single \u201cI Wonder Why\u201d featuring Total featured cameos from John Leguizamo, Rock Steady and more. Since then, Tony Touch has released the \u201cPiece Maker 2\u201d which also had an all-star line up with features such as P. Diddy, Fat Joe, Sean Paul, Snoop Dog and even the legendary Ruben Blades. Toca is also known to represent the Latino community to the fullest. It is the result of growing up with Salsa at home and Hip-Hop influence in his lifestyle. In 2005 Tony inked a deal with EMI Records and revolutionized the game once more with his Latin album called \u201cReggaeTony\u201d. The hit single, \u201cPlay that Song\u201d featured Nina Sky and B-Real of Cypress Hill. The cd had an all star line up including Tego Calderon, Ivy Queen, Zion y Lennox, N.O.R.E, Voltio, and Soni just to name a few. The album went GOLD and with that success, EMI records moved quickly to release ReggaeTony 2 which featured more heavyweight appearances. Touch continues to be in demand globally. The proof is in the passport as he has toured over 30 countries including Japan, Australia, Puerto Rico, London, France, Greece, Russia, Brazil, Germany, Columbia, Switzerland, Italy and Cuba. He\u2019s also acted as tour DJ for acts like Cypress Hill, Gurus\u2019 Jazzmatazz, Rock Steady and the Beatnuts. You also may have caught Tony on TV shows such as \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cThe Dave Chapelle Show\u201d spinning for Eminem. And you may have heard him on the airwaves in New York City on such stations as Hot 97, Power 105, and 107.5 WBLS. In 2004, Eminem and manager Paul Rosenberg closed a deal for their own radio station on Sirius XM Satellite called Shade 45. Tony Touch was quickly recruited to host TOCA TUESDAYS from 8pm to Midnight. TOCA TUESDAYS is also a weekly classic Hip Hop party in which he invites legendary DJ\u2019s to guest spin. And if that weren\u2019t enough, another weekly party Tony sparked was the FUNKBOX where he plays deep house music with celeb guest DJ\u2019s. Both parties have been running over 4 years strong. <br>21+ Ages", "img": null, "title": "Tony Touch presented by E&J Certified", "url": "http://albuquerque.eventful.com/events/tony-touch-presented-ej-certified-/E0-001-109767240-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Sister Albuquerque", "city": "Albuquerque"}], "description": "There are currently two groups:\n\n1. A American Hip Hop group.\n\n2. A Japanese instrumental latin jazz-fusion group.\n\n\n1. The Beatnuts are a hip hop group and production duo from Queens, New York City. Its current members are JuJu and Psycho Les. JuJu (born Jerry Tineo on December 4, 1968) is Dominican American from Corona and Psycho Les (born Lester Fernandez on April 10, 1972) is a Colombian American from Jackson Heights. The Beatnuts were originally a trio before Kool Fashion, now known as Al' Tariq, left the group to start a solo career. The Mighty V.I.C. (Groove Merchantz, Ghetto Pros) was also a member of The Beatnuts' production team for a while.\n\nEarly on in their career they produced whole albums for Posse members Common Sense and Chi-Ali. Their production is noted as some of the finest and most accomplished, if unheralded, in all of hip-hop, often intricately detailed (as in their finely honed work for Mos Def on two tracks from Black on Both Sides) but more regularly barnstorming, club-friendly, flourish-laden party music. Jennifer Lopez used their track \"Watch Out Now\" as the instrumental for her song \"Jenny from the Block\". The Beatnuts produced more songs for the artists they had previously collaborated with as well as Fat Joe, Supr\u00eame NTM and Da Youngsta's. At the same time, The Beatnuts made their name as remix specialists by remixing songs for MC Lyte, Da Lench Mob, Naughty by Nature, Jomanda and others.\n\nThe Beatnuts are noted for being unabashedly, bullishly ribald and in-your-face performers. Recent Beatnuts albums are characterised by more Latin influences.\n\nLess known is they are considered part of the Native Tongues collective. The Beatnuts are the only Latino members of the Native Tongues collective. Although only peripheral members, they are routinely acknowledged by Q-Tip. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatnuts\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The 2-CD mix set is a sweeping change from anything you would have previously expected to hear from the Deep Dish member and it features the finest in house, electro, techno, and even industrial music.\n\nGrowing up in the Washington, DC area, Dubfire spent much of his youth playing the guitar in school bands and listening to heavy doses of classic Hip-Hop, jazz/rare groove, dub reggae, new wave and industrial. Dubfire was also influenced by the local punk scene and the music of hometown bands like Fugazi and Minor Threat. Members of these bands also worked at a local record store called Yesterday And Today Records, and this is where Dubfire first picked up on the sounds of acts such as Kraftwerk, Ministry, Jesus & Mary Chain, Depeche Mode, Nitzer Ebb, Adrian Sherwood/On-U Sound and Einsturzende Neubauten. Through this heavy industrial influence, namely the sound of Chicago\u2019s famed Wax Trax! label, Dubfire discovered the Chicago house scene and what labels like Trax and D.J. International Records were releasing.\n\nDubfire\u2019s eclectic new mix is the product of his diverse past and addictive music personality, and this mix is more about Dubfire personally and as a DJ. Dubfire\u2019s mix was compiled with tracks that he\u2019s both really into at the moment and that have also had a profound influence on shaping his love for music. Dubfire GU31 \u2013 Taipei is laced full of gems from a diverse lot including Depeche Mode, Carl Craig, Booka Shade, Extrawelt, Samuel L Session and Nitzer Ebb. However, the biggest surprise of all comes with Dubfire\u2019s original production \u201cI Feel Speed;\u201d a cover of an obscure Love & Rockets song that, for the first time, features his own vocals!  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dubfire\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

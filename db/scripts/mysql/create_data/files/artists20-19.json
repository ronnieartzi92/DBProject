don't see it happening, might drop a tape and never rap again\nGot a couple fans, hope they female\nWent from selling clothes to weed sales\nIf I had yo bitch, nigga don't ask me no details\n\nYeah

BRANDEN & JAMES, the Cello and Vocal duo, brings the soulful timbre of James on his cello combined with Branden&#39;s emotional and powerful vocals, creating a sound that leaves audiences feeling moved and inspired. the always supportive, sometimes haunting power of the cello accompanying Branden&#39;s voice solidifies the classical sound, adds new depth to the popular, and allows the audience to just sit back and take it inso movingly, that you may forget to breathe! says Paul Lisnek - Host of Broadway in Chicago Backstage. The energy and fervor behind their music has a story to tell of their unique pairing. Branden had a successful career on stage and in recording prior to his meeting the Australian cellist, James. Some of Branden&#39;s accolades include finishing as 2013 Finalist on Americas Got Talent, appearances at The Metropolitan Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago and Los Angeles Opera, two world tours with the renowned Twelve Tenors and two solo releases worldwide. James brought to the mix his own share of musical accomplishments, studying as a pianist at a young age and a career in music education before discovering performance as his ultimate love. James initially came on board to music direct one of many charity concerts that Branden was performing in at the time and their connection was so immense they began to play together. Since then, they&#39;ve been touring around the world playing their original songs and innovative, classically inspired covers.

Tats\u00e4chlich hat er nicht gerade die angenehmsten Geschichten aus seiner Kindheit und Jugend zu berichten: Crack raubte August Alsina schon fr\u00fch die Vaterfigur, er siedelte mit seiner Mutter von New Orleans nach Houston um und fand, inspiriert von Gr\u00f6\u00dfen wie Lauren Hill, schlie\u00dflich zur Musik. 2011 zog der mittlerweile 25-j\u00e4hrige R&B S\u00e4nger nach Atlanta, landete einen Management-Deal und legte 2012 mit &quot;The Product\u201c sein erstes Mixtape vor. Als dann &quot;I Luv This Shit\u201c feat. Trinidad James herauskam, waren die Weichen f\u00fcr seinen Solo-Durchbruch gestellt. Sein Deb\u00fctalbum &quot;Testimony\u201c, welches 2014 ver\u00f6ffentlicht wurde, schaffte es auf Platz zwei der US Billboard Charts. Es folgten Features mit Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj und Chris Brown, sowie eine gemeinsame Tour mit Usher. Gerade seine bedingungs- und schonungslose Ehrlichkeit begeisterte nicht nur die Kritiker, sondern verhalf ihm auch zu massiven Chart-Erfolgen. Im selben Jahr war August Alsina in mehreren Kategorien bei den BET Awards nominiert. Den Award als &quot;Best New Artist\u201c nahm er am Schluss dann auch mit nach Hause. 2015 folgte dann sein zweites Album &quot;This Thing Called Life\u201c, welches auch in die Top 20 der Billboard Charts einstieg.

While Ferg and Rocky were originally planned to be the crew&#39;s Mobb Deep-like duo, they found more success as solo artists, beginning with Rocky and his series of 2012 mixtapes. Ferg&#39;s big break came that same year when his track &quot;Work&quot; landed as the key cut on A$AP Mob&#39;s Lords Never Worry mixtape. The announcement that A$AP Ferg signed with RCA came in early 2013 and was followed by an all-star remix of &quot;Work,&quot; with Trinidad James, French Montana, and ScHoolboy Q added to the cut. Ferg&#39;s &quot;Persian Wine&quot; single landed that same year, along with his solo album Trap Lord. His Ferg Forever mixtape dropped in 2014 and spawned the 2015 hit &quot;Dope Walk.&quot; A year later his &quot;New Level&quot; single arrived featuring Future, along with his sophomore album, Always Strive and Prosper, which included guest shots from Missy Elliott, Chuck D, Skrillex, and Lil Uzi Vert. In 2017, Ferg teamed up with Remy Ma for the hard-hitting single &quot;East Coast.&quot; This was followed by the release of his second mixtape, Still Striving, later that summer.

Yet about half of the adolescents in New Hampshire are not fully vaccinated. This session will improve your understanding of the HPV vaccine, why it\u2019s critical to increase vaccination rates in New Hampshire, and highlight the work of the New Hampshire HPV Vaccine Working Group and other efforts in our state. D. Advancing Equity for All when Integrating Clinical and Public Health Efforts for Cancer Control and Prevention Trinidad Tellez, MD, Director, Office of Health Equity, NH DHHS We all aim to provide the highest quality care and services to all our clients/patients \u2013 yet, how do we know we are doing so equally effectively? Disparities in access, use and outcomes persist across health care services, public health, and social determinant of health domains \u2013 what are essential elements for us to be able to identify those disparities and then work to address them? This session will describe cancer health disparities, review proven strategies for promoting cancer equity, and provide a framework for improving our own organization\u2019s capacity to provide high quality care and services for all. E. Partnering for Success: Supporting our patients in adopting healthier habits after a cancer diagnosis and into survivorship Gwenda Graham, MSN, PhD, ANP-BC, Nurse Practitioner, Department of Hematology/Oncology, The Center for Cancer CareMeredith Kolodze, LICSW, OSW-C, Oncology Social Worker, The Center for Cancer Care, Exeter Hospital There is a unique opportunity to help support healthier habits and secondary prevention after a patient has completed treatment for cancer. It is important that we meet people where they are at and help empower them to improve their health, rather than demand that they improve it. We will be providing tools and techniques to help all members of the oncology team support patients in developing healthier habits after a cancer diagnosis.

Sessions and Tracks Innate immunity Innate immune responses are not specific to a particular pathogen or non-self-ingredient in the way that the adaptive immune responses are. They depend on a group of proteins and phagocytic cells that recognize conserved features of pathogens and become quickly activated to help destroy invaders. The innate immune system is essentially made up of barriers that aim to keep viruses, bacteria, parasites, and other foreign particles out of your body or limit their ability to spread and move throughout the body. Defense Mechanisms General Immune Responses \u00a0Phagocytes & Macrophages The Complement System Host-Pathogen Interactions Pathogen sensing and restriction Pathological inflammation in response to microbes \u00a0 Regulation of T/B cell responses For immunomodulation and\u00a0\u00a0 suppression of immune responses it needs regulation of immune cells. As Aberrant T/B cell responses developed wide range of diseases, including asthma and allergy and autoimmune diseases and many immunological disorders as T/B cells are the main route of the immune response ans its very important to regulate there function by different mechanism . Immune Regulator Interferon\u2019s Signalling Pathways Suppression & Stabilization of T/B Cells SIGNALING CASCADES (CYTOKINE SIGNALS) Adaptive immunity The adaptive immune system, also known as the acquired immune response which is more specific immune response then the innate immune response.\u00a0 Adaptive immune response is composed of highly specialized, systemic cells and processes that eliminate or prevent pathogen growth. It having ability to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently which creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen and lead to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. Immunological memory Vaccine development Immune Responses: Primary and Secondary Germinal centres Affinity maturation & Selection Antibody - mediated immunity Infectious Diseases and Immune System Infectious diseases are disorders caused by organisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites and immune system recognise them as non-self-antigen and produce immune response against them to protect our host cell from harmful infections. PathogenesisTropical infectionsViral infectionsSurgical Site InfectionsFungal infectionsInfections Prevention and Control Immunological basis for Immunization disease The Immunological Basis for immunization was initially developed in 1993 as a set of eight modules focusing on the vaccines included in the Expanded Programme on immunization (EPI). It\u2019s the development of the Global Immunization Vision and Strategy of Immunization disease. Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals Immunological Responses to Immunization Immunization Series Current Research on Immunization Global Immunization Vision and Strategy Clinical immunology Clinical immunology is the study of diseases caused by disorders of the immune system. It also involves diseases of other systems, where immune reactions play a part in the pathology and\u00a0clinical\u00a0features of immune response. In the Clinical immunology the molecular and cellular bases of immunological disease mostly studied. ImmunodermatologyImmunotoxicologyClinical Laboratory ImmunologyImmunological DiseasePrimary ImmunodeficiencyNeuroimmunology Cellular Immunology Cellular Immunology is a broad area of in vitro and in vivo studies of cellular immune responses in the immune system. In the Cellular Immunology mostly study the mechanisms that regulate innate and adaptive functions of dendritic cells (DCs) during priming of T cells immunity on the cellular level. Diagnostic ImmunologyImmunomodulationImmunotherapeuticsCellular and Molecular Immunology ResearchMolecular & Cellular ImmunologyRegional ImmunologyRegional Immunology offers a new approach to communication in the field of immunology. The stated purpose of the journal is &quot;to provide a focus for the judicious dissemination of results of experimental studies of immune activities as they are induced, expressed, and regulated in different regions of the body. Mucosal ImmunologyImmune MechanismsOcular ImmunologyAutoimmune diseasePediatric immunology Transplantation ImmunologyTransplantation is the act of transferring cells, tissues, or organs from one site to another in the living body. Most of the kidney, liver, heart, lung, or pancreas main organs transplant from a donor to recipient. But the immune system is the most formidable barrier to transplantation as a treatment. The immune system is developed very specifically and effectively to recognise foreign agents and self-antigen of the body, and this mechanisms are also involved in the rejection of transplanted organs of the body and reject the transplantation. Organ transplantation failureHair TransplantationPediatric TransplantBone marrow TransplantTransplantation Technologies & ResearchTransplantation RejectionViral Immunology & Infection control Viral Immunology delivers cutting-edge peer-reviewed research on emerging, rare, and under-studied viruses, with special focus on analyzing mutual relationships between external viruses and internal immunity. Active immunization involves administering a virus preparation that stimulates the body&#39;s immune system to produce its own specific immunity against virus. Immunopathology and Immunodeficiencies The Immunopathology and Immunodeficiencies is innate and acquired immunity, passive and active immunization and immunopathologies, such as hypersensitivity reactions, autoimmunity and immunodeficiency and all disorders which cause by immune system.The Immunopathology is a branch of medicine that deals with immune responses associated with immunological disorders, and the Immunodeficiencies is immune system&#39;s ability to fight infectious disease get low or absent. Microbial, Parasitic, and Fungal Immunology Microbial, Parasitic, and Fungal Immunology is the study of the molecular and infection causing mechanisms used by microbes, Parasites & fungal but the Immune response show mechanism to destroy the infection as Immune system show specific immune response towards specific Infection.

He has signed a major record deal with Def Jam Recordings, and is the CEO of his own record label Gold Gang Records.\n\nHis debut single, \u201cAll Gold Everything\u201d has charted at 77 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It\u2019s from his debut mixtape, Don\u2019t Be S.A.F.E., released on October 16, 2012. Like many other artists in the Hip-Hop industry, Trinidad James found his way to the mainstream audience via The Source Magazine\u2019s Unsigned Hype column.\n\nThere\u2019s no hotter commodity in hip-hop right now than Trinidad James. After we named him one of the new Atlanta rappers to watch out for, the 25-year-old rapper has blown-up overnight, propelled by his viral smash \u201cAll Gold Everything,\u201d thanks in large to an irresistibly charming music video and a really catchy lyric about Molly.\n\n\u2026 he played his first headlining show in NYC and it was absolute pandemonium with fans, celebrities, and industry insiders stuck standing outside after the venue was packed to capacity. Inside, James proved that even if you\u2019re skeptical of the hype, he puts on one hell of a show, and the hundreds of camera phones on-hand caught video clips that serve as sufficient proof of that.\n\nIf you sit down with James, it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s intelligent, self-aware, and a natural born hustler. He hasn\u2019t been rapping professionally for long, but he clearly understands hip-hop, its culture, and most importantly, the genre\u2019s trends.\n\nThe day after his Big Apple performance, we had ATL\u2019s newly-minted star stop by the Complex office (he showed up on time, the rarest of feats for a rapper) for a conversation in which we attempted to find out, Who Is Trinidad James? James told us about being recruited by labels, his relationship with A$AP Rocky, hustling Pok\u00e9mon cards, his city\u2019s buzzing music scene, and much more. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Trinidad+James\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

RCA Studio B was fundamental to the creation of the Nashville Sound, and the ghosts of some of the greatest songs in history live within its walls: Dolly Partons I Will Always Love You, and Elvis Presleys Are You Lonesome Tonight? among them.Artists who choose to record at Studio B are met with a rigorous list of requirements, including using a recording method appropriate during the studios heyday. Since the studio is a working museum by day, the entirety of McPhersons workspace had to be reset at night: Load in all equipment in the late afternoon, work until 3:00 or 4:00 a.m., and leave no trace nightly. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.Those rules would probably turn a lot of bands off, but they turned us on, 100 percent, McPherson says. I really love walking into a classic studio as much as I love getting my hands on a really old guitar. I like knowing that something was used for a long time and has good things in it.But this isnt an old Nashville record, by any measurement, nor is it the record McPherson set out to make, with credit due to co-producer Dan Molad (also the drummer for Lucius).Theres a pretty broad gap in our tastes, what we do and what were into, McPherson says.

He also delved into character profiles, both fictional and based on real-life experiences, stories McPherson has held onto but never thought of as fodder for songwriting, such as the Las Vegas bus station interlude detailed in Style (Is a Losing Game). That seems like a pretty normal thing for a singer-songwriter to do, to write about personal experience, but I really have never done that, McPherson says. It felt great but it also was tough at the same time. The thing is, John Henry is trying to beat the machine because hes in awe of it. It was a lot of me saying, Youre really good at this, and I have a hard time doing it. With a group of soul-baring tracks taking shape, McPherson and crew scheduled studio time to help force the issue. It quickly became apparent that these sessions were not going to work, bringing McPhersons momentum to a halt. To clear his head, he flew to Los Angeles at the invitation of friend and longtime supporter Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age, who was also recording at the time. McPherson, Homme, and his Queens bandmate Dean Fertita played around with some songs, with Homme pushing McPherson outside of his comfort zone in a no-stakes environment. His thing was, Im going to throw all kinds of crap onto your songs that youre not going to want to hear, and youre going to play ridiculous stuff you wouldnt normally do, and Dean was kind of the calming presence, McPherson says. McPherson calls the getaway the most fun Ive had since I was 15 years old and returned to Nashville with a clear head, internal filters successfully stifled, ready to move forward. That fresh perspective in tow, McPherson learned that the long-shot backup studio, the legendary RCA Studio B in Nashville, was willing to host his band for the making of the record. RCA Studio B was fundamental to the creation of the Nashville Sound, and the ghosts of some of the greatest songs in history live within its walls: Dolly Partons I Will Always Love You, and Elvis Presleys Are You Lonesome Tonight? among them. Artists who choose to record at Studio B are met with a rigorous list of requirements, including using a recording method appropriate during the studios heyday. Since the studio is a working museum by day, the entirety of McPhersons workspace had to be reset at night: Load in all equipment in the late afternoon, work until 3:00 or 4:00 a.m., and leave no trace nightly. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Those rules would probably turn a lot of bands off, but they turned us on, 100 percent, McPherson says. I really love walking into a classic studio as much as I love getting my hands on a really old guitar. I like knowing that something was used for a long time and has good things in it.But this isnt an old Nashville record, by any measurement, nor is it the record McPherson set out to make, with credit due to co-producer Dan Molad (also the drummer for Lucius). Theres a pretty broad gap in our tastes, what we do and what were into, McPherson says. Where hes as likely to lean on The Cramps as he is Irma Thomas for inspiration, Molads left-field production suggestions included a Casio synthesizer and running a Fender Rhodes through a tape delay. (McPherson nixed the former; the latter became the signature sound of one of the records tracks.) We ended up learning a lot from each other, and he did a lot of stuff Id have never thought to do.

Hannibals\nAnd gotta be acceptables, I never took the corners\nI was way more diagonal\nCorner power with the power that he held in the streets so intangible\nLook up to the kin\nKnow the color of the skin\nMore like a correlation with the nature that's within\nTold everybody I was related to him\nBig homie did this\nBlaze one up to this\nI was in a battlefield with the neutralist grounds\nHe was born on the wrong side of the gun sound\nIntentions, never knew, never seen him pull a trigger\nBut I knew when he came around he never show that figure\nBut the gang signs around him always gonna make him think of better ways of living life\nLet me show this little nigga\nChange directions, reach a popular view\nDon't be a knucklehead on Crooks Avenue\nDon't be like me, nigga, fight for your dreams\nI know you do music that will bring your needs\nLeft my comfort zone for two years now\nWorking on career now\nThen you heard news of the same child\nCause I'm around you, lost hope\nBut I made it possible, take your advice\nBro, I heard you paint well\nDope, don't do the block, nigga, keep doing you\nMy outlet growing bigger, I support too\nYou did me a favor and I made the move\nNow I'm a star\nLeast I could do is just pay all my dues\nNews just in, another fallen angel\nThe world is so cruel, my heart turn in two\n\nEvery time I feel alive I think about dead friends\nThe rest is

dead to me\nSleeping couch to couch just to find a way in\nLiving on my own now\nLiving on my own now\nLiving on my own now\n\nI was partially standing beside him when they parted the Red Sea\nSee the blood on the hydrant and the leaves like 'Ye said\nThey dead, funeral\nNewspaper like a brand new obituary\nRapping my contemporaries, I ain't gotta think about it\nI dreamt about it\nWhat's a demon to a ghetto now?\nMove around, heard a couple shots in my solitude, hallelu\nWent right past, that's what God'll do\nThey found nutritional value at the base of my conscious\nIt taste like peaches, no nonsense\nNo Noname, no tickets for purchase\nMy market was marketing Gypsy for prophet or profit\nCause everybody speaks truth\nBelieve in your words\nBelieve in yourself, the things we dream about\nAnd let them feed you\n\nLiving on my own now\nLiving on my own now\nLiving on my own now\nLiving on my own now", "youtube": {"duration": 183, "date_published": "2015-10-02 19:09:27",

Each song becomes like a spring-loaded can of worms: there\u2019s all this energy boxed up in a neat little package, and then when you come see us live, the cap comes off and the contents fly out in every direction like fireworks.\u201d<p>It\u2019s a whimsically apt metaphor for Pigeons Playing Ping Pong, a band whose very existence is rooted in the unyielding quest for joy and positive energy. Blending infectious funk grooves, psychedelic jams, and experimental electronics, the Baltimore four-piece\u2019s new album, \u2018Pizazz,\u2019 is a buoyant, blissful reminder of just how much fun music can be. Eschewing the traditional funk band lineup that typically includes keyboards, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong constructs effervescent soundscapes with just two guitars, bass, and drums, crafting their music with a sophisticated ear for both open space and dense layering.<p>While \u2018Pizazz\u2019 is, in many ways, a familiar continuation of the journey that\u2019s earned the band its rapidly expanding and rabidly devoted following (known as The Flock), it also marks the beginning of a new chapter for Pigeons Playing Ping Pong. The album\u2019s eleven tracks are the group\u2019s first recorded with new drummer Alex Petropulos, whose airtight grooves and explosive power push the band\u2019s sound to new heights.<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had some of these songs in our live catalog for a while,\u201d says Ormont, \u201cbut playing them with Alex has breathed new life into everything. His style and energy have revealed nooks and crannies that we didn\u2019t even realize existed in the tracks. All music boils down to having a good drummer, especially in our dance-oriented jam world, and we\u2019ve got the best drummer I\u2019ve ever heard right now.\u201d<p>It\u2019s a bold claim, but Pigeons Playing Ping Pong has the live show to back it up. Glide Magazine called them \u201ca band that melts faces and pulls no punches,\u201d while C-Ville Weekly praised the growing \u201ccult around [their] high-energy music, goofy stage antics, and all around good vibes,\u201d and JamBase raved that guitarist/vocalist Jeremy Schon is \u201cdestined to become one of our generation\u2019s finest guitarists.\u201d Since the group\u2019s inception nearly a decade ago at the University of Maryland (where the band\u2019s name came to Ormont and Schon during a moment of transcendence in Psych 100), they\u2019ve built up a reputation as one of the most engaging and life-affirming acts on the road, maintaining a relentless tour schedule that has them performing up to 200 shows a year and hitting festivals from coast to coast. The band even founded their own gathering, Domefest, which recently celebrated its eighth year and attracted nearly 2,000 members of The Flock for an immersive weekend of love, music, and community.<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really important that our live show puts out as much energy as possible and promotes lightheartedness and positivity,\u201d says Schon. \u201cAll that matters in the moment at a concert is what\u2019s going on onstage and in the room around you, and we try to put on a show where people can really lose themselves in those moments and use our music as an outlet to feel good.\u201d<p>The band chased those same ideals when they headed into producer Steve Wright\u2019s WrightWay Studios in Baltimore to record \u2018Pizazz,\u2019 the follow-up to their 2016 fan-favorite \u2018Pleasure.\u2019 Tracking live on the floor, the foursome channeled all the rapture of their live shows into tight, crisp packages. Songs that may unfold onstage over the course of 20 minutes were reimagined for the studio, where they\u2019d need to reach the same frenzied, emotional heights, in less than half that time.<p>\u201cI think this album really shows attention to detail when it comes to choosing our moments and the way we\u2019ve been able to make parts more concise without losing their natural feel,\u201d says Ormont. \u201cHaving a strong drummer is a big part of that. Alex is able to convey so much feeling and bring us to those peaks and valleys really quickly and efficiently when we need him to.\u201d<p>\u2018Pizazz\u2019 opens up with the bouncing, carefree \u201cFun In Funk,\u201d which finds the band proclaiming, \u201cWe put the fun in funk\u201d over wah-wah guitars and an infectious rhythm section driven both by Petropulos\u2019s drums and Ben Carrey\u2019s fat, slinky bass lines.<p>\u201cFunk is very fun, upbeat, happy music to begin with,\u201d says Ormont. \u201cIt\u2019s our mission to put that fun into everything we do.\u201d<p>It\u2019s a mission that Pigeons Playing Ping Pong was born for. The visceral sense of joy in their music acts as a sort of glue here, binding the band\u2019s wildly versatile sounds into a cohesive and distinctive whole on the album. On \u201cSomethin For Ya,\u201d they channel 70\u2019s disco and pair it with a wicked prog-rock solo, while tracks like \u201cOffshoot\u201d and \u201cToo Long\u201d embrace the group\u2019s darker, more bass-and-electronics-influenced dance side. \u201cPoseidon\u201d and frequent show-closer \u201cOcean Flows,\u201d on the other hand, showcase Pigeons\u2019 bright, sparkling, melodic soul, as \u2018Pizazz\u2019 rises and falls with the same inimitable mix of precision and frenzy that defines the band\u2019s one-of-a-kind live show.<p>Each Pigeon is a virtuosic musician and improviser in his own right, and the band\u2019s songs are frequently born out of impromptu grooves and riffs. The swirling, trippy \u201cPorcupine,\u201d which clocks in at nearly eight minutes in all its jamming glory, taps into the uninhibited, open-ended nature of the band\u2019s rehearsal sessions, while the driving \u201cHenrietta\u201d grew out of one of Schon\u2019s soundcheck guitar loops. The island vibes of \u201cFox and Toad\u201d are pure stream of consciousness written in the car after band practice, and \u201cDoc\u201d is a gritty, horn-fueled sing-along inspired by a Baltimore legend.<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a homeless man named Doc who would always spend his time outside of the 8\u00d710 in Federal Hill, where we learned to push our limits as a band,\u201d says Ormont. \u201cDoc always supported us. Even though he was sleeping under a bridge, he\u2019d always ask you how you were doing. We really wanted to commemorate his toughness and positivity.\u201d<p>It\u2019s difficult to think of a more fitting match for a band like Pigeons Playing Ping Pong, who radiate positivity wherever they go. Whether it\u2019s Doc or The Flock, the band wants to elevate each and every member of their audience to the kind of blissful place that only the most ecstatic live music can take you.

Here comes a walking fire\u2019 (King Lear) Metaphor is an intensely rich area of imaginative life. In the ability of metaphors to carry meaning from the known to the unknown, the conscious to the unconscious, they point toward the very heart of psychotherapeutic process. In this workshop we will explore the application of metaphors in clinical practice as well as the root metaphors embedded within psychological theory. The weekend will critique the limitations of technological metaphors hidden in much of therapeutic language. Ecological metaphors will be introduced that better convey the wildness and irregularity of human experience. In particular, we will draw upon the integration of psychotherapy with chaos theory and fractal geometry, contemporary perspectives which have emerged from the modelling of natural systems, such as cloud formations, lightning pathways and the beatings of the human heart.\u00a0 This seminar will support you to: Speak, think and see through metaphor, avoiding the dangers of concrete and literal language, thinking and perception. Work with \u2018living metaphor\u2019 from immediate experience in client fantasies, feelings, body sensations and gestures. Notice fractal patterns as metaphors of wholeness. Use the idea of a \u2018fractal psyche\u2019 to ground therapeutic insights in everyday life. Apply nonlinear perspectives from chaos theory to the therapeutic relationship, development and healing.\u00a0 Theoretical presentation will be grounded in clinical case study discussion, therapist-client role-play, experiential encounters with the local landscape and through attending to the group (i.e. yourself, others and the leader) as a nonlinear system. Further information: Mind-as-machine metaphors are woven into our everyday language. To speak of feeling \u2018shut down\u2019 or having \u2018blown a gasket\u2019; to consider our personality as an assemblage of component \u2018parts\u2019 -these colloquial usages are rooted in a common-sense assumption of a mechanical world, which has become internalised by the shaping of psychological theory firstly by mechanical and later computational metaphors. For example, Freud\u2019s psychodynamic theory, still very much in use today, rests upon the then cutting-edge hydrodynamic technology of the early 1900s, the steam engine. Technology has captured our imaginations and our very sense of self. But human beings are complex creatures embedded within a biosphere quite unlike the static, linear and controllable paradigm of mechanical technology. We are not machines and clinical practice is often anything but mechanical. Two key areas will be covered: 1. Living metaphors at the edge of chaos: \u00a0how by drawing on chaos theory we can view client symptoms as finely balanced, dynamic systems of complex forces; how in the zone between disorder and stability known as \u2018the edge of chaos\u2019 a tiny event can trigger significant \u2018phase change\u2019 (such as when boiling water turns into steam); we will explore the holistic sensitivity required to detect the spontaneous arising of these tiny events in the fantasies, feelings, bodily symptoms and gestures of \u2018living metaphor\u2019 \u2013 metaphors from immediate experience prior to conceptualisation and the dead-hand of generalised theory. 2. The fractal psyche as a metaphor of wholeness: how to cultivate our intuitive feel for fractal patterns, familiar already from nature (e.g. flickering flames, waves on an ocean, skin wrinkles and snail\u2019s shells); how to see each fractal image as a reflection of the whole, on ever finer scales ( like Russian Dolls); how any small piece of clinical material ( such as a dream, a passing comment, even how a client walks into the room) is a fractal image, reflective of the whole therapy and the client\u2019s history, current symptoms and emerging future; and how to work with fractals in clinical practice.\u00a0 \u00a0 The approach offers a perhaps surprising and counterintuitive non-linear understanding that shines new light on relationships, development and healing. However, it is expected participants will find familiarity within chaos theory as a way of thinking about recognisable, but often overlooked, aspects of clinical experience and also as a framework that resonates with psychological metaphors from pre-modern traditions such as alchemy and Buddhism.

When were recording in the studio, we try to maintain that euphoria while finding a way to pack it into a tight, focused vessel. Each song becomes like a spring-loaded can of worms: theres all this energy boxed up in a neat little package, and then when you come see us live, the cap comes off and the contents fly out in every direction like fireworks.Its a whimsically apt metaphor for Pigeons Playing Ping Pong, a band whose very existence is rooted in the unyielding quest for joy and positive energy. Blending infectious funk grooves, psychedelic jams, and experimental electronics, the Baltimore four-pieces new album, Pizazz, is a buoyant, blissful reminder of just how much fun music can be. Eschewing the traditional funk band lineup that typically includes keyboards, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong constructs effervescent soundscapes with just two guitars, bass, and drums, crafting their music with a sophisticated ear for both open space and dense layering.While Pizazz is, in many ways, a familiar continuation of the journey thats earned the band its rapidly expanding and rabidly devoted following (known as The Flock), it also marks the beginning of a new chapter for Pigeons Playing Ping Pong. The albums eleven tracks are the groups first recorded with new drummer Alex Petropulos, whose airtight grooves and explosive power push the bands sound to new heights.Weve had some of these songs in our live catalog for a while, says Ormont, but playing them with Alex has breathed new life into everything. His style and energy have revealed nooks and crannies that we didnt even realize existed in the tracks. All music boils down to having a good drummer, especially in our dance-oriented jam world, and weve got the best drummer Ive ever heard right now.Its a bold claim, but Pigeons Playing Ping Pong has the live show to back it up. Glide Magazine called them a band that melts faces and pulls no punches, while C-Ville Weekly praised the growing cult around [their] high-energy music, goofy stage antics, and all around good vibes, and JamBase raved that guitarist/vocalist Jeremy Schon is destined to become one of our generations finest guitarists. Since the groups inception nearly a decade ago at the University of Maryland (where the bands name came to Ormont and Schon during a moment of transcendence in Psych 100), theyve built up a reputation as one of the most engaging and life-affirming acts on the road, maintaining a relentless tour schedule that has them performing up to 200 shows a year and hitting festivals from coast to coast. The band even founded their own gathering, Domefest, which recently celebrated its eighth year and attracted nearly 2,000 members of The Flock for an immersive weekend of love, music, and community.Its really important that our live show puts out as much energy as possible and promotes lightheartedness and positivity, says Schon. All that matters in the moment at a concert is whats going on onstage and in the room around you, and we try to put on a show where people can really lose themselves in those moments and use our music as an outlet to feel good.The band chased those same ideals when they headed into producer Steve Wrights WrightWay Studios in Baltimore to record Pizazz, the follow-up to their 2016 fan-favorite Pleasure. Tracking live on the floor, the foursome channeled all the rapture of their live shows into tight, crisp packages. Songs that may unfold onstage over the course of 20 minutes were reimagined for the studio, where theyd need to reach the same frenzied, emotional heights, in less than half that time.I think this album really shows attention to detail when it comes to choosing our moments and the way weve been able to make parts more concise without losing their natural feel, says Ormont. Having a strong drummer is a big part of that. Alex is able to convey so much feeling and bring us to those peaks and valleys really quickly and efficiently when we need him to.Pizazz opens up with the bouncing, carefree Fun In Funk, which finds the band proclaiming, We put the fun in funk over wah-wah guitars and an infectious rhythm section driven both by Petropuloss drums and Ben Carreys fat, slinky bass lines.Funk is very fun, upbeat, happy music to begin with, says Ormont. Its our mission to put that fun into everything we do.Its a mission that Pigeons Playing Ping Pong was born for. The visceral sense of joy in their music acts as a sort of glue here, binding the bands wildly versatile sounds into a cohesive and distinctive whole on the album. On Somethin For Ya, they channel 70s disco and pair it with a wicked prog-rock solo, while tracks like Offshoot and Too Long embrace the groups darker, more bass-and-electronics-influenced dance side. Poseidon and frequent show-closer Ocean Flows, on the other hand, showcase Pigeons bright, sparkling, melodic soul, as Pizazz rises and falls with the same inimitable mix of precision and frenzy that defines the bands one-of-a-kind live show.Each Pigeon is a virtuosic musician and improviser in his own right, and the bands songs are frequently born out of impromptu grooves and riffs. The swirling, trippy Porcupine, which clocks in at nearly eight minutes in all its jamming glory, taps into the uninhibited, open-ended nature of the bands rehearsal sessions, while the driving Henrietta grew out of one of Schons soundcheck guitar loops. The island vibes of Fox and Toad are pure stream of consciousness written in the car after band practice, and Doc is a gritty, horn-fueled sing-along inspired by a Baltimore legend.Theres a homeless man named Doc who would always spend his time outside of the 810 in Federal Hill, where we learned to push our limits as a band, says Ormont. Doc always supported us. Even though he was sleeping under a bridge, hed always ask you how you were doing. We really wanted to commemorate his toughness and positivity.Its difficult to think of a more fitting match for a band like Pigeons Playing Ping Pong, who radiate positivity wherever they go. Whether its Doc or The Flock, the band wants to elevate each and every member of their audience to the kind of blissful place that only the most ecstatic live music can take you. Its a place filled with beauty and light, joy and power, love and community, all delivered with a heaping dose of pizazz.", "img": null, "title": "Pigeons Playing Ping Pong", "url": "http://eventful.com/jackson_wy/events/pigeons-playing-ping-pong-/E0-001-109162947-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Pink Garter Plaza", "city": "Jackson"}, {"date": "2018-02-09 20:00:00", "description": " with Broccoli Samurai, Official After Party w/ Kluster Phunk<br> &quot;We pour every ounce of ourselves into every note when we perform live, says Pigeons Playing Ping Pong singer/guitarist Greg Ormont.

But with a style that sometimes draws comparisons to JJ Cale and Daniel Lanois, this blues-influenced, New Orleans-inspired song and groove man, as hes been so aptly described, luckily found his rightful calling. Born in Quebec, his family moved to Boston when he was 12. He served a year in Vietnam as a Marine, struggled and overcame drug addiction, earned a pilots license in Colorado, then moved to Alaska, then Seattle, and Paris and New Orleans. But it took a close call while piloting a seaplane across the Canadian wilderness to make him decide it was time to get busy writing songs - gritty narratives inspired by a lifetime of hard-won knowledge set against his gritty, soulful guitar and harmonica playing.Hes since earned many accolades, including a Juno Award for his 1999 album, Gust of Wind. His post-Katrina ode, I Am the Big Easy, earned the International Folk Alliances 2009 Song of the Year Award, and in 2012, Bonneville won the solo/duet category in the Blues Foundations International Blues Challenge. He has guested on albums by Mary Gauthier, Gurf Morlix, Eliza Gilkyson, Ray Wylie Hubbard and other prominent artists, and shared songwriting credits with Tim OBrien, Phil Roy and Morlix, among others. Slaid Cleaves placed Bonnevilles Run Jolee Run on his lauded 2009 album, Everything You Love Will Be Taken Away.Ray is touring in support of Easy Gone, his fourth album for Red House Records. The album takes listeners to some of the dark spaces and exotic places Bonneville has gone on his own travels. An Austin resident since 2006, Bonneville still puts the rhythms and soul of New Orleans into much of his music.

Upon finishing school in 1974, he and his brother formed a trio and went on to change the face of folk music in North America with their performances that left audiences breathless, records which to date have sold in the millions, and songs which have been sung and recorded by thousands around the globe.<p>Upon Stan\u2019s untimely death in 1983, Garnet set out on his own, forming, along with his parents, one of the very first independent record labels in North America, long before \u201cIndies\u201d became fashionable. Thus far, Garnet has written and recorded 18 highly acclaimed records to date; received a Juno nomination; and recorded either solo or with Grammy nominated American folk icon Greg Brown, as well as legendary Scottish singer Archie Fisher (recently made a Member of the British Empire at Buckingham Palace). Garnet also authored and recently published a memoir called <em>Night Drive</em>, a wild, funny, and vulgar telling of his years on the road with his brother. <em>Night Drive</em> has received uniformly rave reviews in North America and Europe, and continues to sell well.<p>Resolutely avoiding the mainstream music industry, Garnet has refused all offers from large record labels, with the exception of a \u201cbest-of\u201d compilation done with the highly respected Minneapolis record label Red House Records, the largest independent roots music label in North America. His own record label and publishing company, Snow Goose Records, remains family run.<p>Over the years Garnet has worked or appeared with artists such as the late Bill Morrissey (a Grammy-nominated writer, singer, and best-selling author), Mary Chapin Carpenter (five time Grammy-winning singer), the late Guy Clark, Shawn Colvin, folk legends Judy Collins and Tom Paxton, acclaimed British producer Brian Eno, Daniel Lanois (fellow Canadian and noted producer for U2), Bluegrass legend Bill Monroe, Harry Connick Jr., and many others.<p>Venues where Garnet has played include the Kennedy Center for the Arts in Washington DC, Lincoln Center in New York City, and the Victoria Ballroom in Vancouver (as special musical guest in an evening honoring Nelson Mandela). As well, he has played at nearly every major music festival in North America, and hundreds of smaller concert halls and clubs around the continent, from Florida to the Yukon, Newfoundland to San Diego.<p>Garnet Rogers has been a guest on NPR shows All Things Considered, A Prairie Home Companion, Good Evening with Noah Adams, Fresh Air with Terry Gross; as well, he\u2019s appeared on West Virginia\u2019s Mountain Stage, CBC\u2019s As It Happens, The Vicki Gabereau show, \u201cQ\u201d with Tom Power, Morningside with Peter Gzowski, and Swinging on a Star with Murray Maclaughlan.<p>Garnet is to be the subject of a documentary in the coming year, intended to touch on the travels and travails that make up the story of his touring life. The documentary is to be directed by Jonathan Silvers, the noted filmmaker whose most recent three-part series, \u201cDead Reckoning: War, Crime, and Justice from WW2 to the War on Terror,\u201d was featured on PBS in spring 2017.<p>Garnet Rogers continues to write, to record, and to tour all across Canada and the States. He spends his off-time between his home in Nova Scotia and his farm in Ontario, where his wife, Gail Parker-Rogers, breeds and raises thoroughbred horses, several of which can currently be found are on the US and Canadian Olympic Teams.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>", "img": null, "title": "Garnet Rogers", "url": "http://toronto.eventful.com/events/garnet-rogers-/E0-001-107892220-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "Canada", "venue": "Hugh's Room", "city": "Toronto"}], "description": "Daniel Lanois (born September 19, 1951 in Hull,  Qu\u00e9bec  is a Canadian record producer and singer-songwriter. He has produced albums for a wide variety of artists and released a number of albums of his own work. Artists he has worked with include Bob Dylan, U2, Brian Eno, Peter Gabriel, Robbie Robertson, Chris Whitley, Ron Sexsmith and Nash the Slash.\n\nHe started his production career working in his own studio, Grant Avenue Studios in Hamilton, Ontario. He worked with a number of local bands, most notably Martha and the Muffins, for whom his sister Jocelyne played bass, Ray Materick, as well as the Canadian children's singer Raffi. \n\nAfter being discovered by Brian Eno and working collaboratively with him on some of Eno's own projects, his career was given a huge boost when Eno invited him to co-produce U2's album The Unforgettable Fire. Along with Eno, he went on to produce U2's The Joshua Tree, the 1987 Grammy Winner for Album of the Year. Bono of U2 recommended Lanois to Bob Dylan in the late 1980s; in 1989 Lanois produced Dylan's Oh Mercy, widely considered one of Dylan's greatest later albums. Eight years later Dylan and Lanois worked together on Time Out of Mind, Dylan's first studio album of original material since 1990, which won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1997.\n\nWrecking Ball, his 1995 collaboration with Emmylou Harris, received almost unanimous critical praise (many critics placed the album on their year-end \"best albums of the year\" lists), and revived the aging country artist's career, bringing her to the attention of much younger rock audiences.\n\nAs well as being a producer, singer and songwriter, Daniel Lanois plays the guitar, pedal steel and drums. His desire is to bring out the best in the artists he works with and produces, with his wide range of talents and musical ideas.  He often leaves an atmospheric and emotionally resonant sound on the projects he produces, which some say has become his 'signature sound'. \n\nDaniel founded Red Floor Records to release his own music albums and DVD films that he sells direct to consumers from his website in high resolution downloads and traditional formats: www.DanielLanois.com\n\nAfter completing production work on U2's latest album \"No Line In The Horizon\" in 2009, Daniel has built a new recording studio in Toronto, which he has named \"The Temple\", as it is located on the site of a former Buddhist Temple.  He recently completed producing Neil Young's latest 2010 release, \"Le Noise\". However, on June 5th, 2010, while working on Young's album, Daniel was in a serious motorcycle accident near his Silver Lake area home of Los Angeles, and he had to postpone his latest personal priority project, Black Dub which features Daniel on guitars, world renown drummer/percussionist Brian Blade, bassist and harmony vocalist Daryl Johnson, and lead vocalist/keyboardist Trixie Whitley (the daughter of the late Chris Whitley).  \n\nBlack Dub have been signed to Jive Records and they are expected to commence a world tour in early 2011 supporting their debut self titled release, and they are currently doing special engagements throughout November and early December 2010 across the USA. \n\nDaniel has recently written an autobiographical memoir entitled \"Soul Mining, A Musical Life\" that can be pre-ordered and is expected to be officially released through traditional book store channels in late November 2010.  \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Daniel+Lanois\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

We will discuss the properties of cacao while consuming a strong, spiced and sweetened drink of pure raw cacao from Guatemala. Isabel and Ari will be guiding the group through a journey using meditation, music, and powerful breath to open our hearts and clear our minds. The journey will close with a sound healing. Theobroma Cacao (translated=Food of the Gods) contains many beneficial health properties and has been used as a food for millennia and ceremonially by Mesoamerican cultures. It was once comparable to gold, used in trade and ceremonially to document life-milestones. When you consume cacao prepared for ceremony using high quality raw cacao beans, the mood enhancing neurochemicals in cacao become particularly active. There is increased blood flow and oxygen to the brain, heart and skin, the whole body is nourished, awareness and focus is heightened and sensations are intensified. This promotes deep relaxation and often space for emotional release. People often report a deep sense of joy and peace, a connection to the oneness as well as insights of limiting behaviors, thoughts and feelings that are able to be understood and released within the safe space of ceremony. Cacao contains the neurotransmitters serotonin, tryptophan and dopamine which assist with feelings of well-being, combat stress and anxiety and contribute to motivation. It also contains the neuromodulator phenylethylamine (PEA) which helps the body create feelings of excitement and euphoria. Cacao is one if the highest sources of anti-oxidants (specifically Flavonoids) and magnesium, and extremely beneficial to heart health and reducing blood pressure. Please wear comfortable clothing, you are welcome to bring a yoga mat and cushion. There will be some provided too. A blindfold can also be beneficial. If you are experiencing serious health challenges or are on high levels of anti-depressants, please contact us to discuss if this type of journey is safe for you.

If you have any concerns or serious health issues, it\u2019s important to disclose these prior to treatment to ensure that Kambo is suitable and safe for you to work with.\u00a0As an IAKP Kambo Practitioner abiding by the Code of Ethics and Professional Practice, confidentiality is taken seriously. Your personal and private information will not be disclosed to any third party without your consent, unless required by due process of the law.---CAUTIONS & CONSIDERATIONSExtra caution is required in the following cases. It&#39;s important to disclose any of these prior to treatment:- People taking slimming, serotonin and/or sleeping supplements.- People taking immune-suppressants for auto-immune disorders.- People with active drug or alcohol addictions.- People who have been fasting/water-fasting for 7 days Before (or After) Kambo.- People who have had enemas, colonics, liver flushes or any water based detox 3 days Before (or After) taking Kambo.It&#39;s also important to disclose any of the following prior to treatment:- If you&#39;re taking or have recently stopped taking any medications.- If you&#39;re taking or have recently stopped taking any diet/slimming pills.- If you&#39;re regularly taking anti-diuretic medication or sports drinks.- If you have ever been, or are currently bulimic or anorexic.- If you&#39;re epileptic.- If you have abnormally high or low blood pressure.- If you have liver or kidney problems.- If you have any chronic or serious health issues.- If you have asthma.- If you have diabetes.It&#39;s helpful to note that if you&#39;re menstruating at the time of your treatment, Kambo will most likely cause your flow to increase for 24 to 36 hours, due to it&#39;s vasodilation properties.---PREPARING FOR A KAMBO TREATMENT- Do not attempt any sort of water or dry fast 7 days before/after Kambo.- Do not begin any colonics, enemas, water based detox, liver flushes or sweat lodge 3 days before/after Kambo.- Do not take recreational drugs or drink alcohol 24-48 hours before/after Kambo.- Do not eat any food 12 hours before Kambo. It&#39;s important to fast for these 12 hours immediately prior to a Kambo treatment.- Do not drink coffee on the morning of your treatment.- Do not drink large amounts of water or fluid on the morning of your Kambo treatment.\u00a0- You can drink a hot tea on the morning of your Kambo treatment, and sip on small amounts of water. Do not add honey. This can disturb your electrolyte balance.- Stop all fluid intake 2 hours prior to your Kambo treatment.(You will be required to drink 1.5-2L of water 10-15 minutes immediately before your Kambo is applied, as part of the purging process. This is why it&#39;s important to avoid drinking excessive water beforehand, to avoid electrolyte imbalance, potentially lead to hyponatremia - dangerously low sodium levels)- Wear loose, comfortable clothing on the day of your Kambo treatment. Layers are always good, due to the potential flux in body temperature.- Remove tight, restrictive jewellery before your Kambo treatment, due to the potential swelling of body parts.- Try to make little to no plans for the remainder of your day after your treatment. You may need to rest and recuperate.If you are unsure about any of the preparation protocols, or have questions or concerns, please get in touch and ask prior to ceremony.---WHAT DO I BRING TO A KAMBO CEREMONY?- Loose, comfortable, non-restrictive clothing. You may be asked to roll up pant legs, shirt sleeves, or tie up clothes to access body parts depending on type of treatment and placement of Kambo.\u00a0- If you have a sarong, this is a good choice incase you get hot or need to remove clothing for Kambo applications.- A blanket, shawl, or something warm for resting afterwards.- A yoga mat to lay down on, and a cushion, pillow or something comfortable to sit and rest on.- 3L of regular drinking water at room-temperature, approximately half of which is to be drunk 10-15 minutes immediately Before taking Kambo.- Something to tie up long hair.- People with asthma should bring their inhaler with them (as a precautionary measure).- People with diabetes should bring their insulin, testing strips and extra food.- Your willingness and trust to surrender to the Great Spirit of Kambo.---Light food and refreshments will be available after ceremony.\u00a0It&#39;s recommended to drink some tea and eat something light to ground yourself and restore your electrolyte balance before leaving.If you feel called to bring something to share, please do.You will be fine to drive home after a short rest.

The gothic-octogenous doom melted together with hard rock and psychedelic elements of theirs is a good example proving the fact that the frightening sound evoking the seventies can not be so ultimately captivating only by the Ghost witchcraft.<br> <br><strong>DOOL (NL)</strong><br><p> After the dissolution of The Devil&#39;s Blood, the Dutch underground searched for the moonlight of the orchestra for the occult and organically sounding fresh sounds. This is how the A38 Ship was organized earlier in the Gozsdu Man\u00f3 Club, the death rock / post-punk band, GOLD, and DOLD, which was also a capitalist, could be formed by bass guitarist Job and drummer Micha&#39;s joint initiative. However, he could hardly have suspected that such a high visibility would be deserved so fast in the international vintage palette of the female doom. Blood Ceremony, fans of Jess and the Ancient Ones, or Blood Ceremony, have already begun a new favorite at the first video sharing of Prophecy Records, and DOOL&#39;s international march has been unbroken since then. The Here Now, Here Then song, released on the German Metal Hammer Awards, combines the hard rock of the seventies and King&#39;s X with both progressive and psychedelic traces of the 1970s with The Sisters of Mercy&#39;s Gothic Atmosphere and the Occult Doom&#39;s Conjecture so that its tone can only be realized in real life.

After a mind-numbing study of hundreds of trashy witchcraft films, the group began to pour their energies into crafting songs, transforming their fascination for horror into a profane musical vision. \n\nTheir sound bears witness to the heavy bands of yesteryear, fusing progressive rock elements with folk and an early '70s downer vibe. Invoking the mischievous Pipes of Pan, Blood Ceremony songs are distinguished by singer Alia O'Brien's flute solos - accenting an instrument long-associated with a list of devilish figures. \n\nA celebration of Euro-horror, '60s saturnalia and occult miscellanea, their self-titled debut was mixed by Billy Anderson and released by Rise Above in 2008 to enthusiastic reviews. In 2009, Blood Ceremony completed a successful European tour supporting doom legends Electric Wizard. \n\nLiving With The Ancients, Blood Ceremony's sophomore album, expands the group's dark and regal sound with a heavy dose of vintage organ, gritty guitars and stirring flute harmonies. The album was recorded in Chicago by Sanford Parker, who completed the final mixes on Samhain Day. With \"Living With the Ancients,\" Blood Ceremony continues its journey through the mire of ancient occultism and flute-infused downer rock. The album was released on March 1, 2011. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Blood+Ceremony\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They formed in December 2004 with Evan Pharmakis and Nick Lambert and recorded their first demo in a dorm room at MassArt using a drum Machine. Soon they recruited drummer Brandon Davis (who at the time was playing guitar for the band Therefore I Am), bassist Shawn Marquis, and vocalist Joe Bragel.\n\nThey then recorded and self released their first EP, This Will Be Our Little Secret.  The six song EP quickly helped the band gain a strong local fan base. It was this EP that helped them get noticed and on November 15, 2005, the band was signed to Epitaph Records. In March 2006, they released a split vinyl EP with Therefore I Am; only 500 copies were pressed.\n\nThey then began recording their Epitaph debut, but due to personal reasons Vanna and vocalist Joe Bragel decided to part ways. After the departure of Joe, they recruited Chris Preece to fill in the vocal spot. For various legal reasons Chris could not do the vocal parts, so Nick and Evan did the vocals on the record. The The Search Party Never Came EP was released June 6, 2006. After its release, the band toured for the whole summer and into the fall and on October 25th, they traveled to Seattle, Washington to record their first full length album with Producer Matt Bayles (Mastodon, Norma Jean, The Fall Of Troy, Pearl Jam). They recorded through November and up until December 19. After coming home they took the month of January off and in February began touring again with The Esoteric and playing a few Dates on the 2007 Epitaph Tour.\n\nOn January 23rd, 2007, the song The Things He Carried was released on Purevolume and featured vocals from Brendan Brown of The Receiving End Of Sirens. Their debut full-length, Curses, was released on April 24, 2007 under Epitaph.  Midway through their tour to support the album, drummer Brandon Davis left for personal reasons, stating that there was no bad blood between him and the band. He was eventually replaced by Chris Campbell, formerly of The Jonah Veil and Evertone. \n\nAfter months of touring, the band went into the studio to record their 2009 full length, A New Hope. A few months after its release in April, vocalist Chris Preece decided to part ways with the band due to personal reasons. He played his last show with the band during Warped Tour in Mansfield, MA, where he gave the mic to new vocalist, Davey Muise (formerly of Seeker Destroyer).\n\nA year and a half later, Vanna released The Honest Hearts EP under Artery Recordings on October 12, 2010. The EP included three new songs as well as re-recorded versions of A Dead Language for a Dying Lady (shortened to A Dead Language) and Trashmouth. Three months later, they headed back to the studio to record a new full-length, And They Came Baring Bones, with producer Matt Goldman. The album was released on June 21, 2011.\n\nVanna are currently on the road for the European Impericon Never Say Die! Tour 2011 which will last throughout the month of October with fellow bands Suicide Silence, Emmure, Deez Nuts, The Word Alive, As Blood Runs Black, and The Human Abstract. They are also preparing for their first DVD, Bring Me Your Bones, by holding a show which will take place on November 12, 2011 at the Worcester Palladium in Massachusetts. At the same time, they will also be touring throughout the US from early November to mid-December with fellow bands The Chariot, The Crimson Armada, Former Thieves, and Listener. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Vanna\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Yeah)\nThat means bring it back NY king of that\nThe best tried a dead mind but just can't see to that\nThe 4th comin' don't look now there's more comin'\nAnd we all stunnaz wit lil money but still hungry\nTrue story once threw a nigga from a two story\nAsked for my paper said there's nothin' he can do for me\nThat's like takin' a steak out of a lions mouth\nBetta yet that like takin' a plate outta Ryans mouth\nThat'll neva happen ova my dead body\nFeds got me plastered on the wall like I'm the heir to Gotti\nI swear to Mambo and Nore and all the left wreck\nA nigga try front on his body he gettin' sent back\nDon't resent Crack I'm just what you wanna be\nYoung rich and famous bitches can't get enough of me\nAnd they runnin' up on me usually in groups of them\nBut not just everyday

and went to war wit the law\nMy only pencil was a mug shot slugs were thugs got pot\nGet swellin hops from sellin tops to da drugs spot\nG's was clocked fat knots was in the socks\nAnd cops who tried to stop shop got knocked when I popped the glock\nShit was ran right by me and my man Mike\n'Cause I choose to use a gun don't mean that I can't fight\n'Cause we put the guns down and go one round\nWit the hands but man I ain't the one, you'll get done clown\nI can inverse my style, 'cause I'm versitile\nQuick to burst a child I'm livin' worse than foul\nI pack two techs in case ya crew flex\nI wet up the set in a second yell whos next\nTo feel the wrath of a psychopath shoots it up like Shaft\nTurn ya staff into a blood bath to laugh\nYou'll get smashed like a deli snack, you softer than jelly jack\nI attack in black wit a gat and a skully hat\n\nI just had to bring 'em back\n{All my friends call me stout}\nYou know I had to bring 'em back yo\n(Flamboyant baby)\nI just had to

Hall turnin' fiends a full\nFrom Meda ward to Sacuon the same sad song\nIs bein sung, it's like gimmie a gun and I'm back on\nJoey Crack, Pun, TS, Bronx regulators\nStomp little niggaz to death for tryin' to imitate us\nY'all could neva see us, be us, TS, kill da bs\nCause Pun got more guns and funds than Undeas\nUn be us, I'm from the BX so I have to roll\nBlast the 4 crash ya door smash ya hoe\nHack off ya skull, I'm stackin heads like totem poles\nBlow a hole in ya colon throw you from here to Fordan road\nBlow fa blow, I toe to toe with the toughest\nBring the ruckas to the roughest muthafucka its nothin' but luckstress\nMy crews are cussin to bustin' ass crushin glass\nIn niggaz faces leavin' traces of red out this bloody bath\nI want the cash off the jiddump, I cock and blast the piddump\nAt any piddunk tryin' to laugh at the Briddonx\nYou ain't no kiddon for the Terror Squadron\nYou feel the fear of God when I steal a car and flatten ya Pierre Cardan\nI peirce ya noggin if you startin trouble, spark the dot above you\nAnd watch it blossom like a flower throughout the borough\nNo doubt I'm thorough with a parascope rifle extended rycle\nCycle that'll tear the whole Bible out\nI'm sweatin no idols a title's all I request\nBest rappers know that Pun and Y the chaperones of death...\n\nI just had to bring 'em back\n(Word you definitely know what I'm about)\nYou

fight, but I ain't been scufflin since\nThis is as tough as it gets, never leave nothin' with prints\nOr you get blast and you're chopped up and stuffed in the fridge\nThey not playin' me, I perfected this game from a to z\nThe ones I don't know will need ropes to hands and knees\n\n(Verse 2: prospect)\nThis shit'll never stop, as long as I live, I'ma forever rock\nAnd stop niggas right where they standin when the baretta pop\n\n\nMy moms said I better not, but knew I had to\nI said, \"I'm bustin' mines, and ain't nobody movin at you\"\nShe laughed too, like I was jokin, when I'm chrome-totin\nI have a nigga in his home hopin I don't blow his dome open\nI stay stoned, smokin' while I'm on the low, I'm copin\nA cool guy, but at times you catch me tone-locin\nBeen through a lotta shit, but never had a bone broken\nIt's tragic how I rap shit with my own potion\n>From here to hoboken I was hoppin trains with no token\nNow I'm on stage, they say I'm show-boatin\nMy flow potent, 'cause it's mixed in raw\nSpell it backwards, it's 'war'\nThe gat spits, you backflip through the door\nI kill 'em all, terror squadian style\nI only get down with the crown, only partyin wild\nYa heard\n\nNow everybody from b-k, throw 'em up\nNow everybody from new jerz, throw 'em up\nNow everybody from q-b, throw 'em up\nNow everybody from the b-x, throw 'em up\nNow everybody from staten island, throw 'em up\nTo all my partners from westside, throw 'em up\nNow everybody from the east coast, throw 'em up\nIf you dirty like the south, throw 'em up\nYou better throw 'em up\n\nMy

ABOUT THE TOUR: The Symbionese Liberation Army, an alleged left wing radical group, kidnapped newspaper heiress Patty Hearst in Berkeley in February 1974. Three months later in South Los Angeles, the kidnappers engaged almost 500 law officers in a standoff that was broadcast on national TV, culminating in a shootout and fire in which six members of the group were killed. In this special bus adventure, originally presented as part of Esotouric\u2019s tenth anniversary celebrations, author Brad Schreiber (&quot;Revolution\u2019s End&quot;) takes us to four significant SLA locations, revealing the incredible, true story of prison drug experiments, gun-running, undercover agents and the suppressed lover\u2019s quarrel that resulted in the most famous kidnapping in US history. It\u2019s a story that has waited forty years to be fully told, and which will unfold on and off the bus as we explore the radical culture of 1960s and 1970s South Los Angeles and beyond. Also joining us on this edition of the tour is another favorite Esotouric and forensic science seminar guest host, Mike Digby. For his contribution to the tour, Mike will provide a detective\u2019s interpretation of the LAPD\u2019s pursuit of the SLA, both leading up to the February 1974 standoff, and in the fractured group\u2019s continued terror campaigns that followed that event. Please note that this is a Special Event, and vouchers and discounts good on our regularly scheduled bus adventures are not accepted for this tour.

Based in The Bronx borough of New York City, the members of Terror Squad collectively debuted on a song in member Fat Joe's album Don Cartagena. Terror Squad released its eponymous debut, The Album, in 1999, with its first major hit \"Whatcha Gon' Do\", credited mostly to Big Pun, who died of a heart attack in 2000. After Big Pun's death, his longtime partners Cuban Link and Triple Seis left the group and were subsequently replaced by Remy Martin (later known as Remy Ma) and Tony Sunshine.\n\nIn 1998, the members of Terror Squad debuted as a group on Fat Joe's album Don Cartagena. Terror Squad in its debut album Terror Squad: The Album consisted of rappers Fat Joe, Big Pun, Cuban Link, Prospect, Armageddon, and Triple Seis. \n\nAs the group was on hiatus following Pun's death, most of its former members fell into obscurity, with Fat Joe having the most successful solo career among all the former members.\n\nThe group reunited and released their second album, True Story, in 2004. It included the summer club hit \"Lean Back,\" produced by Scott Storch, which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and 24 in the UK. A remix to \"Lean Back\" featured Lil Jon, Mase and Eminem was released on Fat Joe's 2005 album All or Nothing.

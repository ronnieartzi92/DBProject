The line, \"Who is this irresistible creature who has an insatiable love for the dead?\" in the beginning of the song is from the trailer of the film, Lady Frankenstein. The music in the beginning of the song is taken from the trailer of the Wes Craven film, The Last House on the Left. This song was also Shelly Martinez entrance themes in Ohio Valley Wrestling. In this song, Zombie sings, \"Goldfoot's machine creates another fiend so beautiful they make you kill\". This relates to the villain played by Vincent Price in the 1965 film Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine and the 1966 film Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs. Also, he sings \"Operation Filth they love to love the wealth of an SS whore making scary sounds.\" This is possibly a reference to the notorious 1974 film Ilsa: She-Wolf of the SS.\nThe song also appears on Rob Zombie's Past, Present & Future, the greatest hits album The Best of Rob Zombie, and a remix is contained on American Made Music to Strip By. The original mix was featured in both Bride of Chucky and Gus Van Sant's Psycho remake, appearing on the album of the latter, the \"Naked Exorcism Mix\" appeared on the The Crow: Salvation Soundtrack in 2000. The song was covered by Sinus Giddy for The Electro-Industrial Tribute to Rob Zombie in 2002. Also a version of the song is played in a club in the TV show Angel, while the character Faith tears apart a dance club. The sleeve for the CD single features an image Rob Zombie's wife Sheri Moon.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rob+Zombie/_/Living+Dead+Girl\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He was the former lead singer for the rock/metal group White Zombie, and later became a successful solo artist, disbanding the group after his first solo album, the 1998  release Hellbilly Deluxe, sold more in the first week than any of the band's albums ever did.  Remixes of some of its tracks were released on 1999's American Made Music To Strip By, followed up by the studio release The Sinister Urge in 2001.  \n\nIn 2003 he made his directorial debut with the release of the film 'House of 1000 Corpses' to a lukewarm reception, though it garnered quite a cult-following. Its sequel, 'The Devil's Rejects,' was released in 2005. It was received much better than the first film, even getting the 'thumbs up' from well-known film critic Roger Ebert. Also in his films is his wife Sheri Moon Zombie.\n\nIn March 2006, he released his newest album, entitled \"Educated Horses\". The album was a more stripped down, raw rock record, and quite a departure from the techno-industrial feel of the old Zombie albums. While this change, along with Zombie's change of appearance (he lost the dreadlocks and went back to his natural hair color, blonde), upset many of his fans, it allowed Rob to experiment with his style without deviating from his core fan base.\n\nThe new album also featured two new band members. John 5, of Marilyn Manson fame, and Tommy Clufetos, the former drummer for Ted Nugent and Alice Cooper, replaced Mike Riggs and John Tempesta, who had left the band in 2003 to work on other projects.\n\nHellbilly Deluxe 2, released in February 2010,  is the first release where Rob Zombie worked with his full touring band. Previous albums were written and recorded by Rob Zombie himself and a rotating set of musicians. Commenting on the change, Zombie stated, \"I've always had a revolving roster of studio and touring musicians, but the three guys in my band now have been on tour with me for years. So we're making it as a band. It's called Rob Zombie, but we're treating it like a band.\n\nHis half-brother, Michael Cummings is the lead singer of Powerman 5000. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rob+Zombie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The release was confirmed in a MTV News article and chosen before polling ended for Ciara's second single on her Official Myspace page, being picked over \"That's Right\" and \"Can't Leave 'Em Alone\". Although the single was a moderate hit, it failed to match the success of its North American predecessor.\n\n\"Like a Boy\" details about double standards in society of how men in relationships can do certain things, but when women do the same it is looked down upon. According to Ciara, \"it's a record for my women\" and she had \"a lot of girl talks\". Ciara wanted to know what it would be like if \"the roles were reversed\". \"It's a female-empowerment record\". The protagonist wishes to \"act like a boy\". The song is notable for its mixture of synthesized orchestral strings and hard-pounding hip-hop instrumental. Ciara also co-produced the song along with The Evolution track \"My Love\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ciara/_/Like+a+Boy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Justin Timberlake.

The single was co-written by and features Justin Timberlake with production coming from new production group The Y's. After receiving heavy airplay on US radio from February 20, 2009, it was made available for download in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US from March 17. It was released as a download in the UK and Europe on April 5, 2009.\n\nCiara and Timberlake performed the song on Saturday Night Live and Ciara went on to perform the song alone on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and Jimmy Kimmel Live. She also performed it in London in The Circus: Starring Britney Spears tour, as apart of her opening act set. The \"Love Sex Magic\" video has been nominated for Best Choreography in a Video, by the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nSince the single's release, it has become Ciara's biggest international hit to date, charting in the top ten in numerous countries worldwide, and peaking at number one in several countries including Taiwan, India, and Turkey.\n\nBillboard.com editor Chris Williams gives the single a favorable review, saying:\n\n    \"the pair definitely has chemistry, trading off heated vocals that add fire to an already spicy lyric: \"I ain't gonna stop you if you wanna crowd my neck/Talk sexy to me like that.\" It has a subtle retro funk groove generates enough sparks of its own to entice the pop crowd onto the dancefloor.\"\n\nEditor Lauren Carter from the Boston Herald writes that the song is \"not quite magic, but it grows on you.\" Ryan Brockington of New York Post's online website Popwrap says that the record sounds roughly like Justin Timberlake's single, \"Rock Your Body\", from his debut album Justified.\n\nBill Lamb of About.com felt that while the song \"doesn't have the lyrical potency of 'Like a Boy'\", he gave the song a generally positive review, saying that \"fans of sparkling dance-pop are likely to smile\". He also wrote that the \"vocal magnetism between Ciara and Justin\" is \"real\" and refreshing. Lamb also notes that it \"rides a beat that brings simultaneous echoes of 70's R&B and classic Janet Jackson\".\n\nDigital Spy gave the song a positive review: \"it's a squelchy electro-funk tune powered by a bassline that practically goads your pelvis into grinding. \"Imagine if there was a million me's talking sexy to you like that,\" Ciara purrs, and Timberlake, if you'll pardon the pun, more than rises to the occasion. All in all, 'Love Sex Magic' is pretty much spot on\".\n\nThe single officially impacted Top 40/Mainstream radio on March 3, 2009. The song debuted at number 86 on the Billboard Hot 100 but managed to jump to 27 in its second week. In the following week the song rose to number 10. This has been Ciara's biggest radio single since \"Oh\" featuring Ludacris, which reached number six on the Billboard Pop 100 chart in mid 2005.\n\nThe song also reached the Top 10 on Canadian Hot 100, which is her first Top 10 in Canada since reaching number one there in 2004 with \"1, 2 Step\". In Australia, the song debuted at #6, whilst in New Zealand \"Love Sex Magic\" debuted at number 14.\n\nOn April 12, 2009 \"Love Sex Magic\" entered the UK Singles Chart at number six on downloads alone, before moving up to number five on its second week, becoming Ciara's highest charting single in the UK since \"Oh\" reached #4 in 2005. It has also reached #1 the UK R&B Singles Chart.\n\nCiara first appeared in the UK charts in January 2005 with the No.1 smash 'Goodies'. 'Love Sex Magic' was co-written by and features Justin Timberlake and hit the top 5 in April 2009. The racy video for the track was inspired by the Crazy Horse Cabaret Club in Paris. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ciara/_/Love+sex+magic\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Written by The-Dream and produced by Tricky Stewart, the song serves as the album's third single (fourth overall) in the United States whilst Work is released in international markets.\n\nThe single's promotion began with MTV.

So far it has been released through airplay on June 15, 2009 and peaked at 59 on the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Chart.\n\nIt was first confirmed on Ciara's official Twitter page that she would be filming videos for two singles simulatiously although at that time it was not clear which singles would be released. Now it is confirmed that \"Work\" will be released to International markets while \"Like a Surgeon\" will receive the video and single treatment in North America. It was released to radio on June 15, 2009.\n\nPrior to its release, the single debuted 92 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart in the June 13, 2009 issue of Billboard magazine, based solely on its single confirmation and radio airplay.\n\nAlthough initially confirmed to receive a video and full single treatment, as of October 2009 the song was only released to selected US radio stations.

The album is his love letter to Nashville, filled with songs of sin, dangerous women, beautiful tarnished losers, undying love and equally undying friendship.But first, he had to make the space for it. Dan Auerbach had toured constantly since forming The Black Keys with Patrick Carney back in 2001. After an especially grueling five-year stretch, touring around three Black Keys studio albums, and a lengthy tour with the Arcs that ended in late August 2016, Auerbach realized he needed to unplug for a while. Not because he was planning on recording a solo album; more that he just needed to stop. When I finally told myself that I needed a break, that was probably the start of this album, explains Auerbach.But stopping didnt mean that Auerbach even considered relaxing. It just meant that he didnt tour. During the summer, he produced seven albums and finally got acquainted with the city he loves so much and some of the world-class musicians who live in it.I was on the road too much and didnt have the time to stop and really take part in what was here in Nashville. I was too consumed with my day job to ever build relationships with any of them until this summer. says Auerbach.The key to these relationships was Dave Ferguson, one of Nashvilles most respected engineers and producers, mentored by the late, great Cowboy Jack Clement and a longtime collaborator of Johnny Cashs on all his records for American Recordings.Im just remembering now that Fergie was with me when I bought my old Ford Truck on Craigslist from this old guy in East Nashville. He basically took me under his wing when I first got to Nashville eight years ago.But most importantly, he introduced Auerbach to most of the musicians he knows and now runs with in Nashville. He introduced me to some of his favorite people in townwriters he thought Id click with, and most of the time he was right. Thats who basically all the people on this record are.Fergie took me to the Station Inn to see John Prine play. I knew of him, of course, but I didnt know his stuff too well. But when I saw him live, I couldnt believe how amazing he was. Fergie introduced me to Cowboy Jack Clement. Wed go to Cowboys house and listen to him play songs on his ukulele and tell us stories. To think Cowboy was at my studio waltzing around the live room floor to my music and now I know Im part of that tradition that stretches all the way back to Cowboy and Sam Phillips opening up Sun Studios in Memphisit changed my whole universe, says Auerbach softly.And it changed the way he made records, working seven days a week, co-writing songssomething Auerbach had never really done before, certainly not in such a structured way.Every morning Auerbach, Ferguson and singer-songwriter Pat McLaughlin, who plays mandolin in John Prines band, would get together at nine oclock sharp to write.Theyd come over, Mackie would bring coffee, and wed be in a little room in my house with the door closed, and wed just write. I didnt do anything but work seven days a week. Monday through Wednesday wed write, and then Thursday through Sunday wed record, every week, says Auerbach.Recording might mean laying down tracks with distinguished session guitarist Russ Pahl; or bassist Dennis Crouch, co-founder of the Time Jumpers; or world-class Dobro player Jerry Douglas; or Dave Roe, whom Auerbach first saw on the tiny stage at Roberts Western World on Lower Broadway during his first trip to Nashville nineteen years ago.I am working with some of the greatest musicians that ever lived. When I met [keyboardist] Bobby Wood and [drummer] Gene Chrisman, it was like I finally met my soulmates. Ive always had a problem that I work so much. These guys, theyre not normal. Theyre as addicted to it as I am. Nobody that I play music with now got into music to meet girls, laughs Auerbach.Just to be clear, Im not hanging out with these guys just to hang out with old dudes. These guys are still full of fire. The thing is, Nashville is such a Cheesecake Factory of country music, and these guys sometimes dont fit in because they have so much personality in their playing.The roster includes iconic guitarist Duane Eddy, who had sold twelve million records by the time he was twenty-four, with songs such as Rebel Rouser and Peter Gunn, all produced by Lee Hazelwood. Eddy plays guitar on two of the albums songs, the stinging Livin in Sin and the more cinematic King of a One Horse Town.All I knew was whenever Duane picked up the guitar, it blew my mind, relates Auerbach, still awed that the great guitar genius is among his circle of friends. I just couldnt believe it, because its hard to take an instrument that everybodys heard six million times, and when he starts playing, its instantly identifiable as Duane Eddy.Sometimes I feel I created my own Field of Dreams. I built the studio because I knew something was going to happen. I built it to accommodate live musicians playing, and then all of a sudden the best musicians in Nashville show up, and its happening. Top session musicians in the world are texting me just to make sure they dont book other sessions, because they just dont want to miss anything.And it seems not many of them did. Auerbach wrote seven songs with John Prinethe one that made the album is the title songseventy-five songs with Pat McLaughlin, forty songs with L. Russell Brown, twenty songs with Roger Cook, and twenty with Bobby Wood, one of which was Show Me, which ends the album.I had this gut-string acoustic that I hadnt picked up in years and once I did all of a sudden it became a springboard for me and it just seemed to have all these songs in it, says Auerbach.All in all, there were about 200 songs. But only ten are on the album. I really love the idea of having a concise album, he says.Album standout Shine on Me just seemed to drop out of the ether, and didnt seem that extraordinary to Auerbach at first. The day I wrote Shine on Me, wed probably written three others. It was just another song we wrote, trying to make each other laugh and just trying to have fun. Then I got the idea about having Mark Knopfler on it. Id never met him, but I remember hearing his records when I was a kid. I remember how my dad would always scream at the radio when they faded out the Sultans of Swing solo at the end prematurely. He would get pissed off. I reached out to Knopfler, and two days later he sent something back.Knopflers snaky, snarling guitarimmediately identifiableelevates the twangy, twitchy rocker into an anthem so catchy and addictive it belies the rather disturbing lyrics about some of the baser qualities about human nature, in the same way sunshine pop conceals its dark interior.Knopfler was just as taken as Auerbach by the experience, explaining, Dan Auerbach is his own man. He goes from strength to strength. It was great to be a part of his record. Walk on, Dan.Hes not the only one impressed with the musician. Duane Eddy had all but given up on music before Auerbach asked him to appear on the record. I was really jaded before I met Dan, but working with him every day has brought back my old love for being in the studio, and I am truly inspired again. His enthusiasm just made it all fun again for me, says the legendary guitarist.Someone asked me recently who my favorite singer was, and I told them it was Dan. As a vocalist I compare him to George Jones and Ray Charles.As for Auerbach, the always-understated musician is just happy to have his own version of the Wrecking Crew at his Easy Eye Studio in south Nashville. Id call them that, but Duane really was in the Wrecking Crew, he says. Instead, Fergie and I call it the Easy Eye Sound. This is the sound I was looking for, and now there really is an Easy Eye sound. Our instruments dont move. The drums havent moved in two years. I mean nothing moves. Weve done seven, eight, nine records like this. We found our thing. Its a factorybut in the way that Motown is a factory, or that Stax was a factory, or that American Studios was a factory. Anything can happen, any day. He says, pausing a long minute, as if to let it all sink in. The dream realized.You know, some people are just late bloomers, he muses. Even with the success Ive had, its only just now that Im finally finding myself. I called the album Waiting On A Song because Ive been waiting my whole life to be able to do this. And now I have. And none of us ever want it to stop.", "img": null, "title": "Dan Auerbach & The Easy Eye Sound Revue", "url": "http://washingtondc.eventful.com/events/dan-auerbach-easy-eye-sound-revue-/E0-001-109137088-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "9:30 Club", "city": "Washington"}, {"date": "2018-03-28 20:00:00", "description": " with with special guest Shannon And The Clams<br> Eight-time GRAMMYwinner, Dan Auerbach announces the 20-date Easy Eye Sound Revue Tour, featuring Robert Finley and Shannon Shaw, with special guests Shannon & the Clams.

A multi-instrumentalist, Auerbach is best-known as the guitarist and vocalist for The Black Keys, a blues/rock group from Akron, Ohio.\n\nAuerbach grew up in a family with musical roots. His second cousin once removed was the late guitarist Robert Quine, an American guitarist known for his innovative guitar solos. Auerbach became infatuated with blues music during his childhood after being exposed to old records by his father. Auerbach often uses an index finger fingerpick along with his thumb to play chords, a technique similar to many earlier blues players. \n\nFormerly of the three piece Akron band The Barnburners from 2000 until 2002, Auerbach formed The Black Keys with drummer Patrick Carney.\n\nAuerbach released a solo album - Keep It Hid - in 2009. Auerbach played most of the instruments on the album, with his cousin James Quine contributing rhythm guitar on two songs and harmony vocals on two more. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dan+Auerbach\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was written as a tribute to the late actress Marilyn Monroe, as singer Joe Elliott often stated before playing the song live onstage. When released as a single it reached #1 on the Billboard Top Tracks chart and #12 on the Pop Singles chart. In 2006 the song was used in promotional ads for the DVD release of Blades of Glory. In 2009 it was named the 13th  greatest hard rock song of all time by VH1.\n\nThe 1993 live recording of the song in Sheffield, England appeared in the music video game Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock as part of a Def Leppard downloadable track pack, as did the 1993 live recording of \"Rock of Ages\". The song was also included in the tracklisting of the rhythm music video game Battle Of The Bands. In 2008 they performed the song with country star Taylor Swift on CMT Crossroads.\n\nJoe Elliott comented on the Vault album that this song was a big hit in the US and that he felt disappointed that it didn't become a hit in the UK. Nationally syndicated sports talk show host Jim Rome commonnly refers to \"Photograph\" as one of the all time great rock songs ever.\n\nThere are two versions of the music video. The uncensored version shows a knife scene at the beginning, and on the censored version of the video, it is almost the same except the knife scene is replaced with a stationary black cat. There are several appearances by the late Marilyn Monroe in the video, as the song is actually about her and lead singer Joe Elliot's declaration that he doesn't \"want her photograph\" but that that's all he's got and he must admire her from afar.\n\nThe music video was directed by David Mallet and was shot on Thursday, December 2, 1982 (Bassist Rick Savage's 22nd birthday), in Battersea, London, England. It featured the video debut of guitarist Phil Collen.\n\nThe All-American Rejects performed a cover version to this song live on VH1 Rock Honors. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Def+Leppard/_/Photograph\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Largely on the strength of their albums Pyromania and Hysteria, Def Leppard became one of the top-selling rock bands throughout the 1980s, selling over 65 million albums worldwide, including over 35 million in the United States alone. \n\nRick Savage (bass), Pete Willis (guitar), and Tony Kenning (drums), all students at Tapton School in Sheffield, formed a band called Atomic Mass in 1977. Following a chance meeting with Willis after missing a bus, 18-year old Joe Elliott tried out for the band as a guitarist. During his audition, however, it was decided that he was better suited to be the lead singer.\n\nSoon afterward they adopted a name proposed by Elliott, \"Deaf Leopard\", which was originally a band name he thought up while writing reviews for imaginary rock bands in his English class. At Kenning's suggestion, the spelling was slightly modified in order to make the name seem less like that of a punk band. In January of 1978, Steve Clark joined the band. According to Joe Elliott, he successfully auditioned for the band by playing Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Freebird\" in its entirety.\n\nIn November, just prior to recording sessions for what would be a three-song release known as the Def Leppard EP, Kenning abruptly left the band. He was replaced for those sessions by Frank Noon. By the end of the month Rick Allen, then only 15 years old, had joined the band as its full-time drummer.\n\nSales of the EP soared after the track \"Getcha Rocks Off\" was given extensive airtime by renowned BBC Radio DJ John Peel, considered at the time to be a champion of punk rock and new wave music.\n\nThroughout 1979, the band developed a loyal following among British hard rock/heavy metal fans and were even initially considered the leaders of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (a status eventually claimed by Iron Maiden). Their growing popularity led to a record deal with the major label Phonogram/Vertigo (Mercury Records in the US).\n\nDef Leppard's debut album, On Through the Night, was released on March 14, 1980. Although the album hit the Top 15 in the UK, many early fans were turned off by the perception that the band was trying too hard to appeal to American audiences[citation needed] by recording songs like \"Hello America\" and touring more in the US (supporting Pat Travers, AC/DC, and Ted Nugent). A performance at the Reading Festival in August (Iron Maiden also appeared) was marred when audience members expressed their displeasure by pelting the band with rubbish.\n\nThe band had by then caught the attention of AC/DC producer Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, who agreed to work on their second album, High 'n' Dry, released on July 11, 1981. Lange's meticulous approach in the studio helped them realize their potential.\n\nDespite the album's unimpressive sales figures, the \"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\" promo clip became one of the first metal videos played on MTV in 1982, bringing the band increased visibility in the States. By the time the album was out, a European tour followed. The band opened for Ozzy Osbourne and Blackfoot.\n\nPhil Collen, former guitarist with the glam band Girl, replaced Pete Willis, who was fired on July 11, 1982, due to excessive alcohol consumption on the job. (Willis would later resurface with the bands Gogmagog and Roadhouse.) This personnel change took place during the recording of their third album, Pyromania, which was released on January 20, 1983 and also produced by Lange.\n\nThe lead single, \"Photograph,\" turned Def Leppard into a household name, supplanting Michael Jackson's \"Beat It\" as the most requested video clip on MTV and becoming a staple of rock radio (dominating the US Album Rock Charts for six weeks). It also hit #12 on the pop charts.\n\nFueled by \"Photograph\" and subsequent singles \"Rock of Ages\" and \"Foolin',\" Pyromania went on to sell six million copies in 1983 (more than 100,000 copies every week in that year) and was held off the top of the US album charts only by Michael Jackson's Thriller. The album has since been certified Diamond by the RIAA in the US.\n\nDef Leppard's US tour in support of Pyromania began by opening for Billy Squier in March and ended with a headlining performance before an audience of 55,000 at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego, CA in September.\n\nAs a testament to the band's popularity at the time, a US Gallup poll in 1984 saw Def Leppard voted as favourite rock band over peers such as The Rolling Stones, AC/DC, and Journey. However, this popularity was not matched in their native England, a fact that greatly bothered them.\n\nFollowing their breakthrough, the band moved to Dublin in February 1984 for tax purposes to begin writing the follow-up to Pyromania. Mutt Lange initially joined in on the songwriting sessions but then suddenly declined to return as producer due to exhaustion. Instead, Jim Steinman (of Meat Loaf's Bat out of Hell fame) was brought in.\n\nOn December 31, 1984, drummer Rick Allen lost his left arm in a car crash on the A57 in the hills outside Sheffield when his speeding Corvette swerved off the road on a sharp bend and went through a drystone wall. Despite the severity of the accident, Rick was committed to continuing his role as Def Leppard's drummer. He practiced drumming with pillows and realized that he could use his legs to do some of the drumming work previously done with his arms. He then worked with Simmons to design a custom electronic drum kit.\n\nThe other members of the band supported Allen's recovery and never sought a replacement. During this period, Mutt Lange eventually returned to the fold as producer, and Allen's triumphant comeback was sealed at the 1986 Donington Monsters of Rock festival with an emotionally charged ovation after his introduction by Joe Elliott.\n\nDef Leppard's fourth album, Hysteria, was finally released on August 3, 1987. The second single from the album, \"Animal,\" reached #6 in the UK and finally turned the band into stars in their home country. Hysteria immediately topped the charts in its first week of release.\n\nUS album sales were relatively slow (compared to Pyromania) until the fourth single, \"Pour Some Sugar on Me.\" The song hit Number 2, and Hysteria finally reached the top of the US Album Charts in July 1988. The \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\" video was #1 on Dial MTV for a record 73 days (from May 26-September 5, 1988). In October, the power ballad \"Love Bites\" would become Def Leppard's first (and only) Number One single on the Billboard Hot 100, and in January 1989, the band scored another US Top 5 hit with \"Armageddon It.\"\n\nHysteria is one of only a handful of albums (and the third in rock history) that has charted seven singles or more on the US Hot 100: \"Women\" (#80), \"Animal\" (#19), \"Hysteria\" (#10), \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\" (#2), \"Love Bites\" (#1), \"Armageddon It\" (#3), and \"Rocket\" (#12). It remained on the charts for three years and has sold 18 million copies worldwide.\n\nEqually successful was the accompanying Hysteria World Tour, which ran for 15 months and saw Def Leppard perform \"In The Round.\" The concept proved wildly popular with fans, as evidenced in the videos for \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\" and \"Armageddon It\" (and was later used again for the Adrenalize tour).\n\nIn 1989, Def Leppard won Favorite Heavy Metal Artist, as well as Favorite Heavy Metal Album (for \"Hysteria\") during the American Music Awards. It was the first time that a heavy metal category was added to the awards show. (The category has since been deleted.)\n\nBy the end of the decade, although Guns N' Roses, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, and Bon Jovi had garnered more mainstream exposure, Def Leppard had sold more records than any rock band in the US during the '80s, except Van Halen and Journey.\n\nFollowing Hysteria, the band quickly set out to work on their fifth album, hoping to avoid another lengthy gap. However, Steve Clark's alcoholism worsened to the point that he was constantly in and out of rehab. Recording sessions suffered from this distraction, and in mid-1990, Steve was granted a six-month leave of absence from the band.\n\nClark never reached the end of his leave, dying from an accidental mix of prescription drugs and alcohol on January 8, 1991 in his London home. The remaining band members decided to carry on and recorded the album as a four-piece, with Collen mimicking Clark's style on his intended guitar parts.\n\nDef Leppard's fifth album, Adrenalize, was finally released on March 31, 1992. The album simultaneously entered at Number One on both the UK and US album charts, staying on the latter for 5 weeks. The first single, \"Let's Get Rocked,\" was an instant smash hit, and its video was later nominated for Best Video of the Year at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nIn April 1992, guitarist Vivian Campbell, formerly of Dio and Whitesnake, joined Def Leppard, making his \"official\" live debut with his band at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert (although they had done a short \"warm-up\" tour of the UK and Europe to work out any kinks of playing to a live audience with a new member and new material after almost 3 years off). Adrenalize yielded six hit singles and sold 7 million copies worldwide. Another world tour followed, but the band's fortunes began to be affected by the rise of grunge and alternative rock.\n\nA collection of b-sides and unreleased tracks recorded between 1984 and 1993, called Retro Active, was released in October 1993, preceded by the success of \"Two Steps Behind\" (from the Arnold Schwarzenegger film Last Action Hero). Another single, \"Miss You In A Heartbeat\", hit the Top 5 in Canada, becoming one of their biggest hits there. Retro Active has sold 3 million copies worldwide to date.\n\nTwo years later, Def Leppard issued their first greatest hits collection, Vault: Def Leppard Greatest Hits (1980\u20131995), which has sold 8 million copies worldwide. Alternate track listings of the album were issued for North America, the UK, and Japan.\n\nThe compilation included a new track, the ballad \"When Love & Hate Collide,\" which became their biggest ever hit in the UK, hitting #2. It peaked at #58 in the U.S. On October 23, 1995, the band entered the Guinness Book of World Records by performing three concerts in three continents in one day (Tangiers, Morocco; London, England; and Vancouver, Canada).\n\nSlang, released in May 1996, marked a drastic musical departure for the band by featuring darker lyrics and a stripped-down alternative rock edge. The US audience reception for Slang and its subsequent tour was a major dropoff from a decade earlier, but Q Magazine would nonetheless list Slang as one of the Top Ten Albums of 1996. This album was the first recorded performance of Rick Allen playing a semi-acoustic drum kit since his accident, and not his electronic set as was first used with Hysteria.\n\nVH1 revived the band's fortunes in the US in 1998 by featuring them on one of the first episodes of Behind The Music. Reruns of the episode yielded some of the series' highest ratings and brought the band's music back into the public consciousness (following years of burial by the alternative rock climate). The episode was even parodied on Saturday Night Live.\n\nIn an effort to capitalise on this new momentum, Def Leppard returned to its classic sound with the 1999 album Euphoria. The first single, \"Promises\", reunited the band with Mutt Lange and hit the US Mainstream Rock charts at #1 for 3 weeks. The album was certified gold in the US and Canada.\n\nOn September 5, 2000, Def Leppard were inducted into the Rock Walk of Fame on Hollywood's Sunset Boulevard by their friend Brian May of Queen.\n\nIn 2001, VH1 produced and aired Hysteria - The Def Leppard Story, a biopic that included Anthony Michael Hall as Mutt Lange and Amber Valletta as Lorelei Shellist (Steve Clark's girlfriend). The docudrama covered the band's history between 1977 through 1988, recounting the trials and triumphs of Rick Allen and Steve Clark. The July 18 broadcast still produced some of the channel's highest-ever ratings and is available on DVD.\n\nDef Leppard's tenth album, simply titled X, was released in July 2002. It saw the band's musical direction moving more towards pop and further away from the band's hard rock roots.\n\nAlthough greeted with generally positive reviews, X quickly disappeared from the charts, ultimately becoming the band's least successful release. However, the accompanying tour played to the band's strongest audiences since Adrenalize.\n\nAn expanded and updated best-of collection, Best Of, was released internationally in October 2004. The North America-only version, Rock Of Ages - The Definitive Collection, was released the following May. Def Leppard would participate at the Live 8 show in Philadelphia and toured in the summer with Bryan Adams. 2005 also saw the band leave their longtime management team, Q-Prime, and sign with HK Management.\n\nOn May 23, 2006, Def Leppard released an all-covers album titled Yeah!. The disc pays homage to classic rock songs of their childhood, originally recorded by ELO, Sweet, The Kinks, Blondie, and Badfinger among others. It debuted at #16 in the US, their tenth consecutive Top 20 album, and has scanned more than 140,000 copies to date.\n\nThe band, along with Queen, Kiss, and Judas Priest, were the inaugural inductees of \"VH1 Rock Honors\" on May 31, 2006. During the show, The All-American Rejects paid homage to the band with a cover of \"Photograph\". Soon afterwards, they embarked on a successful US tour with Journey. That October, Hysteria was re-released in a two-disc deluxe edition format, which combined the original album, remastered for the first time, with b-sides, remixes, and bonus tracks from single releases.\n\nDef Leppard began their \"Downstage Thrust Tour\", on June 29, which took them across the US and into Canada. Support bands were Foreigner and Styx.\n\nThe band's new album, entitled Songs from the Sparkle Lounge, was released worldwide on April 28, 2008 and on April 30, 2008 in Japan. The album debuted at #5 on The Billboard 200 in America. The first single is entitled \"Nine Lives\" and features country singer Tim McGraw, who co-wrote the song with Joe Elliott, Phil Collen, and Rick Savage.\n\nA tour in support of the album began on March 27, 2008 in Greensboro, NC,[7] with Styx and REO Speedwagon joining the band on US dates. The band also played several European rock festivals. An arena tour of the UK took place in June in which the band co-headlined with Whitesnake and it was supported by US southern rockers Black Stone Cherry. The band then returned to Europe before coming back for a second leg of the UK tour in June. The first of these dates was at the Glasgow SECC on the 17th.\n\nAgain they were be joined by Whitesnake; however hard rock band Thunder supported at some of these shows. Black Stone Cherry continued to support most of the dates, including some of the Thunder ones. The band announced that due to an upper respiratory tract infection affecting lead singer, Joe Elliott, they postponed the Canadian dates. Two more American shows were also cancelled due to a viral infection affecting Phil Collen.\n\nDef Leppard announced that the 6 shows that were cancelled during their USA/Canada leg of their world tour due to illnesses affecting Joe Elliott and Phil Collen would be rescheduled and played in August this year along with other locations.\n\nOn June 11th, Def Leppard announced further dates for their 2008 World Tour. The extension will see them visit India, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Whitesnake will continue to support Def Leppard for their Indian and Japanese dates. Australian tour dates will feature Cheap Trick as support and local Australian, Melbourne based band The Galvatrons as second support. The AUS/NZ dates include 8 dates seeing them visit major capital cities as well as a few unlikely ones. Def Leppard, Cheap Trick and The Galvatrons will visit Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Newcastle, Brisbane, Wollongong and Canberra. Def Leppard are supported by The Galvatrons and Auckland band Jealous Itch in Auckland (NZ).\n\nOn October 6, 2008 Def Leppard again were in Nashville, Tennessee, for the filming of CMT Crossroads with rising country star Taylor Swift. The pair switched playing and singing each other's songs in front of a small audience at the Acuff Theatre.\n\nDef Leppard is currently touring 41 US cities plus Toronto, Ontario, Canada during Summer 2009 with Poison and Cheap Trick[8], although similar in nature to the dual headline concept of Def Leppard/Whitesnake, Def Leppard/Journey and Def Leppard/Bryan Adams tours, on this tour, Def Leppard is the sole headliner (with Cheap Trick installed as the opening act, and Poison in the second slot).\n\nOn Sunday 14th June 2009 Def Leppard headlined Download Festival 2009, with Whitesnake and ZZ Top supporting them. During their performance Joe Elliott dedicated their entire show to Drummer Rick Allen, and they had told the audience that their appearance at Donington Park's Monsters Of Rock Festival in 1986 was Rick's first major show since he lost his arm and that day marked Def Leppard's re-birth as a result of the support they received from their audience. Their subsequent return to Donington Park for 2009's Download Festival marked a return to where the band had considered their spiritual home. What followed was yet another emotionally charged ovation from the 80,000 strong crowd as they threw their support for Rick Allen, lasting well over 5 minutes of their headlining performance.\n\nOn June 16, Def Leppard performed on the CMT Music Awards with Taylor Swift. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Def+Leppard\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Ironstone/SUBDance: In 2014 Ironstone was accepted to the Juilliard School where he devoted himself to his dance training and the exploration of his art. It was at Juilliard that Ironstone discovered he believes consummately in the artist&#39;s role to become fully consumed in emotion and reflection, such that we learn more about ourselves, and the dynamics we share universally. Hungry for more knowledge, Ironstone decided to continue his education by pursuing a degree in Global Studies. Ironstone enjoys the process of invention and the craft involved in carving out clear articulations of thoughts and emotions processed through movement. His vision is to continue a legacy for young artists to bridge the gap between social and political justice through art. After completing a study abroad trip in Guatemala and Belize studying Anthropology and Botany, Ironstone is most inspired at the moment with counter-instructions in our own centrality. Freedom without responsibility is chaos.

A former member of the rock band Stomp on Melvin, Stirling began releasing videos on Youtube in 2007 and in 2010 competed on \"America's Got Talent\". Her appearance on \"America's Got Talent\" gained the attention of cinematographer Devin Graham, with whom she has collaborated on several videos since 2010. Her YouTube channel has become extremely popular and has received upwards of 100 million views.\n\nStirling was born in Santa Ana, California, but spent a portion of her childhood in Gilbert, Arizona and graduated from Mesquite High School. She moved to Provo, Utah to attend Brigham Young University to study recreational therapy. She went on to perform missionary work in New York City for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Stirling returned home to Provo in 2009 to continue studying at BYU. She resided there until December 2012, when she moved back to Arizona with her family. Currently she lives in Los Angeles, California.\n\nAt the age of five, after being influenced by the classical music records played by her father, Stirling began to study the violin. She took private lessons for twelve years. When she was sixteen, she joined a rock band in Mesquite High School with four friends called \"Stomp on Melvin\". As part of her experience with Stomp on Melvin, Stirling wrote a solo violin rock song, and her performance helped her to win the state title of Arizona's Junior Miss and claim the Spirit Award in the America's Junior Miss Finals competition. Stirling was also a member of Charley Jenkins Band for about a year.\n\nStirling has released one EP, \"Lindsey Stomp\" in 2010, along with several singles, including collaborations with Peter Hollens, Eppic and Megan Nicole. Her debut full-length self-titled album \"Lindsey Stirling\" was released 18th September 2012. In December 2012, YouTube announced that Stirling's song, \"Crystallize\", was the No. 8 top-viewed video of 2012 with over 42 million views.\n\nOn March 12, 2014, Stirling posted a video announcing her second studio album, Shatter Me, would be released in May. She also created a PledgeMusic account where consumers could buy her new album, signed or not, and also exclusive items, such as signed posters, personalized video and even Skype calls with Stirling herself. At the end of the first day, the signed Shatter Me CD was already sold out. On March 25, 2014, Stirling officially released her first single from Shatter Me, entitled \"Beyond the Veil\", along with its accompanying music video. Their second album Shatter Me was released on April 29, 2014. It is Stirling's first album to include collaborations with other vocalists, featuring Lzzy Hale (from Halestorm) and Dia Frampton, and Stirling has said its musical style is more progressive than her first album. During its pre-sale, the album peaked at number one on the US iTunes electronic charts. On its released in USA the album reached the second position on Billboard 200, making Stirling's biggest sales week of her career. The album peaked on four different Billboard music charts.\n\nOfficial website: www.lindseystirling.com\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lindsey+Stirling\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They first came to fame with a 1997 limited single release, At the River (made famous after being used in various Marks & Spencer advertisements), which sampled \"Old Cape Cod\" by Patti Page. The song has since made its way onto numerous chill-out compilations.\n\nTheir most famous work is the 2000 international hit I See You Baby, remixed by Fatboy Slim in the Big Beat style -- with the repeated chorus line \"Shakin' that ass,\" as heard in Renault M\u00e9gane advertisements. Vocals were provided by Ibiza-based DJ Gram'Ma Funk. Incidentally, this track was also recorded with the chorus line \"Shakin' that thang\" as a radio edit. While this is their most famous work, they have also produced less mainstream songs which are often featured in television adverts.\n\nIn the early part-of 2008 after parting company with Sony BMG, Groove Armada signed an \"all encompassing deal\" with the Bacardi rum brand that allows them to use GA's tracks for adverts.  For more information, read Bands turn to brands in new deals\n\n    * Groove Armada's Suntoucher was sampled by Jay-Z for the song \"What More Can I Say\" on his Black Album.\n\n    * The track Hands of Time is featured in the movie Collateral, and is referred to by one of the characters as a \"classic song.\" It is also featured in the television series Cold Case; it was played as the ending song in the episode entitled Street Money, from the show's sixth season.\n\n    * Groove Armada's debut album was Northern Star, released in 1998.\n\n    * In 1999, Groove Armada released Vertigo, which had a more polished, mainstream sound. This album includes \"At The River,\" which was re-released as a single (#23 UK).\n\n    * In 2001, Goodbye Country, Hello Nightclub was released, with the title suggesting their new album was more upbeat and less geared toward chilling out -- as demonstrated by the single \"Superstylin'\" (#5 UK).\n\n    * In 2002, they released the DJ mix album Another Late Night: Groove Armada, part of the Another Late Night series on Azuli Records.\n\n    * In 2002, less than a year after Goodbye Country, Hello Nightclub, Groove Armada produced Lovebox, which incorporated a variety of genres. Some tracks, such as \"Madder,\" featured a rock element, while others, such as \"Lovebox\" and \"Remember,\" were closer to traditional house. \"Remember\" has vocals made up entirely of samples of Sandy Denny singing at Fairport.\n\n    * In 2004, Groove Armada released a best-of album, which included hits and new productions (#6 UK).\n\n    * In May 2007 Soundboy Rock was released, featuring the track Get Down. Guest appearances include M.A.D., Red Rat and Mutya Buena (see: Sugababes). The album was released on CD, Vinyl, and also as a limited CD package with 2 bonus tracks.\n\n * In March 2010 Black Light, their 6th studio album, was released.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groove_Armada <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Groove+Armada\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A native of EL Paso, TX, Evans\u00a0was exposed to classical, gospel and pre-rock pop as a child and studied classical piano for 12 years while growing up. It wasn\u2019t until late adolescence that she seriously got into jazz and R&B. Evans\u00a0has cited Sarah Vaughn, Carmen McRae, Nina Simone, Ella Fitzgerald, June Christie and Ethel Waters\u00a0as some of her main influences, and she has also expressed great admiration for such R&B favorites as Ruth Brown, Roberta Flack, Gladys Knight\u00a0and Patti LaBelle.\u00a0In fact, both gospel and the soul music of the 1960s and 1970s have had an impact on her full-bodied style of jazz singing. One of Evans\u2019\u00a0strong points has been her wild sense of humor \u2014 in fact, she can be downright goofy at times. But as much clowning as Evans\u00a0has done on stage and in the studio, she can also be a very moving, sensitive and poignant interpreter of lyrics. Though primarily a vocalist, Evans\u00a0is also an appealing, melodic pianist and has named Bill Evans, Dorothy Donegan, Erroll Garner and George Shearing\u00a0as influences. CDs that Evans\u00a0has released on her own Note-Worthy label include For Jaz C Me (1990), In A Sentimental Mood\u00a0(1994) and the gospel-oriented The Gospel According To\u2026Yve\u00a0(1995).

Bill Evans (born William John Evans; 16th August 1929-15th September 1980) was one of the most famous jazz pianists of the twentieth century. Along with McCoy Tyner and Oscar Peterson, he was the force behind the biggest evolution in jazz piano since Art Tatum and Bud Powell. \n\nHis use of impressionistic harmony, his inventive interpretation of traditional jazz repertoire, and his syncopated and polyrhythmic melodic lines influenced a generation of pianists, including Herbie Hancock, Denny Zeitlin, Chick Corea, and Keith Jarrett, and his work continues to inspire younger pianists such as Fred Hersch, Bill Charlap, and Lyle Mays, as well as other musicians such as guitarist John McLaughlin.\n\nHe worked briefly with Miles Davis and was the pianist on all but one track of Kind of Blue (1959).  In fact, although \"Blue in Green\" is credited to Davis, Evans always claimed that it was his own composition and that some years later Davis gave him $25 as compensation for lost royalties.\n\nEvans won seven Grammys during his career, the first for Conversations with Myself (1963) although not for his most celebrated work, Sunday at The Village Vanguard (1961) with bassist Scott LaFaro and drummer Paul Motian.\n\nIn 1994, Bill Evans was posthumously awarded a \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) \"for altering the course of jazz piano with his lyrical, impressionistic solo and trio recordings, characterised by the understated intensity, distinctive chord voicings, and unique harmonic sensibility that opened up the vocabulary of modern jazz\".\n\n\n2.) Bill Evans (born 9th February 1958 in Clarendon Hills, Illinois, USA) is an American jazz saxophonist. His father was a classical piano prodigy and until junior high school Evans studied classical clarinet. Early in his studies he was able to hear such artists as Sonny Stitt and Stan Getz live at the Jazz Showcase in Chicago. He attended Hinsdale Central High School and studied with jazz tenor saxophonist Vince Micko.\n\nHe plays primarily tenor and soprano saxophones. Evans attended North Texas State University and William Paterson University, where he studied with Dave Liebman, who had played with Miles Davis. Moving to New York City in 1979 he spent countless hours in lofts playing jazz standards and perfecting his improvisational style. At the age of twenty-two he joined Miles Davis. In the early to mid-1980s, Evans played with Davis and was instrumental in his musical comeback. Notable albums recorded with Miles include The Man with the Horn, We Want Miles, and Decoy. \n\nIn addition to playing with Miles Davis he has played, toured and recorded with artists such as Herbie Hancock, John Mclaughlin (and his Mahavishnu Orchestra), Michael Franks, Willie Nelson, Mick Jagger, Les McCann, Mark Egan, Danny Gottlieb, Ian Anderson, and Randy Brecker, among others. He is featured on the Petite Blonde album with Victor Bailey, Dennis Chambers, Mitch Forman, and Chuck Loeb. \n\nTwo of his most recent albums Soul Insider and Soulgrass were nominated for Grammy awards. Soulgrass was a groundbreaking bluegrass-jazz fusion concept involving such musicians as B\u00e9la Fleck, Sam Bush, Bruce Hornsby, and Vinnie Colaiuta. Although his latest projects are musically eclectic, his stylistic roots remain in the history of jazz saxophone, influenced by such players as Sonny Rollins, Joe Henderson, Sonny Stitt, John Coltrane, Hank Mobley, Stan Getz, and Steve Grossman.\n\n\n3.) San Francisco Bay Area musician and Virginia native Bill Evans has been involved with bluegrass music and the banjo for over twenty-five years as a player, teacher, writer, and historian. He occupies a unique niche in the banjo world: celebrated worldwide for his traditional and progressive bluegrass banjo styles as well as his innovative original compositions, he also enjoys a reputation as an outstanding instructor as well as being an expert player of nineteenth-century minstrel and classic/parlour banjo styles. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Evans\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song appears originally on The Band's first album, Music from Big Pink.\n\n\"The Weight\" is one of the group's best known songs and among the most popular songs of the late 1960s counterculture. However, the song was not a significant mainstream hit for The Band in the US, peaking at only #63. The Band's record fared much better in Canada and the UK \u2013 in those countries, the single was a top 40 hit, peaking at #35 in Canada and #21 in the UK in 1968. No fewer than three cover versions of \"The Weight\" actually charted higher on the US pop charts in 1968/69 than The Band's original recording:\n\n1968: Jackie DeShannon took the song to #55 US, #35 Canada.1969: A joint effort by Diana Ross & The Supremes and The Temptations hit #46 US, #36 Canada.1969: Aretha Franklin's version was the highest charting recording of \"The Weight\" in both the US and Canada, peaking at #19 US, #12 Canada.\n\nNone of these cover versions charted in the UK, where The Band's version of \"The Weight\" remains the only version to chart.\n\nThe song is #41 in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, published in 2004.[1] On the original single issue, the artist credit simply lists the names of the five members of The Band; the group name \"The Band\" does not appear.\nSong theme\n\n\"The Weight\" takes the folk music motif of a traveler, who in the first line arrives in Nazareth in the Lehigh Valley region of Pennsylvania. Once there, he encounters various residents of the town, the song being a story of these encounters. Nazareth is the hometown of the guitar manufacturer C. F. Martin & Company. Years later, the band Nazareth took its name from this line. The Biblical Nazareth was the childhood home of Jesus.\n\nThe residents include a man who cannot direct the traveler to a hotel, Carmen and the Devil walking side by side, \"Crazy Chester,\" who offers a bed in exchange for the traveler taking his dog, and Luke who has gone out to wait for the apocalypse, leaving his young bride neglected.\n\nIn Levon Helm's autobiography \"This Wheel's on Fire,\" Helm explains that the people mentioned in the song were based on real people the Band knew. The \"Miss Anna Lee\" mentioned in the lyric is Helm's longtime friend Anna Lee Amsden.\n\nRobertson on \"The Weight\"\n\nAccording to songwriter Robertson, \"The Weight\" was inspired by the films of Luis Bu\u00f1uel, about which Robertson once said:\n(Bu\u00f1uel) did so many films on the impossibility of sainthood. People trying to be good in Viridiana and Nazarin, people trying to do their thing. In \u2018The Weight\u2019 it\u2019s the same thing. People like Bu\u00f1uel would make films that had these religious connotations to them but it wasn\u2019t necessarily a religious meaning. In Bu\u00f1uel there were these people trying to be good and it\u2019s impossible to be good. In \"The Weight\" it was this very simple thing. Someone says, \"Listen, would you do me this favour? When you get there will you say 'hello' to somebody or will you give somebody this or will you pick up one of these for me? Oh? You\u2019re going to Nazareth, that\u2019s where the Martin guitar factory is. Do me a favour when you\u2019re there.\" This is what it\u2019s all about. So the guy goes and one thing leads to another and it\u2019s like \"Holy Shit, what\u2019s this turned into? I\u2019ve only come here to say 'hello' for somebody and I\u2019ve got myself in this incredible predicament.\" It was very Bu\u00f1uelish to me at the time.\nOnly in this case, the traveler encounters the favor-asking people in Nazareth itself. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Band/_/The+Weight\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Confederate soldier Virgil Caine \"served on the Danville train,\" the main supply line into the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia is holding the line at the Siege of Petersburg. As part of the offensive campaign, Union Army General George Stoneman's forces \"tore up the track again\". The siege lasted from June 1864 to April 1865, when both Petersburg and Richmond fell, and Lee's troops were starving at the end (\"We were hungry / Just barely alive\"). Virgil relates and mourns the loss of his brother: \"He was just eighteen, proud and brave / But a Yankee laid him in his grave.\"\n\nRalph J. Gleason (in the review in Rolling Stone (US edition only) of October 1969) explains why this song has such an impact on listeners: \"Nothing I have read \u2026 has brought home the overwhelming human sense of history that this song does. The only thing I can relate it to at all is 'The Red Badge of Courage'. It's a remarkable song, the rhythmic structure, the voice of Levon and the bass line with the drum accents and then the heavy close harmony of Levon, Richard and Rick in the theme, make it seem impossible that this isn't some traditional material handed down from father to son straight from that winter of 1865 to today. It has that ring of truth and the whole aura of authenticity.\"\n\nRobertson claimed that he had the music to the song in his head but had no idea what it was to be about. \"At some point [the concept] blurted out to me. Then I went and I did some research and I wrote the lyrics to the song.\" Robertson continued, \"When I first went down South, I remember that a quite common expression would be, 'Well don't worry, the South's gonna rise again.' At one point when I heard it I thought it was kind of a funny statement and then I heard it another time and I was really touched by it. I thought, 'God, because I keep hearing this, there's pain here, there is a sadness here.' In Americana land, it's a kind of a beautiful sadness.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Band/_/The+Night+They+Drove+Old+Dixie+Down\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In the song a man is convicted for murdering his best friend. He had an alibi but couldn't produce it in court: while the killing took place the widow shared his bed. Story told from the perspective of the executed in his own grave, visited by his loved one in mourning. This song revitalised Lefty's career. With Marijohn Wilkin on piano. This song is much younger than it looks. \n\ncovers: Country Gentlemen (1959) , Carl Mann (1960) , Joan Baez (1960) , Marijohn Wilkin (1961) own answer version as My Long Black Veil with slightly different lyrics: 'The few at the scene were wrong as can be, cause the man they accused that night was with me', Johnny Rivers (1962) , Johnny Cash (1965) , Bobby Bare (1966) , Marianne Faithfull (1967) , Band (1968) , Marsha Hunt (1969) , New Riders Of The Purple Sage (1972) , Sammi Smith (1974) , Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds (1986) , Proclaimers (1990) , Don Walser (1995) , Chieftains with Mick Jagger (1995) , Rick Danko (1997) almost 7 minute version, Dave Matthews Band (1999) , Harry Manx (2003) , \n\n> Frizzell was a Grand Ole' Opry star and an ex prize fighter with a fearsome left hand, hence his nickname Lefty.

Alternative Press and Revolver have sung their praises, Modern Drummer has featured Luke for his work in the band and mega-popular YouTube covers, Guitar World has spotlighted the interplay between Tony and Zack and their twin attack, and the band has graced the cover of Outburn Magazine. 2014 saw the band&#39;s latest release &#39;REAL.&#39; land at #4 on the Billboard Top Hard Rock Albums Chart and #33 on the Billboard Top 200.

Formed in 1983 by the Frazier brothers, the band has evolved from playing the streets of the French Quarter to playing festivals and stages all over the world. While committed to upholding the tradition of brass bands, they have also extended themselves into the realms of funk and hip-hop to create their signature sound. \u201cRebirth can be precise whenever it wants to,\u201d says The New York Times, \u201cbut it\u2019s more like a party than a machine. It\u2019s a working model of the New Orleans musical ethos: as long as everybody knows what they\u2019re doing, anyone can cut loose.\u201d In the wake of the sometimes-stringent competition among New Orleans brass bands, Rebirth is the undisputed leader of the pack, and they show no signs of slowing down.Following the Grammy-winning Rebirth of New Orleans, Rebirth Brass Band is at it again with Move Your Body, an infectious, groove-laden collection of hip-shakers sure to saturate the dance floor. Rollicking originals like &quot;Who&#39;s Rockin, Who&#39;s Rollin&#39;&quot;? and &quot;Take &#39;Em to the Moon&quot; reaffirm the band&#39;s position as head of the brass throne while the rasta-esque &quot;On My Way&quot; and leave-nothing-to-the-imagination lyrics of &quot;HBNS&quot; showcase the unit&#39;s talent for penning unabashed party starters. Boasting a mastery of Rebirth&#39;s signature &quot;heavy funk&quot; sound, Move Your Body pushes and swings, leaving behind an 11 track thumbprint, approved by the Frazier brothers themselves, of a sultry Tuesday night spent dancing on their home court at the Maple Leaf Bar in New Orleans.</em></p>", "img": null, "title": "Rebirth Brass Band", "url": "http://austin.eventful.com/events/rebirth-brass-band-/E0-001-109806178-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "The Mohawk", "city": "Austin"}, {"date": "2018-01-16 00:00:00", "description": " <p><a href=\"https://mapleleafbar.com/artists/rebirth-brass-band/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rebirth Brass Band</a> plays the Maple Leaf every Tuesday.

The Band included Robbie Robertson (guitar, piano, drums, harmonica); Richard Manuel (1943-1986) (piano, harmonica, drums, saxophone, organ, slide guitar); Garth Hudson (organ, piano, clavinet, accordion, synthesizer, saxophone); Rick Danko (1943-1999) (bass guitar, violin, trombone, guitar), and Levon Helm (1940-2012) (drums, mandolin, guitar, bass guitar, harmonica).\n\nThe members of The Band first worked together as The Hawks, the backing band of rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins from 1959 until 1963. Afterwards, Bob Dylan recruited the quintet for his history-making 1965/1966 world tour and they joined him on the informal recordings that became the acclaimed Basement Tapes.\n\nDubbed \"The Band\" by their peers, the group left the comfort of their communal home in Saugerties, NY to begin recording as a group unto themselves. The Band recorded two of the most important albums of the late 1960s: their 1968 debut Music from Big Pink (featuring the hit single \"The Weight\") and 1969's The Band. These critically praised albums helped conceive country rock as something more than a genre, but rather as a celebration of \"Americana.\" As such, throughout their career they would repopularize traditional American musical forms during the psychedelic era. The Band dissolved in 1976; Martin Scorcese's landmark concert film \"The Last Waltz\" documented their final performance.  They reformed in 1983 without founding guitarist and main songwriter Robbie Robertson.\n\nAlthough always more popular with music journalists and fellow musicians than the general public, The Band has remained an admired and influential group. They have been inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nTheir music fused many elements: primarily old country music and early rock and roll, though the rhythm section often had a bouncy, funky punch reminiscent of Stax or Motown, and Robertson cites Curtis Mayfield and the Staple Singers as major influences. At its best, however, The Band's music was an organic synthesis of many musical genres which became more than the sum of its parts. The group's songwriting was also remarkable as, unlike much earlier rock and roll, and following upon the example set previously by The Byrds, very few of their early compositions were based on conventional blues and doo-wop chord changes.\n\nThe Band comprised Robbie Robertson (guitar); Richard Manuel (piano, harmonica, drums, saxophone); Garth Hudson (organ, piano, clavinet, accordion, synthesizer, saxophone); Rick Danko (bass guitar, violin, trombone); and Levon Helm (drums, mandolin, guitar, bass guitar) Excepting Robertson, all were multi-instrumentalists; each person's primary instrument is listed first. There was little instrument-switching when they played live, but when recording, the musicians could offer all manner of subtle aural colors and textures to enhance songs. Hudson in particular was able to coax an impressive range of timbres from his Lowrey electronic organ; on the choruses of \"Tears of Rage\", for example, it sounds startlingly like a mellotron. Helm's drumming was rarely flashy, but he was often praised for his subtlety and funkiness. Critic Jon Carroll famously declared that Helm was \"the only drummer who can make you cry,\" while prolific session drummer Jim Keltner admits to appropriating several of Helm's techniques.\n\nSingers Manuel, Danko, and Helm each brought a distinctive voice to The Band: Helm's gritty, southern voice had more than a hint of country, Danko sang in a soaring, unfettered tenor, and Manuel alternated between fragile falsetto and a wounded baritone. The singers regularly blended in unorthodox, but uncommonly effective harmonies. Though the singing was more or less evenly shared between the three men, both Danko and Helm have stated that they saw Manuel as the Band's \"lead\" singer.\n\nRobertson was the unit's chief songwriter (though he sang lead vocals on only three or four songs in The Band's career). This role, and Robertson's resulting claim to the copyright of most of the compositions, would become a point of much antipathy between the group's members, especially between Robertson and Helm.\n\nProducer John Simon is cited as a \"sixth member\" of The Band for producing and playing on Music from Big Pink, co-producing and playing on The Band, and playing on other songs up through The Band's 1993 reunion album Jericho.\n\nOn 10 December 1999 is when Rick Danko died in his sleep at age 56. He had been a long-time drug user. In 1997 he had been found guilty of trying to smuggle heroin into Japan. He told the presiding judge that he had begun using the drug (together with prescription morphine) to fight life-long pain resulting from a 1968 auto accident. No drugs were found in his system at the time of his death. Following the death of Rick Danko, The Band broke up for good.\n\nLevon Helm died on 19 April 2012 from complications of throat cancer.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Band\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Chet Atkins played rhythm guitar. You can hear Bill Black's stand-up bass, Scotty Moore's electric guitar, D.J. Fontana's drums and Floyd Cramer's piano. Recorded in January 1956 in Nashville, it was released as a single in the USA (with the B-side \"I Was the One\") on January 27, 1956. Despite RCA's early objections to the sound quality, one of the early Nashville takes won out, and \"Heartbreak Hotel\" became the best selling single of 1956, as well as the song with which Elvis is most identified. An English teacher from Bardwell Texas got the idea for the song after a suicide victim left a note, later published in a newspaper, with the phrase, \"I walk a lonely street.\" Mae Axton toyed with the idea, teeming up with Tom Durden and going so far to get Glenn Reeves to record a demo for Elvis to hear.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley/_/Heartbreak+Hotel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In 2004, it was listed #197 in Rolling Stone's list of 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The song is currently ranked as the 92nd greatest song of all time, as well as the fifth best song of 1956, by Acclaimed Music.[2][edit] \n\nRecording\n\"Don't Be Cruel\" was the first song that Presley's song publishers, Hill and Range, brought to him to record.[3] Blackwell was more than happy to give up 50% of the royalties and a co-writing credit to Presley to ensure that the \"hottest new singer around covered it\".[1]\n\nPresley recorded the song on July 2, 1956 during an exhaustive recording session at RCA studios in New York City.[1] During this session he also recorded \"Hound Dog\", and \"Any Way You Want Me\".[3] The song featured Presley's regular band of Scotty Moore on lead guitar (with Presley usually providing rhythm guitar), Bill Black on bass, D.J. Fontana on drums, and backing vocals from the Jordanaires. The producing credit was given to RCA's Steve Sholes, although the studio recordings reveal that Presley produced the songs in this session by selecting the song, reworking the arrangement on piano, and insisting on 28 takes before he was satisfied with it.[1] He also ran through 31 takes of \"Hound Dog\".[3]\n\n[edit] Release\nThe single was released on July 13, 1956 backed with \"Hound Dog\".[1] Within a few weeks \"Hound Dog\" had risen to #2 on the Pop charts with sales of over one million.[3] Soon after it was overtaken by \"Don't Be Cruel\" which took #1 on all three main charts; Pop, Country, and R 'n' B.[1] Between them, both songs remained at #1 on the Pop chart for a run of 11 weeks tying it with the 1950 Anton Karas hit The Third Man Theme and the 1951/1952 Johnnie Ray hit Cry for the longest stay at number one by a single record until 1992's smash \"End of the Road\" by Boyz II Men. By the end of 1956 it had sold in excess of four million copies.[1][3]\n\nPresley performed \"Don't Be Cruel\" during all three of his appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show in September 1956 and January 1957.[1]\n\n[edit] Legacy\n\"Don't Be Cruel\" went on to become Presley's biggest selling single recorded in 1956, with sales over six million by 1961.[1] It became a regular feature of his live sets until his death in 1977, and was often coupled with Jailhouse Rock or Teddy Bear during performances from 1969.[1]\n\nMany artists including Billy Swan, Cheap Trick, The Judds, Merle Haggard, John Lennon, Jerry Lee Lewis, Neil Diamond, and Jackie Wilson have recorded the song. Presley was said to be so impressed with Wilson's version that he would later incorporate many of Wilson's mannerisms into future performances.[1]\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley/_/Don%27t+Be+Cruel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

We recorded this song for at least seven or eight takes. At one point, I finally pushed the talkback button and said, 'EP, we can just do the ending. I can splice it on without doing the song all the way through again'. He answered me with, 'Bill, I'm gonna do it all the way through, or I'm not gonna do it at all!' So, we did it again.

Allmusic lists over 300 recorded releases of the song in versions by dozens of performers. At the 25th Grammy Awards held in 1983, the songwriters won Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Best Country Song; in addition, Willie Nelson's recording won for Best Male Country Vocal Performance.\n\nElvis Presley recorded his version of \"Always on My Mind\" on March 29, 1972. The song was released as the B-side of the Separate Ways single, which reached Gold status in the U.S for sales of over half a million copies. It was listed as a double sided hit reaching number 16 on Billboard magazine's Hot Country Singles chart in November 1972. In the UK \"Always on My Mind\" was the hit song and \"Separate Ways\" was the B-side. Brenda Lee's version had stalled at #45 on the country charts in 1972.\n\nOver thirty years later, Presley's version was played at the 2006 FIFA World Cup and included on that year's promotional compilation album Voices from the FIFA World Cup. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley/_/Always+On+My+Mind\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In truth, Elvis recorded \"My Happiness\" for his mom much earlier during his first visit to Sun Records, summer or early fall 1953. By the time Elvis recorded \"That's All Right,\" Jul. 5 1954, Sam Phillips was calling Elvis, hoping to find a vehicle for the voice that had haunted him off and on over several months. \"That's All Right,\" an Arthur \"Big Boy\" Cruddup song, was a favorite of Elvis's and wound up recorded on a whim. The irony is that Phillips had turned the tape deck off when Bill Black started smacking the stand-up bass and Elvis danced the moves that eventually made him the center of controversy on live television. Phillips told them to start again, this time with the tape recorder on. In the middel of July of '54, Dewey Phillips (no relation to Sam) played the disc dozens of times as calls poured into WHBQ in Memphis. Elvis, meanwhile, was at the Suzore #2 Movie Theater, which is where his parents found him and informed him that his record was a big hit on Dewey's radio show \"Red, Hot, and Blue.\" The song reached Number 4 in Memphis but did not chart nationally. Bassplayer Bill Black and guitarist Scotty Moore played along with Elvis, who played his own rhythm guitar. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley/_/That%27s+All+Right\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

This particular cut recorded in 1960 sold over two million copies and reached Number One on Billboard's charts, as well as achieving high positions on country and R&B charts. The performance of \"Stuck on You\" proved the high point of the evening in May 1960 as Elvis performed the tune with the Jordanaires on Frank Sinatra's \"Welcome Home\" Special celebrating Elvis's separation from the Army and his return to civilian life. The performance of this song is seen as one of Elvis's finest moments, as, in the first ten seconds, Elvis breaks new ground with dance moves not seen again until many years later, and filming him \"from the waist up\" is but a memory.

It has since become widely known and often performed by others.\nReleased as a double-sided single along with \"What'd I Say\" from the same film, \"Viva Las Vegas\" was a modest hit at best at the time, reaching number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop singles chart and number 17 on the UK Singles Chart, improving to number 15 after a reissue in 2007.\nHowever in years since, it has become one of Presley's most recognized numbers. In the 1990s and 2000s, the song has been contained in countless movies, TV sitcoms, either as a reference to the city of Las Vegas, or simply as an expression of joy, or bewilderement in related comedic situations. Somewhat amusingly, it is said that Doc Pomus wrote the words to \"Viva Las Vegas\" some thirty years before ever venturing west of Newark, New Jersey.\nIn 2002, the city of Las Vegas requested Elvis Presley Enterprises, the company that handles a portion of Elvis' legacy and all Elvis-related music rights, to allow it to be the official song of the city but negotiations were stalled over the price requested by EPE, notwithstanding that EPE had not controlled the copyright to the song \"Viva Las Vegas\" since 1993, at which time it became the property of the families of the songwriters Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman. That EPE no longer owns the copyright essentially means that EPE does not have the authority or right to negotiate the use of the song \"Viva Las Vegas\" in Las Vegas or anywhere else within the United States, its territories and possessions. Although, EPE may be able to negotiate the use of the actual Elvis recording of the song.\n\nAccording to the Viva Las Vegas Songfacts, this features Glen Campbell on guitar. Before he became a successful Country/Pop recording artist, Glen Campbell was much in demand as a session guitarist in the mid 1960s.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley/_/Viva+Las+Vegas\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A cultural icon, he is widely known by the single name Elvis. \n\nElvis Presley began his music career at Sun Records in the spring of 1954 when Sam Philips recorded Elvis performing several of Elvis' favorite songs with Scotty Moore (guitar) and Bill Black (bass).  One of these covers was a country and western song, \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\".\nElvis is the best-selling solo artist of all time in the United States with confirmed 189.2 million records in RIAA shipments.\n\nBefore Sam Philips sold Elvis' contract to RCA Victor in 1956 for $35,000 they had recorded six two-sided singles.  Each of these recordings featured a country and western song on one side and a rhythm and blues song on the other.  One of the reasons Elvis was so popular was because of his ability to merge attributes of what was perceived to be \"white\" (C&W) and \"black\" (R&B) music.  An example of this is evident in Elvis' hit song \"Heartbreak Hotel\" which reached #1 not only in the Pop charts, but the R&B and C&W charts as well.  This was the first time that a single song held the #1 spot in all three charts.  \n\nElvis remains a popular and enigmatic star. His legend has only grown stronger since his death. In fact, there is a widespread belief that Elvis\u2014who was known by his first name\u2014did not die in 1977. Many fans persist in claiming he is still alive, that he went into hiding for various reasons. This claim is allegedly backed up by thousands of so-called Elvis sightings that have occurred in the years since his death, and by the fact that his middle name Aron was misspelled Aaron, with two As, on his tombstone.\n\nDuring an active recording career that spanned more than two decades, Presley set and broke many records for both concert attendance and sales. Some of those records have since been matched and/or broken by other artists, but some of his records will probably remain unbroken and/or unmatched forever. He has had more than 120 singles in the US top 40, across various musical genres, with over 20 reaching number one.\n\nElvis Aaron (sometimes spelled Aron) Presley, in the humblest of circumstances, was born to Vernon and Gladys Presley in a two-room house in Tupelo, Mississippi on January 8, 1935. His twin brother, Jessie Garon, was stillborn, leaving Elvis to grow up as an only child. He and his parents moved to Memphis, Tennessee in 1948, and Elvis graduated from Humes High School there in 1953.\n\nBiography: Elvis' musical influences were the pop and country music of the time, the gospel music he heard in church and at the all-night gospel sings he frequently attended, and the black R&B he absorbed on historic Beale Street as a Memphis teenager. In 1954, he began his singing career with the legendary Sun Records label in Memphis. In late 1955, his recording contract was sold to RCA Victor. By 1956, he was an international sensation. With a sound and style that uniquely combined his diverse musical influences and blurred and challenged the social and racial barriers of the time, he ushered in a whole new era of American music and popular culture.\n\nHe starred in 33 successful films, made history with his television appearances and specials, and knew great acclaim through his many, often record-breaking, live concert performances on tour and in Las Vegas. Globally, he has sold over one billion records, more than any other artist. His American sales have earned him gold, platinum or multi-platinum awards for 150 different albums and singles, far more than any other artist. Among his many awards and accolades were 14 Grammy nominations (3 wins) from the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, which he received at age 36, and his being named One of the Ten Outstanding Young Men of the Nation for 1970 by the United States Jaycees. Without any of the special privileges his celebrity status might have afforded him, he honorably served his country in the U.S. Army.\n\nHis talent, good looks, sensuality, charisma, and good humor endeared him to millions, as did the humility and human kindness he demonstrated throughout his life. Known the world over by his first name, he is regarded as one of the most important figures of twentieth century popular culture. Health problems, drug dependency and other factors are said to have led to his premature death at age 42 at his Memphis home, Graceland, on August 16, 1977. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Presley\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

This song features characteristic \"Pixies dynamics\", in that it alternates between soft, quiet sections (in the verses) and loud, heavy sections (in the chorus). Kathleen Hanna, the lead singer of the group Bikini Kill, gave Cobain the idea for the title when she spray painted \"Kurt Smells Like Teen Spirit\" on his bedroom wall after a night of drinking and spraying graffiti around the Seattle area. In his pre-Courtney Love days, Cobain went out with Bikini Kill lead singer Tobi Vail, but she dumped him. Vail wore Teen Spirit deodorant, and Hanna was implying that Cobain was marked with her scent.Cobain didn't know it when he wrote the song, but Teen Spirit is a brand of deodorant marketed to young girls. Kurt thought Hanna was complimenting him on his rebellious spirit. Sales of Teen Spirit deodorant shot up when this became a hit, even though it is never mentioned in the lyrics.The video was inspired by the movie and song Rock And Roll High School by the Ramones. At the end of the video, when the band and the teenagers smash the set, it is real. The band and the teenagers had began getting mad after being on set for over 8 hours, and one of the teenagers asked if everyone could destroy the set. The producer said yes, so they destroyed it.The group hated the video, but everyone else loved it. The concept was \"Pep Rally from Hell.\" The cheerleaders were strippers. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/_/Smells+Like+Teen+Spirit\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is the third song on (and second single from) the band's second album Nevermind (1991). It was the album's second most successful single, and the band's second American Top 40 hit in 1992. After its release as a single in March 1992, \"Come as You Are\" peaked at number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100; it was the band's second and last American Top 40 hit. The single stayed on the chart for 18 weeks. The song also reached number three on the Billboard Mainstream and Modern Rock Tracks charts.\n\nIt was also one of the few new songs Nirvana recorded onto a rehearsal tape the group sent to producer Butch Vig prior to the recording of Nevermind in 1991. The group recorded the song with Vig during album sessions at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California, in early 1991. \"Come as You Are\" was selected as the second single from the album; it was anticipated that the album's first single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", would be a \"base-building alternative cut\", while \"Come as You Are\" would be able to cross over into other radio formats. However, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" became a surprise hit and boosted the band's popularity.\n\nThe song's prominent line \"And I swear that I don't have a gun\" has also been interpreted to mean that Cobain \"had nothing to hide from anyone.\" Cobain was known for writing using heavy metaphor in his lyrics, allowing fans to decide what the words meant to them. After the death of the song's author, the media paid much attention to the song's prominent line, and other songs on Nevermind that mentioned guns, though the album was written and recorded three years before Cobain's death and therefore it was taken as a mere coincidence.\n\nAccording to the Come As You Are Songfacts, the chords in this song are a slowed down replica of Killing Joke's 1985 song  Eighties. The songs were so similar that Nirvana considered holding off releasing this as a single. Killing Joke decided not to sue Nirvana, and in 2003, Dave Grohl helped them out by playing drums for them on an album. \n\nThe music video was directed by Kevin Kerslake, who later directed the videos for \"Lithium,\" \"In Bloom,\" and \"Sliver.\" The video features the band in a dark room, where the appearance of falling water in front of the band distorts and blurs the band members' faces (an idea suggested by Cobain). Throughout the video, clips such as cells multiplying at an incredible rate, to a living organism in its embryotic stages are shown. The video clip also features Kurt Cobain swinging away on a chandelier throughout the room, and water begins to flow into the room. In addition, the video shows parts involving a dog wearing a cone collar. Images of a baby swimming underwater (a reference to the cover of Nevermind) and a gun floating appear. Towards the end, a clip of the band appears, with Cobain in the front, lying on the ground and kissing the camera. The band shot outdoor footage in a park in Hollywood Hills a few days prior to the main video shoot. Kerslake projected this footage in the background of many shots in the main part of the video. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/_/Come+as+You+Are\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The name of the song is often attributed to the usage of lithium salts as mood stabilizers. Because of this the lyrics are often interpreted as describing bipolar disorder. Cobain is said to have had bipolar disorder, which may have led to the writing of the song \"Lithium\". Still, there is much disagreement about the exact meaning and interpretation of it.\n\nIn the Nevermind press kit, Cobain said this about the song: \"People who are secluded for so long go insane, and as a last resort they often use religion to keep alive. In the song, the guy's lost his girl and his friends and he's brooding. He's decided to find God before he kills himself. It's hard for me to understand the need for a vice like that, but I can appreciate it too. People need vices.\"\n\nBruce Lash did a mellow version that was used in the movie Marley & Me.

Written by frontman Kurt Cobain, the song addresses people outside of the underground music community who did not understand the band's message, and was also directed towards and written about the bands manager, \"He's the one, who likes all our pretty songs, and he likes to sing along, and he likes to shoot his gun, but he don't know what it means\".\n\nNirvana made its first music video for an early version of \"In Bloom\" in 1990, however the song did not appear on a commercial release until the release of the group's second album, Nevermind, in 1991. \"In Bloom\" became the fourth and final single from the album late in 1992. It was accompanied by a music video which parodied musical performances of 1960s variety shows.\n\nLike many Nirvana songs, \"In Bloom\" shifts back and forth between quiet verses to loud choruses. Cobain uses a Mesa Boogie guitar amplifier for the verses, and during the chorus he switches to a Fender Bassman amp (suggested by Vig) for a heavier, double-tracked fuzztone sound. The rhythm section of Novoselic and Grohl kept its parts simple; Grohl stated it was \"an unspoken rule\" to avoid unnecessary drum fills, while Novoselic said he felt his role was about \"serving the song\". During the choruses, vocalist Cobain and drummer Grohl harmonize while singing \"He's the one/Who likes all our pretty songs/And he likes to sing along/And he likes to shoot his gun/But he knows not what it means\". The song's intro reappears at the end of each chorus.\n\nCobain's lyrics address the people outside of the underground music scene that began showing up at Nirvana shows after the release of the group's debut album Bleach. Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad wrote, \"But remarkably, [the song's lyrics] translated even better to the mass popularity the band enjoyed.\" Regarding the song's chorus, Azerrad commented, \"The brilliant irony is that the tune is so catchy that millions of people actually do sing along to it.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/_/In+Bloom\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

(C) 1993 Geffen Records Best of Nirvana: https://goo.gl/phRJVc..."}, "description": "\"Heart-Shaped Box\" is a song by the American grunge band Nirvana, written by vocalist and guitarist Kurt Cobain released as the first single from the group's third studio album In Utero in 1993. It was one of two songs from the album mixed by Scott Litt in order to augment the original production by producer Steve Albini. While Nirvana's label DGC Records did not release a physical single for sale in the United States, \"Heart-Shaped Box\" received much American radio airplay, reaching number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The international release of the single reached number five in the United Kingdom.\n\nOrigin and recording\nKurt Cobain wrote \"Heart-Shaped Box\" in early 1992. Cobain forgot about the song for a while, but began working on it again when he and his wife Courtney Love moved to a house in the Hollywood Hills. In a 1994 Rolling Stone interview, Love said she overheard him working on the song's riff in a closet. She said she asked him if she could use the riff for one of her songs, to which he replied, \"Fuck off!\" and closed the closet door. \"He was trying to be so sneaky\", said Love. \"I could hear that one from downstairs.\" The couple shared a journal in which they would write lyrics; Cobain biographer noted that Love's songwriting sensibility informed Cobain's on the song. The song's name came from a heart-shaped box Love had given Cobain. However, Cobain had originally titled the song \"Heart-Shaped Coffin\".\n\nNirvana had difficulty completing the song. Cobain attempted to have the rest of the band complete the song during jam sessions. He said, \"During those practices, I was trying to wait for Chris and Dave to come up with something but it just turned into noise all the time.\" One day Cobain made one last attempt at completing the song. Cobain was able to come up with a vocal melody and the band finally finished writing the song. Cobain said that when they completed \"Heart-Shaped Box\", \"We finally realized that it was a good song.\"\n\nIn January 1993, the band recorded a demo of \"Heart-Shaped Box\" during sessions with Craig Montgomery in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; it was the first song recorded. The In Utero version was recorded in February 1993 by Steve Albini in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. It was remixed, along with \"All Apologies\" and later \"Pennyroyal Tea,\" by Scott Litt prior to the album's release. Cobain was unapologetic about the band's decision, and maintained that the vocals and bass were not prominent enough in the original mixes. Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic was also unhappy with the original mix of \"Heart-Shaped Box.\" In a 1993 Chicago Sun-Times interview, he said the original effect used on the song's guitar solo sounded \"like a fucking abortion hitting the floor.\" When the song was remixed by Scott Litt, Cobain took the opportunity to add acoustic guitar and backing harmonies.\n\nComposition and lyrics\nJournalist Gillian Gaar described \"Heart-Shaped Box\" as \"the Nirvana formula personified, with a restrained, descending riff played through the verse, building in intensity to the cascading passion of the chorus\".[1]\n\nCobain said the song was inspired by documentaries about children with cancer. He told biographer Michael Azerrad, \"Anytime I think about it, it makes me sadder than anything I can think of.\" Azerrad asserted in his biography of Nirvana, Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana, that despite Cobain's explanation, the song actually appeared to be about Courtney Love. Charles Cross wrote in his biography of Cobain Heavier Than Heaven that with the lyric \"I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black\", Cobain \"sang in what has to be the most convoluted route any songwriter undertook in pop history to say 'I love you'\". Cobain said that the song's chorus of \"Hey/Wait/I've got a new complaint\" was him giving an example of how he was perceived by the media.\n\nRelease\nIn the United States, DGC issued \"Heart-Shaped Box\" to college, modern rock, and album-oriented rock radio stations in early September 1993. There were no plans to release a single for the song domestically. At the time, Geffen Records' head of marketing told Billboard that the label was not actively courting Top 40 radio, explaining \"Nirvana didn't sell nearly 5 million [records] because of a hit single. They sold that many albums because of who they are.\" The song entered the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart at number seven, and eventually peaked at number one on the chart. The song also reached number four on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. A single of the song was released in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number on five on the UK Singles Chart. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/_/Heart-Shaped+Box\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In a 1993 Rolling Stone interview with David Fricke, he explained:\n\n    \"Even to put \"About a Girl\" on Bleach was a risk. I was heavily into pop, I really liked R.E.M., and I was into all kinds of old \u201860s stuff. But there was a lot of pressure within that social scene, the underground \u2014 like the kind of thing you get in high school. And to put a jangly R.E.M. type of pop song on a grunge record, in that scene, was risky.\" [2]\n\nHowever, Bleach producer Jack Endino was excited about the song, and even saw it as a potential single. Years later, Butch Vig, who produced Nirvana's 1991 breakthrough album Nevermind, would cite \"About a Girl\" as the first hint that there was more to Nirvana than grunge. \"Everyone talks about Kurt's love affair with... the whole punk scene, but he was also a huge Beatles fan, and the more time we spent together the more obvious their influence on his songwriting became,\" Vig told the NME in 2004.\n\n\"About a Girl\" was recorded for Bleach in December 1988 by Endino in Seattle, Washington. It remained one of the few songs from Bleach which Nirvana continued to perform live until Cobain's death in April 1994. A live acoustic rendition was recorded during the band's MTV Unplugged set on November 18, 1993 at Sony Music Studios in New York City. It was released on the band's posthumous MTV Unplugged in New York album in 1994 and was the only commercial single from that album.\n\nThe Bleach version was re-released on the band's 2002 \"best-of\" compilation album, Nirvana.

The song was released as the second single from Nirvana's 1993 album In Utero, packaged as a double a-side along with \"All Apologies.\"\n\n\"Rape Me\" was written by Nirvana singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain in an apartment in Los Angeles, California in May 1991, around the time the band's second album, Nevermind (1991), was being mixed. It was first performed live on June 18, 1991, at the Catalyst in Santa Cruz, California, and subsequently played several times at Nirvana concerts during the next two years. These early live versions featured a dissonant, semi-improvised \"anti-solo\" after the second chorus, which was replaced by a bridge in the song's final incarnation.\n\nThe band had wanted to debut it at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards in Los Angeles on September 9, but MTV insisted on them playing \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" instead. According to the Cobain biography Heavier Than Heaven, the network's reasoning was not so much due to the controversial usage of the word \"rape,\" but rather because they assumed Cobain was using the song to jab at the media (and MTV) for their abuse of his celebrity status. (Only weeks earlier, a Vanity Fair article depicting Cobain and his wife Courtney Love as unfit parents nearly resulted in the removal of their newborn child Frances Bean Cobain from their custody. MTV News was one of the media sources who reported this story.) Nirvana ultimately settled on playing their then-latest single \"Lithium.\" However, to show their disapproval of MTV's insistence, \"Lithium\" was preceded by the first 5 seconds of \"Rape Me.\" The opening chords and the song's title lyrics were sung twice, and MTV was seconds away from pulling their performance off the air and going to a commercial when the band abruptly stopped the song and went into the intro of \"Lithium.\"\n\nThe song was first recorded in the studio by Jack Endino in October 1992 in Seattle, Washington.\n\nThe studio version of \"Rape Me\" that appears on In Utero was recorded by Steve Albini in February 1993. In December of that year, it was released alongside \"All Apologies\" as the album's second single.

It is the sixth song on their 1991 album, Nevermind.\n\nDating back to at least 1988, \"Polly\" stands alongside \"About a Girl\" and \"Been a Son\" as one of singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain's earliest forays into unfiltered pop songwriting. It was originally titled \"Hitchhiker\", and later \"Cracker\", but was renamed to \"Polly\" some time in 1989. It was left off Nirvana's 1989 debut album Bleach because Cobain believed it was not consistent with the band's heavy grunge sound of the time. However, it found its way onto the band's second album Nevermind two years later, and remained a part of the band's regular setlist until Cobain's death (and Nirvana's dissolution) in April 1994. It also stands as Chad Channing's only contribution to the album, having left the band before the recording of Nevermind.\n\nThe song is about the horrific kidnapping of a 14 year old girl at gunpoint as she left a punk gig in Tacoma.  the abducor, Gerald Friend raped her repeatedly and tortured her with razors and a blowtorch in his mobile home.  The girl eventually escaped and Friend was imprisoned. Writing from the perspective of the abductor, Cobain manages to convey not just the repugnance of the ordeal, but also something of the abductor (\"she's just as bored as me\").   <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/_/Polly\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

There\u2019s no sense in trying to redeem yourself by putting out an abrasive album and pretending you\u2019re a punk rocker again\".

Cobain tended to dislike heavily overdubbed songs, and so Vig had to tell Cobain lies, such as that tracks did not record right or were out of tune, in order to get him to do so many takes. Some of the strange noises during the middle section of the song are caused by children's toys Cobain brought into the studio. In his biography of Kurt Cobain Heavier than Heaven, biographer Charles Cross wrote, \"When Kurt was questioned about the song [Drain You] he said he had made a lot of it up on the spot but that the first line...was particularly important to the interpretation of the song...\"\n\nOn the Nevermind version, Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic tuned their instruments a whole step down. In concert, however, \"Drain You\" was generally played in whatever tuning the band was using throughout the rest of the concert \u2014 generally standard tuning in earlier concerts (prior to the 1992 Pacific Rim tour in support of Nevermind) and half-step-down in later concerts. The song's verse is based around a conventional chord progression of four power chords B, D#, G#, C#, the riff (F#)- E -C# for the choruses, and a chorus ending of B, A, G#. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/_/Drain+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The original song's author is Leadbelly, his stage name, or Huddie William Ledbetter (January 1888 \u2013 December 6, 1949). A 1993 acoustic version by Nirvana introduced the song to many people at the end of the twentieth century. Kurt Cobain attributed authorship to Lead Belly, who had recorded the song several times, beginning in 1944, but the version performed by Lead Belly and covered by Nirvana does not differ substantially from other variants of the song. Most versions of this song are performed in 6/8 time.\n\nNirvana: \"Where Did You Sleep Last Night\" was occasionally performed live by the American rock band Nirvana during the early 1990s. Singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain was introduced to the song by Lanegan, and even played guitar on Lanegan's version. Like Lanegan, Cobain usually screamed the song's final verse. Cobain earned critical and commercial acclaim for his acoustic performance of the song during Nirvana's MTV Unplugged appearance in 1993. This version was posthumously released on the band's MTV Unplugged in New York album (and as a B-side on their recalled \"Pennyroyal Tea\" single) the following year. A solo Cobain home demo of the song, recorded in 1990, appears on the band's 2004 box set, With the Lights Out. It does not feature the final screamed verse of later versions. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/_/Where+Did+You+Sleep+Last+Night\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is the first song on their 2002 compilation album, Nirvana, and the last official single to be released by the band.\n\nThe song was recorded in January 1994, making it one of the few post-In Utero Kurt Cobain compositions known to exist. For years, it was known from only a bootlegged live version, recorded on October 23, 1993 at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago, Illinois, and from a performance of the song by Hole (fronted by Cobain's widow, Courtney Love), performed during the band's MTV Unplugged set in 1995. A studio version of the song had been recorded at Nirvana's final session, on January 30, 1994 at Robert Lang Studios in Seattle, Washington, but remained locked away from fans for years following Cobain's death.\n\nYou Know You're Right was eventually released as a promo single in October 2002, and a Chris Hafner-directed music video was made. The video used various footage of band performances pieced together to give the effect of the song actually being performed, including brief clips of Cobain singing. The song made No. 45 on the Billboard Hot 100 due to moderate airplay. The song charted at #1 on both the Billboard Mainstream and Modern Rock Tracks. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/_/You+Know+You%27re+Right\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Cobain was initially unimpressed with the riff, and admitted in the book that he only worked on it so that Grohl would not be offended. \"It was such a clich\u00e9 grunge Tad riff that I was reluctant to even jam on it,\" he said.\n\nHowever, all three members continued to work on the song, and its dynamics eventually fell into place. \"It was just a totally satisfying thing to finally contribute equally to a song,\" Cobain said in a 1993 Chicago Sun-Times interview, \"instead of me coming up with the basics of the song.\"\n\n\"Scentless Apprentice\" is based on the German novel Perfume, by Patrick S\u00fcskind. Published in 1985, the novel tells the story of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, a boy born without body odor but with a heightened sense of smell. Grenouille grows up to be a perfume apprentice, and uses perfume to mask his lack of odor. He also becomes a murderer, stealing the smells of his female victims in his quest to create a human odor for himself. \n\nIn a 1993 MuchMusic interview, Cobain claimed that his copy of Perfume almost never left his pocket.

Despite what many believe, this song has very little (arguably, nothing) to do with her so-called controversial essay \"God Dies\".\n\nFarmer was involuntarily institutionalised by her family a number of times for causing trouble and legal problems with Paramount Pictures, and what those close to her believed to be psychological problems.\n\nFew of her friends and family helped her, and most actively sought to hurt her. Given Cobain's personal experience of being abandoned as a kid, it's definitely not a surprise he could relate to this. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/_/Frances+Farmer+Will+Have+Her+Revenge+on+Seattle\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Following are six, listed in order of prominence:\n\n1) Nirvana was a popular and highly influential American grunge band. The band formed in Aberdeen, Washington in 1987, and it was part of the Seattle grunge scene of the late 80s, alongside bands like Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden. As their popularity rose, alternative rock became a dominant genre on American and Canadian radio and music television during the early-to-mid '90s.\n\nIn late 1987, Cobain and Novoselic recruited drummer Aaron Burckhard (1987\u20131988).The three practiced material from Cobain's Fecal Matter tape.  After losing contact with Burckhard, the pair instead practised with Dale Crover of the Melvins, and Nirvana recorded its first demos in January 1988. Their first single, a cover version of \"Love Buzz\", a song by Dutch group 'Shocking Blue', was released in November 1988 on the Seattle independent record label Sub Pop. Their debut album, 'Bleach', was produced by Jack Endino and released in June 1989. Later that year, the band recorded the 'Blew EP' with producer Steve Fisk.\n\nAt the start of the new decade, the band commenced their first recording sessions to the follow-up album with producer Butch Vig, substituted their drummer by Dave Grohl and signed to DGC Records. The result, 'Nevermind', would eventually sell over seven million copies in the United States, and over 30 million worldwide.\n\nIn early 1993, Nirvana released \"Puss\"/\"Oh, the Guilt\", a split single with The Jesus Lizard, on the independent label Touch & Go. Meanwhile, the group chose Steve Albini as the producer to record its third album. 'In Utero' debuted at number one on the Billboard album chart in September the same year. \n\nAs Nirvana's frontman, Cobain found himself referred to in the media as the \"spokesman of a generation\", with Nirvana the \"flagship band\" of \"Generation X\", their third studio album 'In Utero' was considered to be a conscious attempt to shed their audience. While Nirvana's mainstream popularity waned in the months following its release, their core audience cherished the band's dark interior, particularly after their 1993 performance on MTV Unplugged with the Meat Puppets, a band that Cobain had always idolised, performing with them the songs Oh, Me, Plateau and Lake of Fire. It was later released and topped the charts in 1994.\n\nNirvana's brief run ended with the suicide of Cobain in 1994, but the band's popularity expanded in the years that followed. Eight years after Cobain's death, \"You Know You're Right\", an unfinished demo that the band recorded two months prior to Cobain's death, topped radio playlists around the world. Since their debut, the band has sold more than fifty million albums worldwide, including more than ten million copies of Nevermind in the US alone. Nirvana remains a consistent presence on radio stations worldwide.\n\nIn 2004, the box set \"With the Lights Out\", a collection of radio sessions, home demos, studio demos and outtakes, was released. A year later, \"Sliver: The Best Of The Box\" was released, a compilation of selected \"WTLO\" tracks, but with 3 new tracks including a track from the famous \"Fecal Matter\" demo.\n\nBand members: Kurt Cobain - vocals, guitar (1987\u20131994), Krist Novoselic - bass (1987\u20131994) Dave Grohl - drums, vocals (1990\u20131994)\n\nPrior members:Aaron Burckhard - drums (1987\u20131988), Dale Crover - drums (1988, 1990),  Dave Foster - drums (1988), Chad Channing - drums (1988\u20131990), Jason Everman - guitar (1989), Dan Peters - drums (1990)\n\nTouring members: Pat Smear - guitar (1993\u20131994), Lori Goldston - cello (1993\u20131994), Melora Creager - cello (1994)\n\n---\n\n2) Nirvana is a UK-based progressive rock band formed in 1967, primarily active in the late 1960s and early 1970s - and still sporadically active to the present day.\n\nThe band was formed in the summer of 1967 in an era when melodic pop/rock music with baroque and chamber arrangements and instrumentation was highly-prized. The band, consisted of two songwriter/performers - Greek-born Alex Spyropoulos and Irish-born Patrick Campbell-Lyons who met in London. They produced a number of singles (notably \"Rainbow Chaser\", \"Pentecost Hotel\", and \"Tiny Goddess\") for the fledgling Island Records label.\n\nThe band was signed by Island Records' founder Chris Blackwell in the era when he also signed the bands Traffic and Free. \n\nIn October 1967 the band released its first album - a concept album produced by Blackwell titled The Story of Simon Simopath. The album was probably the first narrative concept album ever released - predating story-driven concept albums such as The Pretty Things' S.F. Sorrow (December 1968), The Who's Tommy (April 1969) and The Kinks' Arthur (September 1969).\n\nMusically, the group blended myriad musical styles including rock, pop, folk, jazz, Latin rhythms and classical music - primarily augmented by baroque chamber-style arrangements to create a unique entity.\n\nThe next year 1968 their follow-up album, All Of Us, featured a similar broad range of musical styles. Their third album To Markos III was released on the Pye label in 1969.\n\nIn 1971 the duo amicably separated for a while, with Campbell-Lyons the primary contributor to the next two Nirvana albums, Local Anaesthetic 1971, and Songs Of Love And Praise 1972. Campbell-Lyons subsequently worked as a solo artist and issued further albums: Me And My Friend 1973, Electric Plough 1981, and The Hero I Might Have Been 1983 though these did not enjoy commercial success.\n\nThe band reunited in 1985, successfully touring Europe and releasing a compilation album Black Flower 1987 containing some new material. (Black Flower had been the provisional title of their third album.) In the 1990s two further albums were released. Secret Theatre 1994 compiled rare tracks and demos, while Orange And Blue 1996 contained previously unreleased material including a tongue-in-cheek cover of the song \"Lithium\" originally recorded by the American grunge band Nirvana who released its first album in 1989, and who the band had successfully sued over use of the name Nirvana. The undisclosed terms of the settlement has apparently allowed the original Nirvana to continue using its name and issuing new recordings.\n\nIn 1999 the band released a three-disc CD anthology titled \"Chemistry\" including several previously-unreleased tracks and some new material.\n\nTop musicians who played on Nirvana sessions include: Lesley Duncan, Herbie Flowers, Billy Bremner (later of Rockpile/Dave Edmunds fame), Luther Grosvenor, Wynder K. Frogg, Clem Cattini and the full lineup of rock band Spooky Tooth.\n\nThe group was in the school of baroque-flavored, melodic pop-rock music typified by The Beatles of \"Rubber Soul\" and \"Revolver\", The Beach Boys of Pet Sounds and God Only Knows, the Zombies of Odessey and Oracle and Time Of The Season, the Procol Harum of A Whiter Shade Of Pale, the Moody Blues of Days of Future Passed and Nights In White Satin and The Kinks of Waterloo Sunset. The majority of the tracks on Nirvana's albums fall into that broad genre of contemporary popular music - not easily categorized - but perhaps best described as the baroque or chamber strand of \"progressive rock, soft rock or \"orchestral pop\".\n\nTheir first three albums were reissued on CD by Universal in 2003 and received critical acclaim. In 2005 Universal (Japan) reissued Local Anaesthetic and Songs Of Love And Praise.\n\nAs of late 2005 the founding members Alex Spyropoulos and Patrick Campbell-Lyons are still sporadically writing and recording.\n\n---\n\n3) Nirvana was a short-lived Finnish punk band formed in 1980, whose sole release was a 7\" vinyl with tracks \"Kielletyt leikit\" and \"Kuljen kaupungilla\" with 200 pressings.\n\n---\n\n4) Nirvana was a Dutch pop group, formed in 1985 by producers Bernard Oattes and Rob van Schaik. The group consisted of Anthony Moendir, Frits Broekrits and Annie Alberti and have released one single, \"Say When\", which became a big hit. The group split up in 1987.\n\n---\n\n5) Nirvana is a side project of The Skaters' James Ferraro. Primitive droning drum beats and swirling synthesizers.\n\n---\n\n6) Nirvana was a Slovenian hard-rock band in the early seventies. They appear on several collections (YU Record Collector Dream, Boom Festival 72). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100, the song was also the number-one R&B single for nine weeks in the United States and is one of Jackson's most critically acclaimed songs. It was voted best single of the year in The Village Voice Jazz & Pop critics' poll, and received two Grammy Awards in 1984 in the categories Best Male R&B Vocal Performance and Best New Rhythm & Blues Song. It was nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year, along with \"Beat It\", at the Grammy Awards of 1984. In 2005, Blender magazine recognized Billie Jean as the greatest song since 1980. It's also his best-selling single worldwide, with 5.25 million copies sold, and contributed to the immense sales of the album Thriller.\n\nJackson started writing the first demo of the song in his home in Wilson, North Carolina in the fall of 1981. When he presented the song to his co-producer Quincy Jones, Jones had problems with the title and wanted to call the song \"Not My Lover\". He thought when audiences heard it they would assume Jackson was referring to tennis superstar Billie Jean King. He also had complaints about the length of the song's intro, believing it was too long; Jackson replied that the long intro made him want to dance. Jackson won both arguments: he got to keep the title of the song and the intro.\n\nThe introduction of the character Billie Jean is foreshadowed by a four-line reference from the album's first track Wanna Be Startin' Somethin', another Jackson-penned song. In the third verse, it's evident that Billie Jean doesn't have the singer's best interests at heart, \"tellin' lies and rubbin' shoulders,\" but her dismissal is casual: \"So they called her mouth a motor.\" However, coupled with her appearance on the second side of the album, the listener is made privy to the earliest of Jackson's lyrics to deal with the subject of celebrity suspicion of those in their periphery (media, groupies, etc.). This marked a subtle but important occasional shift in the entertainer's material toward somewhat more adult themes.\n\nJackson is said to have recorded his lead vocal performance on the first take. But it was Jackson's arrangements and orchestration in \"Billie Jean\" that helped make the song unique. Jackson had wanted to write \"the perfect bass line\" and has said he worked on it for a couple of weeks until he succeeded with what became the basis of the final product. He had also arranged the drum and synthesizer lines into perfect order, and with help from co-collaborator Jerry Hey on the strings and horns and Jackson's mastery at multi-tracking his voice for background vocals, completed the final production on \"Billie Jean\" only weeks before Epic's scheduled release of the Thriller album on November 30, 1982. \"Billie Jean\" officially became the second single from Thriller when it was released in January 1983. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/_/Billie+Jean\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is the seventh and final single from his sixth studio album Thriller. It was released on January 23, 1984 by Epic Records. The song has appeared on multiple greatest hits compilation albums from Jackson, including HIStory: Past, Present, and Future, Book I (1995), Number Ones (2003), The Essential Michael Jackson (2005), and Michael Jackson's This Is It (2009). The song, which has a voice-over from actor Vincent Price, had originally been titled \"Starlight.\"\n \nThe song's instruments include a bassline and synthesizer. In the song, sound effects such as a creaking door, thunder, feet walking on wooden planks, winds and howling dogs can be heard, and the lyrics contain frightening themes and elements. \"Thriller\" received positive reviews from critics, though the song was outshone by its music video. \"Thriller\" became Jackson's seventh top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart from the album, while reaching the top of the charts in France and Belgium and the top ten in other countries.\n \n\"Thriller\" was adapted into a highly successful music video, known independently as Michael Jackson's Thriller. At fourteen minutes the video is substantially longer than the song, which ties together a narrative featuring Jackson and actress Ola Ray in a setting heavily inspired by horror films of the 1950s. In the video's most iconic scene, Jackson leads other actors costumed as zombies in a choreographed dance routine. Though it garnered some criticism for its occult theme and violent imagery, the video was immediately popular and received high critical acclaim, being nominated for six MTV Video Music Awards in 1984 and winning three. In 2009 it was added to the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, the first music video ever selected.\n \n\"Thriller\" has been covered by multiple recording artists since its release in 1984, including Henry Mancini (with The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra), Ian Brown, Ten Masked Men, and Imogen Heap. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/_/Thriller\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released in November, 11 1991. \"Black or White\" is a mix of rock, and dance-pop.Written, composed, and arranged by Jackson with the rap lyrics by Bill Bottrell, it is a song that promotes racial harmony. The song's introduction and main riff are performed by guitarist Slash and Bill Bottrell.\n\nThe song peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, the UK Singles Chart and in 20 other countries. It reached #1 on many singles charts in 1991, as well as becoming the second-best selling single of 1991.\n\nTo prepare the audience for the special occasion of the televised premiere of the \"Black or White\" video, Epic records released the song (without the accompanying images) to radio stations just two days in advance. In a period of twenty-four hours, \"Black or White\", described by the record company as \"a rock 'n' roll dance song about racial harmony\", had been added to the playlists of 96 percent of 237 of the United States of America's top forty radio stations the first day of release.\n\n\"Black or White\" was the first single off of Dangerous, produced by Michael Jackson and Bill Bottrell, it began to be promoted on radio stations the first week of November 1991 in New York and Los Angeles. \"Black or White\" was officially released one week later. It was written and composed by Jackson with rap lyrics by Bill Bottrell, the song's introduction and main riff were played by Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash and Bill Bottrell.\n\n\"Black or White\" is also described as a mix of hard rock, dance and rap, but basically it is a hard rock song like \"Beat It\". These songs are also compared by Rolling Stone's Allan Light in his Dangerous review, he says, \"Neither this slow-burn solo nor the Stones-derived riff on 'Black or White' offers the catharsis of Eddie Van Halen's blazing break on 'Beat It'\".\n\n\"Black or White\" stormed into Billboard's Hot 100 at number thirty five. A week later it shot up to number three and on its third week, December 7 1991, it ascended to number one, making it the fastest chart topper since the Beatles' \"Get Back\" also won the Hot 100 in just three weeks in 1969. It achieved the year at number one, and remained at the top of the singles chart into 1992, for a total of seven weeks, making Michael Jackson the first artist to get number one popular hits in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThe single also made an extraordinary and amazing debut in the UK, where it became the first single by an American to go into the singles chart at number one since 1960, when \"It's Now Or Never\" by Elvis Presley did in the same manner. Around the world, \"Black or White\" hit number one in the US, UK, Mexico, Cuba, Zimbabwe, Australia, New Zealand, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Israel, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweeden, Switzerland and the Euro Chart Hot 100, number two in Germany and number three in Holland.

Initially, Porcaro had recorded a rough demo of the song on a cassette, which was then given to Jones. Enjoying the demo, Jones had the ballad included on the Thriller album. The song was the last selected for the album, removing \"Carousel\" from the final track listing.\n \n\"Human Nature\" was released on July 3, 1983, as the album's fifth single. Although not released in the UK, the song achieved chart success in the US. Reaching number two on Billboard's Hot Adult Contemporary chart and number seven on the Hot 100, the song became Jackson's fifth Top 10 hit from Thriller. In New Zealand the single reached number 11. The ballad garnered many positive reviews from music critics. \"Human Nature\" has been covered and sampled by numerous artists, including Stevie Wonder, John Mayer, Miles Davis, SWV, Nas, and Chris Brown.\n \n\"Human Nature\" was written and composed by Steve Porcaro of Toto and John Bettis for Michael Jackson's Thriller album. Initially, Porcaro recorded a rough demo of the song on a cassette. Fellow Toto band member David Paich then gave the demo, along with two songs written by Paich, to producer Quincy Jones, hoping they would be included on Thriller. Jones didn't like Paich's songs, but enjoyed the rough demo of \"Human Nature\" at the end of the cassette. Jones explained, \"All of a sudden, at the end, there was all this silence, there was: 'why, why, dah dah da-dum dah dah, why, why'. Just a dummy lyric and a very skeletal thing\u2014I get goosebumps talking about it. I said, 'This is where we wanna go, because it's got such a wonderful flavor.'\" Bettis, who had written lyrics for hits by The Carpenters and The Pointer Sisters, among others, was asked to add lyrics to the song. He completed the song in two days. The producer asked if the song could be included on Jackson's album, to which Porcaro and Bettis agreed. \"Human Nature\" was the last song selected for Thriller, ousting \"Carousel\" from the final track listing. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/_/Human+Nature\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Lyrics: Chorus: I said you wanna be startin' somethin' You got to be startin' somethin' I said..."}, "description": "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' is a 1983 single released from Michael Jackson's multi-platinum selling 1982 album Thriller. It was the first track on the album, and the fourth song released as a single, following \"The Girl Is Mine\", \"Billie Jean\", and \"Beat It\".\n\nThe song was originally written in 1979 and intended for his Off the Wall album but was not recorded until the sessions for Thriller in 1982.\n\nAt six minutes and three seconds, \"Wanna Be Startin Somethin'\" is also the longest song on Thriller, ushering in the album in a buoyantly accessible way, and cannily showcasing the pop/funk sensibilities of Jackson and producer Jones. As usual with Jackson, who used the latest in studio technology, the opening snare hits of the song came courtesy of the Fairlight CMI, a $30,000 Australian sampler and synthesizer.\n\n\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" continued the trend of hit singles for Jackson, eventually peaking at number five on the Pop and on the R&B charts, and gaining time on radio playlists across the country. The song was often not played at full length, however, due to industry format standards.\n\nOne of the songs released as a single without an accompanying video, \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" nonetheless has attained a popularity rivaling its sister compositions on the album, and has become Jackson's song of choice for opening live concerts. Not being as strictly associated with a specific dance routine as those others has arguably allowed for more flexibility in performances and staging.\n\nTwo notable occurrences during live performances are the physically complicated \"stop/start\" dance technique that brings Jackson and his dancers to a frozen stop several times, and the sing-along between performer and audience during the bridge.\n\n\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" was also used on every set list of Jackson's tours, from the Victory Tour in 1984, right the way through to the HIStory Tour in 1997. Unlike most of the other songs performed live, \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" has never been lip-synched during any of Jackson's tours.\n\nThe song was re-recorded by Jackson and R&B artist Akon for the 2008 album Thriller 25. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/_/Wanna+Be+Startin%27+Somethin%27\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song remains one of the most controversial pieces Jackson ever composed. In the US, media scrutiny surrounding alleged anti-semitic lyrics were the catalyst for Jackson issuing multiple apologies and censoring of questionable lyrics. The singer countered allegations of antisemitism, arguing that reviews had misinterpreted the context of the song, either unintentionally or deliberately. Musically, it is an aggressive hip-hop production about social ills.\nThe song was accompanied by two music videos directed by Spike Lee. The first was shot in a shantytown of Rio de Janeiro, where State authorities tried to ban all production over fears the video would damage their image, the area and prospects of staging the 2004 Olympics. Still, the residents of the area were happy to see the singer, hoping their problems would be made visible to a wider audience. The second video was shot in a prison and contained video footage of multiple references to human rights abuses.\nCommercially, the song became a top ten hit in all European countries. In the US, radio stations were reluctant to play the controversial composition; it, however, managed to peak at number 30 on the Billboard Hot 100. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/_/They+Don%27t+Care+About+Us\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is a ballad that incorporates elements of blues, gospel and opera. Jackson had a long-standing history of releasing socially conscious material such as \"We Are the World\", \"Man in the Mirror\" and \"Heal the World\". However, \"Earth Song\" was the first that overtly dealt with the environment and animal welfare. The song was written and composed by Jackson; the task of production was split between Jackson, David Foster and Bill Bottrell.\nReviews were generally favorable, but some charged that the song sounded pompous, even if unintentional. \"Earth Song\" was accompanied by a lavish music video shot on four geographical regions. It centered around the destruction and rebirth of Earth and went on to receive a Grammy nomination in 1997. The song was a top five hit in most European countries.

The music video features children living in countries suffering from unrest. It is also one of only a handful of Michael Jackson's videos not to feature Jackson himself, the others being \"Cry\", \"HIStory\" and \"Man in the Mirror\". (The clips for \"HIStory\" and \"Man in the Mirror\" only feature Michael Jackson in archival footage). Jackson performed the song in the Super Bowl XXVII halftime show with a 35000 person flash card performance.\n\nIn a 2001 Internet chat with fans, Jackson said \"Heal the World\" is the song he is most proud to have created. He also created the Heal the World Foundation, a charitable organization which was designed to improve the lives of children. The organization was also meant to teach children how to help others. This concept of 'betterment for all' would become a centerpiece for the Dangerous World Tour. In the documentary Living with Michael Jackson, Jackson said he created the song in his \"Giving Tree\" at the Neverland Ranch.\n\nThe song reached #2 in the UK Singles Chart in December 1992, kept off the #1 position by Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\". It fared less well in the US, reaching a peak of #27 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming his second consecutive single not to reach the Top 20. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/_/Heal+the+World\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Siedah Garrett \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" was the lead single off of Jackson's much-anticipated \"Bad\" album, Written and composed by Michael Jackson...."}, "description": "\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" is a popular ballad by singers Michael Jackson and Siedah Garrett. It was recorded in 1982 with overdubbed vocals by Siedah Garrett in 1987. Written and composed by Jackson, it was originally intended to be a duet between Jackson and his woman of choice: either Barbra Streisand or Whitney Houston. Even Aretha Franklin and Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog (formally of ABBA) were offered the song, but all four had other obligations. However, songwriter and Quincy Jones protege Garrett, who wrote Jackson's memorable \"Man in the Mirror\", volunteered to sing with Jackson thus giving Garrett her first hit since Dennis Edwards' 1984 hit, \"Don't Look Any Further\". \nGarrett is quoted in The Billboard Book of Number One Hits by Fred Bronson that she was unaware she would be singing the song - although she had received a tape of it - until the day of the recording session, when Jones told her to step up to the microphone and sing it with Jackson. The song became the first of five consecutive number-one Billboard Hot 100 singles from Jackson's Bad album. It also reached number one on the R&B and Adult Contemporary charts, Jackson's second number-one song on the AC chart (his first, coincidentally, had also been a duet: 1982's \"The Girl Is Mine\" with Paul McCartney). It was released without an accompanying music video.\n\nAccording to the  I Just Can't Stop Loving You Songfacts, on the album, this song begins with a spoken intro: Jackson saying, \"A lot of people misunderstand me. That's because they don't know me at all.\" His producer Quincy Jones had the idea to insert this intro, which gave a telling insight into Jackson's personality.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/_/I+Just+Can%27t+Stop+Loving+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It only appeared on the CD versions of the album and was not issued as a single in the United States. The song was also featured as a segment in Jackson's 1988 fantasy movie Moonwalker and charted at #2 in the UK. The song was re-released on April 17, 2006 as part of the Visionary: The Video Singles set.\n\nDespite the success of the single, this song never appeared on any of Jackson's world tours.\n\n\nMusic Video\n\nThe music video for \"Leave Me Alone\" won the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video at the Grammy Awards of 1990. The video was also featured in Moonwalker. In essence, the video is an amusement park consisting of stylistically crude images based around Jackson's successful career since 1982's Thriller. Consistent with the song's lyrical content, there is an emphasis on the tabloid view of Jackson's personal life and public image, referring to the nickname \"Wacko Jacko\" given to him by the press, and the various headlines associated with him in the 1980s. Lampooning rumours that he tried to purchase the \"Elephant Man's\" bones, Jackson dances with stop motion \"Elephant Man\" bones in the video. This particular segment (without the image of the bones) was used for the single's cover art. At the end of the video, it is revealed that a gigantic Jackson himself is the amusement park. He breaks free, tearing the park to pieces. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/_/Leave+Me+Alone\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The single was never released in North America or Asia.\nAccording to Jackson - when he was interviewed by Oprah  - the video from Give In To Me was shot in just about 2 hours in Germany in late August 1992. The pyrotechnics appearing on the video are computer generated and were added later on.\nThe single release is notable for its B-sides, which include the album versions of \"Dirty Diana\" and \"Beat It\", two songs which also include guest appearances by rock guitarists (Steve Stevens and Eddie Van Halen, respectively).

Jackson is an inductee of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and double inductee to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. His awards include 8 Guinness World Records, 13 Grammy Awards, and 26 Billboard Awards. He is also credited for popularizing many physically complicated dance moves, such as the robot and the moonwalk, and has influenced and spawned a whole generation of a wide variety of artists including Justin Timberlake, Mariah Carey and Usher, among others.\n\nJackson's musical career began in 1967 as lead singer of The Jackson 5, when the group made their first recording with a local label before signing up with Motown Records in 1968. He made his first solo recordings in 1971 while still a member of the group. But it was Off the Wall (1979) which marked the start of his full-fledged solo career, and he formally parted with his siblings in 1984. In his solo career, Jackson recorded and co-produced the best-selling album of all time, Thriller (with worldwide sales over 100 million), received thirteen Grammy awards and charted thirteen #1 singles in the U.S. Throughout his four-decade career, Michael Jackson has been awarded numerous honors, including the World Music Awards Best-selling Pop Male Artist of the Millennium. He is also a double-inductee into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of The Jackson 5 in 1997, and in 2001 as a solo artist. He is also a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In the mid-1980s, TIME magazine described Jackson as \"the hottest single phenomenon since Elvis Presley\". He has had a notable impact on music and culture throughout the world while also tearing down racial barriers and paving the way for modern pop music.\n\nFrom 1988 to 2005, Jackson lived on his Neverland Ranch property, on which he built an amusement park and private zoo for the enjoyment of economically disadvantaged and terminally ill children. In 1993 and 2003, separate accusations of child molestation that allegedly occurred in Neverland were made against Jackson, which drew intense negative media coverage. While he was never charged for the first case, Jackson was tried and vindicated in 2005 of the latter allegation, but moved out of the US shortly thereafter. He later returned to Las Vegas in early 2007. \n\nOver the past few years Jackson has made numerous public appearances including MTV Japan's VMA awards where he accepted the legends award; the World Music Awards where he accepted the Diamond Award for selling over 100 million records; James Brown's funeral where he paid tribute and delivered his sermon; and a fan appreciation event in Tokyo, Japan, where he also greeted troops at US Army base Camp Zama. In early 2008, Jackson issued Thriller 25th Anniversary, a critical, and commercial success that is currently the second-biggest selling album of 2008 with over 2.1 million copies sold worldwide.\n\nOn June 25, 2009, Jackson collapsed at a rented home in Holmby Hills in Los Angeles, California. The cause of death is currently believed to be cardiac arrest. At the time of his death, Jackson was scheduled to perform 50 sold-out concerts to over one million people, at London's O2 arena, from July 13, 2009, to March 6, 2010. During a publicity press conference, Jackson made suggestions of possible retirement.\n\nIn the hours following Jackson's death, his record sales increased dramatically. His seminal album Thriller climbed to number one on the American iTunes music chart, while another eight have made it into the top 40. In the UK, where Jackson would have performed less than three weeks after his death, fifteen of his albums occupied the top 15 spots on the Amazon music chart. Social music network website Last.fm also saw a dramatic increase in Michael Jackson plays per hour after the announcement of his death.\n\nOn December 10, 2010, a compilation album of previously unreleased material, simply entitled Michael, was released posthumously. Featuring guest performances by Akon, 50 Cent and Lenny Kravitz, the album was certified Platinum in 18 countries but received mixed reviews from most critics.  This was followed in November 2011 by Immortal, a remix album; in September 2012 by Bad 25, a 25th anniversary reissue of Jackson's 1987 hit album Bad; and by  Xscape, a second compilation album released in May 2014.\n\nOfficial website: http://www.michaeljackson.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It reached number one in both the U.S. and the UK charts in 1966. It was released as a single and included on the U.S. version of the album Aftermath. In 2004 it was ranked #174 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nThe song began with Wyman playing organ at a recording session, in parody of the group's former co-manager Eric Easton, who had been an organist. Charlie Watts accompanied the organ by playing a vaguely Middle Eastern drum part; Watts' drum pattern became the basis for the final song. Brian Jones contributed the song's signature sitar riff (having taught himself to play after a visit with George Harrison) and acoustic guitar, and Jagger contributed the lyrics, seemingly about a man mourning his dead girlfriend. The lead electric guitar and the background vocals are provided by Richards. The piano is played by Jack Nitzsche, unfortunately not in any way related to Friedrich Nietzsche, the famous German philosopher.\n\nThe bass was also overdubbed by Bill Wyman playing on the bass pedals of a Hammond B3 organ.\n\nRichards has stated in an interview that the song was not intended to have a comma in its title, and that this was added by the record label. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/_/Paint+It+Black\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Personnel included on the recording include Nicky Hopkins on piano; Rocky Dijon on congas; Bill Wyman on maracas. Marianne Faithfull, Anita Pallenberg, Brian Jones, Charlie Watts, producer Jimmy Miller, Wyman and Richards can be seen performing backup vocals in the film Sympathy for the Devil by Jean-Luc Godard, but this scene was staged specially for the cameras; the actual backing vocals were overdubbed by Jagger, Richards and Miller. Richards plays bass on the original recording, and also the song's electric-guitar solo.\n\nCover Versions:\nThe song has been widely covered since its release, including: September 1973 Bryan Ferry's solo effort departure from Roxy Music in These Foolish Things (album), a notable version by Jane's Addiction that was included on their 1987 self-titled live album, a much darker and complex version by jazz-rock band Blood, Sweat & Tears, called \"Symphony For the Devil\", from the group's Third Album, Inkubus Sukkubus on the album Science and Nature in 2007, Electric Hellfire Club for their 2000 album Empathy for the Devil, Tiamat on their 1999 album, Skeleton Skeletron, Sandie Shaw for her album Reviewing the Situation. In 1991, industrial metal band Skrew included a drastically rearranged cover of the song on their debut album, Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame. In 2005, Ozzy Osbourne released a cover on his box set Prince of Darkness and the related Under Cover release. The Residents perform the two quodlibet as the finale to their album The Third Reich 'n' Roll.\n\nAmerican hard rock group Guns N' Roses recorded a cover in 1994 which featured in the closing credits of Neil Jordan's film adaptation of Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire and was a bonus track on their Greatest Hits album. This cover is notable for causing an incident within the group that was partially responsible for guitarist Slash departing from the band in 1996. The incident was when Paul Tobias, a friend of Axl Rose, recorded a guitar over Slash's guitar without his consent. Slash later stated that this was one incident that prompted him to leave the band. He has described the Guns N' Roses version of the song as 'the sound of a band breaking up'.\n\nIn 1996, Natalie Merchant released a live cover of the song. Pearl Jam's \"The Water Pouring Song (live)\" included an instrumental section of \"Sympathy for the Devil\". A snippet of the song is often sung by Bono along with \"Ruby Tuesday\" during performances of \"Bad\" at U2 concerts, most notably performed at Live Aid in London as well as on the concert film Rattle and Hum.\n\nIn 1989, the Slovenian band Laibach released an EP of seven different versions of the song, interpreted as everything from a Wagnerian symphony to a light techno number. A October 31, 1987 version of the song also appears on Widespread Panic's album of live cover songs, Jackassolantern, released in 2004.\n\nIn 2006, another cover was made in an Uruguayan rhythm 'murga' by Argentinian Diego Capusotto for his sketch comedy 'Peter Capusotto y sus videos'. In 2008, Wandering Gauchos of Senegal recorded the song for their debut album 'Que Pasa, Diablo?'. This album was released in benefit of fellow refugee Senegalese in Australia. This song was recorded by an assortment of musicians from all over the world including Indonesia, Malaysia, South Africa, and Australia. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/_/Sympathy+for+the+Devil\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Richards had been working on the song's signature opening in London while Jagger was working on the film Performance. The song takes the form of a churning mid-tempo rocker. It begins with a rhythm guitar intro by Richards, followed by Jagger's lead vocal. On the recording of the album, Jagger said in a 1995 interview with Rolling Stone, \"Well, it's a very rough, very violent era. The Vietnam War. Violence on the screens, pillage and burning. And Vietnam was not war as we knew it in the conventional sense...\" On the song itself, he concluded, \"That's a kind of end-of-the-world song, really. It's apocalypse; the whole record's like that.\"\n\nThe lyrics of the song speak of seeking shelter from a coming storm, painting a picture of devastation and social apocalypse while also talking of the power of love:\n\n\u201c Oh, a storm is threat'ning, My very life today; If I don't get some shelter, Oh yeah, I'm gonna fade away \u201d \n\u201c War, children, it's just a shot away, It's just a shot away; War, children, it's just a shot away, It's just a shot away\"\n\nThe track was used to great effect in the Martin Scorses 1995 classic, 'Casino' adding period  atmosphere as only great music can.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/_/Gimme+Shelter\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Rolling Stone magazine ranked the song as number 2 on its 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, while VH1 placed it at number 1 on its \"100 Greatest Songs of Rock & Roll\" list. In 2006 it was added to the Library of Congress National Recording Registry.\n\nThe song was first released as a single in the United States in June 1965 and was also featured on the American version of the Rolling Stones album Out of Our Heads, released in July of the same year. \"Satisfaction\" was a smash hit, giving the Stones their first number one in the United States. In Europe, the song initially played only on pirate radio stations because its lyrics were considered too sexually suggestive. In Britain the single was released in August 1965, and shot to number one in the United Kingdom; it was the Rolling Stones' fourth UK number one. (The British version of Out of Our Heads, released in September 1965, did not feature \"Satisfaction\"; it was not standard practice in the United Kingdom at that time to include previously-released singles on albums.)\n\nThe lyrics of the song include references to sexual intercourse, and the theme of anti-commercialism caused the song to be \"perceived as an attack on the status quo\".\n\nOtis Redding, Devo, Blue Cheer, Gloria Trevi, Alejandra Guzm\u00e1n, Vanilla Ice, Britney Spears, The Residents, The Supremes and Cat Power are among the artists who have covered the song. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/_/(I+Can%27t+Get+No)+Satisfaction\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, it was named as the 100th greatest song of all time by Rolling Stone (magazine) in its 2004 list of \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\"\n\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" was recorded on November 16 and November 17, 1968 at London's Olympic Sound Studios. It features the London Bach Choir powerfully opening the song under the stewardship of Javier Sanchez Broto, highlighting throughout, and bringing it to an uproarious conclusion. Jimmy Miller, the Rolling Stones' producer at the time, plays drums on this song instead of Charlie Watts. Al Kooper plays piano, organ and horn while Rocky Dijon plays congas and maracas. Nanette Workman sings backup vocals, but she is credited as \"Nanette Newman\".\n\nOf the song, Jagger said in 2003, \"'You Can't Always Get What You Want' was something I just played on the acoustic guitar - one of those bedroom songs. It proved to be quite difficult to record because Charlie couldn't play the groove and so Jimmy Miller had to play the drums. I'd also had this idea of having a choir, probably a gospel choir, on the track, but there wasn't one around at that point. Jack Nitzsche, or somebody, said that we could get the London Bach Choir and we said, 'That will be a laugh.'\"[1]\n\nIn his review of the song, Richie Unterberger says, \"If you buy John Lennon's observation that the Rolling Stones were apt to copy the Beatles' innovations within a few months or so, \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" is the Rolling Stones' counterpart to 'Hey Jude.'\" Jagger said in 1969, \"I liked the way the Beatles did that with 'Hey Jude'. The orchestra was not just to cover everything up - it was something extra. We may do something like that on the next album.\"[2]\n\nThe three verses (along with the varied theme in the 4th verse) address the major topics of the 1960s: love, politics, and drugs. Each verse captures the essence of the initial optimism and eventual disillusion, followed by the resigned pragmatism in the chorus.\n\nUnterberger concludes of the song, \"Much has been made of the lyrics reflecting the end of the overlong party that was the 1960s, as a snapshot of Swinging London burning out. That's a valid interpretation, but it should also be pointed out that there's also an uplifting and reassuring quality to the melody and performance. This is particularly true of the key lyrical hook, when we are reminded that we can't always get what we want, but we'll get what we need.\"\n\nRelease and aftermath\nThough popular on modern classic rock radio stations, \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" was not released as a single, but rather as the B-Side to \"Honky Tonk Women\", albeit in an edited form (4:49). One of the Stones' most popular recordings, it has since appeared on the compilations Hot Rocks, Singles Collection and Forty Licks.\n\n\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" is very popular at Stones shows due to the sing-along chorus, and is played at almost every show (where it is custom for Jagger to change the lyrics from \"my favourite flavour, cherry red\" to the question \"What's your favourite flavour?\" to which the audience replies \"Cherry red\"). Live recordings appear on the albums Love You Live, Flashpoint, Live Licks, and The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/_/You+Can%27t+Always+Get+What+You+Want\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Its first appearance was as an album track on 1966's Aftermath, and though it was never released as a single, it is one of the band's more popular songs from the period, appearing frequently on best-of compilations.\n\nThe song's lyrics, an examination of a sexual power struggle, were very much in tune with the rebellious, vaguely misogynistic attitude that the mid-'60s Stones had cultivated, though the concept of Under My Thumb is arguably more sophisticated--even psychological--than any of the other controversial songs the Stones had released up to that point.\n\nJagger's lyrics celebrate the satisfaction of finally having controlled and gained leverage over a previously pushy, dominating woman. Many listeners also note that the woman who is the subject of the song was previously the dominant figure in the relationship, and that the narrator was originally submissive to her, making the implications of the song more complicated than simple chauvinism.\n\nJagger later reflected on the track in a 1995 interview: \"It's a bit of a jokey number, really. It's not really an anti-feminist song any more than any of the others... Yes, it's a caricature, and it's in reply to a girl who was a very pushy woman\".\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/_/Under+My+Thumb\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

While the Rolling Stones had already laid the track to tape, the Burrito Brothers' version was actually the first to be released, appearing on their second album, Burrito Deluxe, in April 1970- one year before \"Sticky Fingers.\"\n\nReleased as the second (U.S.-only) single in June 1971, \"Wild Horses\" reached #28 on the singles chart. Although popular at the Stones' live shows, \"Wild Horses\" has only been released in a reworked version on the 1995 acoustic/live album Stripped.\n\nIt has proven to be a popular cover song for other artists, eventually leading the Rolling Stones to re-release it as a single in 1996. It has been covered by Leon Russell, The Cranberries, Elvis Costello, Neil Young, Old and in the Way, The Sundays, Guns N' Roses, Bush, Labelle, The Lovemongers with Chris Cornell, Jewel, Dave Matthews, Garbage, Charlotte Martin, Chantal Kreviazuk, Alicia Keys ft.

The song is an acoustic guitar driven ballad which tells of the end of a romance. The song is noted for its poignant lyrics concerning lost love and the grieving involved. Singer Mick Jagger gives a wrenching performance for the recording, while Stones-recording regular Nicky Hopkins plays the song's distinctive piano chords. The strings on the piece (as well as \"Winter\") were arranged by Nicky Harrison.\n\nReleased as a single in August 1973, \"Angie\" went straight to the top of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and reached number five on the UK singles chart.\n\nQuestions about the song's origins have never ceased. Despite wide-ranging rumors that \"Angie\" was written by Jagger about a relationship he had with David Bowie's wife Angela, Jagger denies this. Richards claims to have come up with the title and chord sequence a year before production on the album began. In the liner notes to the compilation disc Jump Back, Richards says, \"I'd recently had my daughter born, whose name was Angela, and the name was starting to ring around the house. 'Angie' just fitted.\"\n\nThe Rolling Stones have frequently performed the song in concert; it was included in set lists on their 1973, 1975 and 1976 tours, and on every tour since their 1982 European tour. Concert renditions have been released on the albums Stripped and Live Licks.\n\nTwo music videos were shot to promote the song.\n\nIn 2005 the German party CDU used the song for its election campaign for Angela Merkel; the Rolling Stones had not given Merkel permission to use the song. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/_/Angie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Lead guitarist Ronnie Wood can clearly be heard playing a layered variation of Richards' main riff. Often live versions of the song are lengthened by giving Wood a solo near the middle of the song, pieces of which can be heard throughout the original recording.\n\n'Start Me Up' peaked at No. 7 on the UK Singles Charts in August 1981., where it remains a significant single as the Stones have not been back into the UK Top 10 since.

In 2004 Rolling Stone magazine ranked the song #435 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\nRecording on \"Beast of Burden\" began in October of 1977 and ended in December of that same year. Although written before entering the studio, many of the lyrics were improvised by Jagger to fit with the smooth running guitars of Richards and Wood. Note the rolling, fluid licks traded off by the two. Neither is really playing lead or rhythm; they both slip in and out, one playing high while the other is low. The song is another of the famed Some Girls songs which feature each member of the band playing their respective instruments without any outside performers; both Richards and Wood play acoustic and electric guitars, with Wood performing the solo.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/_/Beast+of+Burden\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Although guitarist Keith Richards is credited for co-writing, Jagger is generally regarded as the principal composer.\n\nSeveral of the songs on 1976's Black and Blue had been influenced by dance music. \"Miss You\" was the first Rolling Stones single with prominent disco influences, most noticeably in Charlie Watts' thumping, four-on-the-floor drum beat, and in Bill Wyman's funky, grooving bass-lines, which provide another riff in addition to the main melody. That melody, sung in playful falsetto by Jagger, or else intoned by a chorus of dreamy, borderline-campy backup singers, forms the principal hook used throughout the track, often underlined by Sugar Blue's harmonica lines and incisive solos. The funky beat and the rapping during the verses are reminiscent of hip-hop, although it would be a couple of years before hip-hop was commonly recognized as a distinct genre in its own right.\n\nUnlike most of the Stones songs on Some Girls, \"Miss You\" features several studio musicians. In addition to Sugar Blue, Ian McLagan supplies electric piano, which fits into the overall groove of the song to the point that it is barely audible, and Mel Collins provides the glitzy saxophone solos heard during the instrumental break. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/_/Miss+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was a number-one hit in the US and a number three in the UK. It was released as a single but it appeared later that week on the album Between the Buttons.\n\nAccording to Keith Richards in a 1971 Rolling Stone interview, he wrote the song in a Los Angeles hotel room in early 1966 about a groupie he knew. He has also stated that it was about Linda Keith, his girlfriend in the mid-1960s. The song's lyrics concern an apparently free-spirited woman, with Jagger singing, \"Who could hang a name on you?/When you change with every new day/Still I'm gonna miss you.\"\n\n\"That's a wonderful song,\" Mick Jagger told Jann Wenner (Rolling Stone magazine) in 1995. \"It's just a nice melody, really. And a lovely lyric. Neither of which I wrote, but I always enjoy singing it.\"Bill Wyman states in Rolling with the Stones (BW's diary later released in bookform) that the song was completely written by Keith Richards. However, Marianne Faithfull says in her biography that the song was written by Brian Jones, and that Keith Richards only added minor parts\n\nRolling Stone magazine ranked the song #303 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/_/Ruby+Tuesday\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Released as a single on 4 July 1969 in the UK and a week later in the US, it topped the charts in both nations.\n\nTwo versions of the song were recorded by the band: the familiar hit which appeared on the 45 single and their collection of late 1960s singles, Through The Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2); and a honky-tonk version entitled \"Country Honk\" with slightly different lyrics, which appeared on Let it Bleed. The concert rendition of the song featured on Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out differs from both the hit version and the country version, with a markedly different guitar introduction and an entirely different second verse.\n\nThe song was written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards while on vacation in Brazil from late December 1968 to early January 1969. Inspired by Brazilian gauchos at the ranch where Jagger and Richards were staying, the song was originally conceived as an acoustic country song. Richards has said: \"[It] was originally written as a real Hank Williams/Jimmie Rogers/1930s country song.\"\n\nThematically, a \"honky tonk woman\" refers to a dancing girl in a western bar who may work as a prostitute; the setting for the narrative in the first verse of the blues version is Memphis, while \"Country Honk\" sets the first verse in Jackson.\n\nRecorded in London in early February 1969 without Brian Jones, the band initially recorded the track called \"Country Honk\". The song was transformed into the familiar electric, riff-based hit single \"Honky Tonk Women\" sometime in the spring of 1969, prior to Mick Taylor's joining the group. Taylor was quoted in Sean Egan's The Making of Let It Bleed as stating that the basic backing track was already recorded before he added his lead fill overdubs.\n\nThe song is distinctive as it opens not with a guitar riff, but with a beat played on a cowbell. The Rolling Stones' producer Jimmy Miller performed the cowbell for the recording.\n\nRy Cooder has asserted that he originated the song's main guitar riff, and has accused the Stones of \"ripping him off\". Rolling Stones pianist Ian Stewart said of the track: \"It's bloody ten times Keith you hear.\"\n\nThe song topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks from 23 August 1969. The single was released in the UK the day after the death of founding member Brian Jones. \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" was the single's B-side. Concert versions of \"Honky Tonk Women\" are included on the albums Love You Live and Live Licks, as well as the aforementioned Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!.\n\nRolling Stone ranked \"Honky Tonk Women\" #116 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/_/Honky+Tonk+Women\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was included on the U.S. version of the Stones' album \"Between the Buttons\", and was also released there as a single. However, due to the then-controversial nature of the lyrics (proposing a sexual encounter) most radio stations opted to play the flip side 'Ruby Tuesday' instead. The two songs charted separately on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, 'Let's Spend the Night Together' stalling at #55 while 'Ruby Tuesday' became a #1 hit. \n\nIn one of the more famous examples of musical censorship, on The Ed Sullivan Show, the band was initially refused permission to perform the number. Sullivan himself told Jagger, \"Either the song goes or you go\".  A compromise was reached to substitute the words \"let's spend some time together\" in place of \"let's spend the night together\"; Jagger agreed to change the lyrics but ostentatiously rolled his eyes at the TV camera whilst singing them. In April 2006., for their first-ever performance in China, authorities prohibited the group from performing the song due to its \"suggestive lyrics\".\n\nIt has been covered by various artists, most famously David Bowie in 1973. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/_/Let%27s+Spend+the+Night+Together\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was written as a follow-up single to the successful \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\". The song topped the charts in the U.S. and the U.K. in the weeks following its release in the autumn of 1965.\n\nWritten by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, the song was recorded in early September 1965. The song is noted for its drum intro by Charlie Watts and twin guitars by Brian Jones and Keith Richards.[1] The lyrics are defiant and rebellious, which was common practice for the Rolling Stones around that time; they were beginning to cultivate their infamous \"bad boy\" image. The Stones have said that the song is written as a reaction to their sudden popularity after the success of \"Satisfaction\". The song deals with their aversion to people's expectations of them.\n\n\u201c I was sick and tired, fed up with this and decided to take a drive downtown; It was so very quiet and peaceful, there was nobody, not a soul around; I laid myself out, I was so tired and I started to dream; In the morning the parking tickets were just like a flag stuck on my windscreen \u201d \n\nOn the song, Richards said in 1971, \"I never dug it as a record. The chorus was a nice idea, but we rushed it as the follow-up. We were in L.A., and it was time for another single. But how do you follow-up \"Satisfaction\"? Actually, what I wanted was to do it slow like a Lee Dorsey thing. We rocked it up. I thought it was one of Andrew Loog Oldham's worst productions.\" [2] In a 1995 interview with Rolling Stone, Jagger said, \"That was Keith's melody and my lyrics... It's a stop-bugging-me, post-teenage-alienation song. The grown-up world was a very ordered society in the early '60s, and I was coming out of it. America was even more ordered than anywhere else. I found it was a very restrictive society in thought and behavior and dress.\" [3] In the 2003 book According to... The Rolling Stones, Richards says: \"'Get off of My Cloud' was basically a response to people knocking on our door asking us for the follow up to 'Satisfaction'... We thought, 'At last. We can sit back and maybe think about events.' Suddenly there's the knock at the door and of course what came out of that was 'Get off of My Cloud'.\"[\r\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/_/Get+Off+of+My+Cloud\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The single reached #48 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles chart.[3] \"Not Fade Away\" was not on the UK version of their debut album, The Rolling Stones, but was the opening track of the US version released a month later as England's Newest Hitmakers.

Up until that point they had been performing covers of blues standards. The myth surrounding the song's genesis has it that Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham locked Jagger and Richards in a kitchen forcing them to write a song together, even suggesting what type of song he wanted: \u201cI want a song with brick walls all around it, high windows and no sex.\u201d The result was initially named \u201cAs Time Goes By\u201d the title of the song Dooley Wilson sings in the film Casablanca. It was Oldham who changed \u201cTime\u201d for \u201cTears.\u201d Oldham subsequently gave the ballad (a format that the Stones were not yet known for) to Faithfull, then 17, for her to record as a B-side. The success of the recording caused the record company, Decca, to switch the song to an A-side, where it became a very popular single. It reached # 9 in the British charts and launched Faithfull's career as a major singer. The song entered the Billboard Hot 100 in America the week ending November 28, 1964, where it stayed for nine weeks peaking at # 22.\n\nThe Stones recorded their own version in 1965. It appeared as the B-side to \"19th Nervous Breakdown\" in the U.K. This recording is notable for its heavy string arrangement by Mike Leander. It was one of the three songs ( \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" and \"19th Nervous Breakdown\" being the other two ) the band performed live during their third appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show. It was released as a single by their American record label, London Records, due to popular demand after radio DJ's across the country started playing the song from their recently released compilation album December's Children (And Everybody's).

The guys have held a residency at DC-10 in Ibiza since 2011, and in 2014 their standing within the world of underground house and techno is solid and constantly rising \u2013 their DJ sets are full of energy, fuelled by the brothers\u2019 in-depth knowledge and an innate ability to guide the crowd.<br><br> The Martinez Brothers have produced a number of dance floor-ready releases since their earliest days at Objektivity, releasing their first EP, \u201cMy Rendition\u201d in 2006 under the guidance of Dennis Ferrer. Other highlights include one of 2013\u2032s big underground Ibiza hits, Santos Resiak\u2019s \u201cA Better Light\u201d (The Martinez Brothers Remix) on One Records. Their ubiquitously popular remix of Green Velvet\u2019s \u201cBigger Than Prince\u201d (Circus) was named the most-played dance track at ADE 2013, further showing their range as producers and delivering a dark, raw groove with cut-up vocal accents. In late 2013 / early 2014 they released the two-part hip-hop mixtape \u201cWarhol/Basquiat,\u201d which Philip Sherburne named SPIN Magazine\u2019s Dance Track of the Week, saying: \u201cAt their best, their beats have a quizzical, psychedelic feel, stretching loops of Donna Summer and George Duke into long strips of taffy and turning up the humidity until they dissolve on their own.\u201d This year they\u2019ve teamed up with DJ Gregory / Point G with \u201cWhat\u2019s the Point?\u201d the first release on his new label, Ever Lasting LovE. <br><br> 2013 marked the beginning of their homespun event series Mad Beats & Crazy Styles, offering the brothers a space to explore their New York dance music roots. They have also conceived a new record label, Cuttin\u2019 Headz, which will be a home to their musical experimentations. Also this year comes the premier of Tuskegee, the brainchild of The Martinez Brothers and Seth Troxler. Using the black and Latino musical experience in the US in the early 90s as inspiration, TMB and Troxler will be putting out a series of vinyl-only releases as well as a clothing line.<br><br> Earlier this year, The Martinez Brothers broke into the world of high fashion by traveling to Paris to provide music for Riccardo Tisci\u2019s Givenchy Menswear and Womenswear Fall / Winter 2014 /15 collections. The track \u201cFlawless\u201d has already been featured in a Style.com exclusive preview of the Nike RT Air Force 1 Collection, offering a first glimpse of Riccardo Tisci\u2019s collaboration with Nike.<br><br> This year alone the guys have been all over Europe and the Americas, they\u2019ve premiered in Australia, and have plans for a tour of Asia. While on the road they created a behind-the-scenes Coachella photo diary for Rolling Stone and Nylon Guys. Production-wise, they\u2019ve laid down some studio tracks with the legendary Nile Rodgers and have collaborated with Spanish Harlem-born hip hop star Bodega Bamz on his forthcoming mixtape. Despite the whirlwind of activity, Chris and Steve remain positive, down-to-earth guys. When asked about their achievements, they always humbly reply, \u201cWe are so blessed!\u201d</p></p>", "title": "FNGRS CRSSD presents: The Martinez Brothers", "url": "http://sandiego.eventful.com/events/fngrs-crssd-presents-martinez-brothers-/E0-001-110361312-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "SPIN Nightclub", "date": "2018-01-18 21:00:00"}, {"city": "Morgantown", "description": " Arc & Stones is a rock band born in the heart of NYC\u00a0and raised in the southern soul of Nashville.

The friction between these impulses is where good things happen, and its the place San Franciscos The Stone Foxes - spear headed by brothers Shannon Koehler (drums, harp, vocals) and Spence Koehler (lead guitar, vocals) ) - have resided since their 2008 debut, young men dedicated to keeping rock engaged and succulently alive.You do what the song needs you to do. Thats how this band does it, says Shannon. Hell, thats how The Band did it! You can go back to Muddy Waters and further for examples of this. With us, theres this filter of blues and roots that weve created by soaking up that music, and when we write everything gets put through that filter. It comes out as who we are today, but everything we do goes through that filter, this cultural fuzzbox.The bands third record, Small Fires , released in February of 2013, is a cohesive, compelling distillation of all the learning the quartet has been doing on the road the past two years since 2010s Bears & Bulls, an evolution that harnesses their significant firepower with and wrestle with the idea of conflicts, big and small.For sure its economically and politically driven, but there are still a few relationship songs in there, chuckles Shannon. With earlier albums, we were more concerned with how the music sounded than any underlying themes. This time we took the lyric writing to a new place. I think were getting better at defining who we are. With producer Doug Boehm (Girls, Dr. Dog, The Vines), The Stone Foxes cut 12 songs in 12 days at Los Angeles Carriage House, a whirlwind pace that kept things popping in real time, ideas coming fast and furious, bits of lightning captured in whatever bottle was handy.On this past tour in support of Small Fires the Stone Foxes put action to their politically driven lyrics by teaming up with SuperFood Drive to help raise awareness of hunger and homelessness in each city they visited on tour. According to SuperFood Drive 1 out of 6 people visit a food pantry because they cant afford to buy food. 50% of these people are children. This same population also tends to suffer from obesity and chronic illness like diabetes and heart disease. At every show the band encouraged fans to bring healthy nutrient filled non-perishable food, and teamed up with a local food bank where the band personally delivered all the food that was collected at the shows.While working with SuperFood drive the Stone Foxes embarked on a very unique musical collaboration with food bank and food shelter patrons. The first recording we did at a shelter was a man named Charles who had lived under a freewayreports Shannon Koehler, he sang our song about cold nights in the city. After we stopped rolling, he called me over and told me how much the song meant to him. You don&#39;t forget things like that. Goose bumps and watery eyes were the norm at these sessions. At shelters on tour and at home in San Francisco, people who know hard times have sang with us and shared their stories. It&#39;s been an honor to listen.We&#39;re just trying to share their voices. These special recordings will be released in late November in time for Thanksgiving.As for right now the Stone Foxes are focused almost solely on writing. During shows we&#39;ll be trying out some new stuff, says Shannon and then we&#39;ll huddle back in the studio and start cranking the stuff out. We&#39;re really excited about the sound. The rock is raw, blues is the filter. We can&#39;t wait to share it in the new year and get back on the road.Shannon Koehler Elliott Peltzman Vince Dewald Ben Andrews Brian Bakalian Spence Koehler", "title": "The Stone Foxes", "url": "http://losangeles.eventful.com/events/stone-foxes-/E0-001-108621366-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Saint Rocke", "date": "2018-02-03 21:00:00"}, {"city": "Salt Lake City", "description": " <br> The British Invasion brought us the two most popular rock groups of all time, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, as well as the liveliest debate in rock history - which band is the greatest?

First popular in Europe, they quickly became successful in North America during the \"British Invasion\" of the mid-60s. Since then, their worldwide sales are estimated at more than 200 million albums. In 1989, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 2004, they ranked number 4 in Rolling Stone magazine's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked the Rolling Stones at number ten on \"The Billboard Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists\", and as the second most successful group in the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nThe group was formed by Brian Jones, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Ian Stewart, who met as schoolmates in Dartford, Kent. They took their name from a Muddy Waters song called \"Rollin' Stone Blues\", and made their live debut at London's Marquee Club (minus Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts). They start playing pubs and clubs around the city and suburbs. Bill Wyman joined later that year (the popular story is that he was asked because he had his own amplifier).\n\nIn January 1963, Charlie Watts  joined the Stones. The band gigged constantly, with residencies at venues like Ealing Jazz Club, Ken Colyer's Studio 51, and Eel Pie Island in Twickenham.  Their weekly performances at the Crawdaddy at Richmond's Station Hotel resulted in ecstatic press reviews, and in April Andrew Loog Oldham saw them there and signed them to his management company the next day. He started the \"Would you let your daughter marry a Rolling Stone\" press campaign, which set the tone for their career.\n\nIn May 1963, the Stones were signed to Decca Records by the same man who had turned down the Beatles. A month later \"Come On\", the first Rolling Stones single, was released, and reached number two in the U.K. charts.\n\nThe fifth member of the group, Brian Jones, left on 8th June 1969, saying that he wanted to form a new group. He was replaced by Mick Taylor, formerly in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers.\n\nIn 1971 the Stones, whose contract with Decca had expired, launched their Rolling Stones Records label.  In December 1974 Taylor left the group in order to pursue a solo career.  He was replaced in 1975 by Ronnie Wood.\n\nSince Wyman left the Stones in 1993, the band has consisted of Jagger, Richards, Watts and guitarist Ronnie Wood. In studio and live performances, Darryl Jones (bassist) and Chuck Leavell (keyboardist) also serve as a regular contributors. \n\nIn 2005, the band released \"A Bigger Bang\". \n\nOn December 2, 2016, the band released their first studio album in over 10 days, entitled \"Blue & Lonesome\" (2016) on the Polydor label. \n\nAll the members have also undertaken solo projects of various kinds.

The song was written and composed by Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Perry for her major mainstream debut album, One of the Boys. The track was released as the album's second single. It is about an unstable heterosexual romantic relationship, told from her point of view. The chorus uses several antonyms to describe her partner's bipolar mood swings, with the verses describing how they affect the couple's life together.\n\nThe single reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100, making it Perry's second consecutive top three single, after her previous worldwide hit \"I Kissed a Girl\". The single has also become Perry's second top five single in the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand, and topped the charts in Finland, Germany, Canada, Norway, Spain and Denmark, and has topped the charts in 15 countries. \"Hot n Cold\" was nominated for the Grammy Award fo Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 52nd Grammy Awards but lost to Beyonc\u00e9's Halo.\n\nAs of September 2011, \"Hot n Cold\" has sold over five million digital downloads. Perry sang the song in Simlish for the soundtrack of Sims 2: Apartment Life. In 2010, Perry performed a version of the song with Elmo intended for the children's television show Sesame Street (to teach children about opposites) which was released on websites such as YouTube. However, the producers of Sesame Street decided not to air the segment on the show after receiving complaints that Perry's revealing wardrobe was not appropriate for children. Perry alluded to the controversy later that week on Saturday Night Live by wearing a low cut Elmo t-shirt with a short skirt.\n\nBackground\n\n\"Hot n Cold\" was confirmed as the second single from One of the Boys by Perry in an interview with Radio 1 saying that the song would in fact be the follow-up single to her number one hit \"I Kissed a Girl\" in the United Kingdom and Australia. The song went for ads on the North American radios on September 9 and remained the song with one of the biggest bullets of the entire mediabase for weeks. There are currently four radio edits: in one, \"bitch\" is replaced with the word \"chick\", (\"You PMS (pronounced like 'be a mess'), like a girl, I would know\"); in the second, mostly used on radio program Open House Party, this version uses \"girl\" instead of \"bitch\" or \"chick\" (in a version once played on Ryan Seacrest's American Top 40 radio show, the lyrics are \"You PMS, I would know\"); in another edit, the lyrics first line of the song was repeated after the line was sung in full (\"You change your mind, like a girl, I would know\"), this edit can be heard in theme parks; finally, the radio edit that is used on UK music channels cuts out the word altogether. A remixed version of the track has also been released for play in the iPhone OS game Tap Tap Revenge. The song was nominated for the 52nd Grammy Awards in the category of Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, but lost for Beyonc\u00e9's \"Halo\" and was chosen as the theme song for Channel Ten's new show MasterChef Australia in 2009. Perry said in an interview with Open House Party that the song was about ex-boyfriend Travie McCoy in the early stages of their relationship.\n\n\n\nCovers\n\nWoe, Is Me version\n\nAtlanta-based rock band, Woe, Is Me covered the track for the compilation album Punk Goes Pop 3, which was released on November 2, 2010. The song was leaked on October 6, 2010, and was officially released for digital download on October 21, 2010.\n\nOther cover versions\n\n-\"Hot n Cold\" was covered by the rockabilly coverband The Baseballs in 2009 from their debut album Strike!.\n- The song was covered by British ska and indie band Kid British on their 2009 EP iTunes Live: London Festival '09.\n-The Chipettes covered the song for the movie Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel and the movie's soundtrack. In this version the line \"You PMS, like a bitch, I would know\" is changed to \"You always stress like a chick, I would know\".\n-Brazilian girlband Valkyrias covered the song on their R\u00e1dio VKS Tour.\n-Selena Gomez & the Scene performed the song during her 2009 Selena Gomez & the Scene: Live in Concert tour.\n-Taylor Swift with Katy Perry performed the song during at the Fearless Tour on April 15, 2010 (Staples Center).\n- Aaron Lewis covers a stripped down acoustic version to tease the audience. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Katy+Perry/_/Hot+n+Cold\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was written by Perry, Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Sandy Wilhelm, Ester Dean, and produced by Stargate and Sandy Vee for Perry's third studio album, Teenage Dream (2010). The song is a self-empowerment anthem with inspirational lyrics, and was considered by Perry as the most important song for her on Teenage Dream.\n\nPerry told Billboard that the inspiration for the song came from an unlikely source. \"My boyfriend showed me a paragraph out of Jack Kerouac's book On The Road, about people that are buzzing and fizzing and full of life and never say a commonplace thing. They shoot across the sky like a firework and make people go, 'Ahhh.'

We went out to this place called Wildcat and got crazy,\u201d Perry admitted: \u201cWe had a couple of beers and danced until we died, then brought the party back to the hotel room.\u201d She added: \u201cMost of that song is actual truth, apart from the m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois\u2026 unfortunately!

Written by Perry, Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Ammo, and produced by the last three, it was released as the album's third promotional single on August 17, 2010. The song was later announced as the album's fourth single and released on February 16, 2011. The single version features vocals by American rapper Kanye West, who also appears in its Floria Sigismondi-directed music video released on March 31, 2011.\n\nOver a \"stomp-stomp-clap\" beat similar to Queen's \"We Will Rock You\" (1977), \"E.T.\" is an electronic ballad that tells of \"falling in love with a foreigner\". Extraterrestrial metaphors are used throughout, and West continues these metaphors in his two verses, making heavy use of Auto-Tune at times. The song peaked at number one in the U.S., Canada, New Zealand and Poland as well as within the top five in Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom and the top twenty in ten other European countries.\n\n\nBackground\n\nThe decision to write \"E.T.\" came after its beat was accidentally played in the recording studio\u2014it was originally intended for American hip hop group Three 6 Mafia. Admiring its acoustics, Perry chose to work with the track, wishing to write a \"futuristic, alienistic song\". Following up to the release of Teenage Dream, \"E.T.\" was released as the third and final promotional single on August 17, 2010. In December 2010, Perry asked fans for their opinion on Teenage Dream's next single, through the social networking site Twitter. Speculation arose that \"Peacock\" would be its next single, but \"E.T.\" was eventually announced as the record's fourth single through her Facebook page. The announcement was accompanied by the single's artwork, which features Perry with cat eye make-up, bangs, and a sequined top. The single version features vocals from American rapper Kanye West and was released on February 16, 2011.\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n    * Ammo \u2013 composer, drums, keyboards, programming, producer\n    * Megan Dennis \u2013 production coordination\n    * Serban Ghenea \u2013 mixing\n    * Jon Hanes \u2013 mix engineer\n    * Sam Holland \u2013 engineer\n    * Dr. Luke \u2013 composer, drums, keyboards, programming, producer\n    * Max Martin \u2013 composer, drums, keyboards, programming, producer\n    * Katy Perry \u2013 composer, vocals\n    * Irene Richter \u2013 production coordination\n    * Tim Roberts \u2013 assistant mix engineer\n    * Vanessa Silberman \u2013 production coordination\n    * Emily Wright \u2013 engineer\n\nCredits adapted from Teenage Dream album liner notes. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Katy+Perry/_/E.T.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Its official release date is Monday, August 12, 2013, although the final version of the song leaked on August 10 and was played on the same day by a number of radio stations across the US.\n\nIt reached #1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart on September 5 and stayed at the top for a total of two weeks, becoming Perry's eighth #1 on the Hot 100. The music video for \"Roar\" was also released on September 5, 2013, which was directed by Grady Hall and Mark Kudsi.\n\n\"Roar\" also holds, as of 11/21/2010, the record for most spins on US Pop Radio, having a total of 17,176 spins on a single week across North-American radio stations. It topped music charts on nine countries, becoming one of Katy Perry's biggest hits.\n\nThe song is a bouncy statement by Perry of moving forward into the next stage of her life after the tumultuous end of her marriage to Russell Brand. Talking to BBC Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills, she revealed: \"It's a bit of a self-empowering type of song. I wrote it because I was sick of keeping all these feelings inside and not speaking up for myself, which caused a lot of resentment. Obviously I've been through a lot of therapy since my last record and that's what this is about.\"\n\nFour words that Sylvester Stallone came up with in the early '80s permeated pop culture through the decades, landing (in very derivative fashion) in this song. When Perry sings about having the \"eye of the tiger,\" it's a mantra of courage and determination that Stallone's character, Rocky Balboa, used in the 1982 movie Rocky III to defeat Mr. T's character Clubber Lang. Stallone saw the youth appeal in the phrase, and asked the band Survivor to write a song around the title. The first two Rocky movies were aimed at adults, but this third one, with a fresh, contemporary theme song, gained a whole new audience primed by MTV. \n\nPerry's use of the phrase goes with the big-cat theme of her song, and falls under fair use; the \"Eye Of The Tiger\" songwriters did not get writer's credits on \"Roar.\" This isn't the first time Perry has appropriated a distinctive hook line from a hit song - in 2010 she released \"California Gurls.\"\nSo what did Perry's boyfriend, John Mayer, think of the song? Mayer told Billboard magazine that he knew it would be a success. \"In a way you get swallowed up by it, it's so big,\" said the singer-songwriter, adding: \"Because it's such an incredibly big song that it doesn't need you to tell anybody, while you're eating lunch, [that] millions of people are going to be dancing on tables to that.\"\n\nThe song was criticized by some for sounding similar to Sara Bareilles' hit tune \"Brave.\" Bonnie McKee told Melony Torres on 102 JAMZ that any similarities were purely coincidental: \"A friend told me and I had never actually heard the song,\" she said. \"People also forget that we didn't write it yesterday. You know, the song was written months ago, before 'Brave' ever came out. There are only so many notes in an octave to work with, it's gonna happen\u2026 things are going to sound similar. But it was definitely just a coincidence.\"\nThe song's music video sees Perry in a tropical forest, much like Sheena, Queen of the Jungle. The clip was shot over three days by Grady Hall and Mark Kudsi and filmed at the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden. It co-stars actor and model Brian Nagel as her boyfriend, who meets an unfortunate end. Perry got to work with exotic animals while filming, but there was one clear favorite. \"Suzy the elephant cause she wouldn't stop eating everything!\" she tweeted.\nPerry was criticized by officials at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), for featuring exotic animals in the video. Merrilee Burke, a spokeswoman for PETA, claimed to the Daily Star that by simply having the animals on set, the singer and crew were exposing them to unnecessary stress. \"Animals used for entertainment endure horrific cruelty and suffer from extreme confinement and violent training methods,\" she said. \"They often become stressed and anxious when hauled around and forced into unfamiliar or frightening situations.\"\nA lyric video was released depicting Perry texting the lyrics of the song to her friends, while also substituting some words for emoji icons. Producer Dillon Francis accused the Californian singer of copying on her clip. Writing on Twitter, Francis said that the singer's visual ripped off the ideas used in the promo for his track \"Message,\" which also showed the lyrics being unveiled via text. However, Perry's clip also shows her doing mundane activities such as going to the bathroom and playing with her cat.\nPerry released a 30-second video teaser called \"Burning Baby Blue\" for Prism showing the singer lighting her famous blue wig on fire. The visual also revealed the August 12, 2013 release date for the song.\nThis won both Favorite Song and Favorite Music Video at the 2014 People's Choice Awards.\nThis is one of several one-word-titled songs co-penned by Bonnie McKee. (Others include Taio Cruz's \"Dynamite\", Kesha's \"C'Mon\" and her own single \"Sleepwalker\"). She told Billboard magazine that a single word is, \"clean, simple and bold -- especially if you find a really splashy one.\"\n\n\"I have a book of titles that I've compiled over the years, and I do find that one-word titles are special, probably because it means a simple hook and an even simpler concept,\" McKee continued. \"I know that when I do stumble upon a one-worder that pops, I'm psyched. If one word can sum it up, then the bones of the song are sturdy.\"\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Katy+Perry/_/Roar\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was Perry's first major label release, and was later placed on her major label album, One of the Boys. The song was released digitally as well as a 12\" EP. Capitol Records offered this song as a free download on her website. The song failed to enter the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nWhen asked about her debut single, Perry said the song was a \"soft hello\". The song \"wasn't meant to be a big single or show what the album is going to be all about. That was for my Internet bloggers, so I'm not coming out of nowhere.\" Perry's A&R Chris Anokute confirmed this by saying that they had no plans for radio coverage but just wanted to put this \"novelty\" song out online as an introduction to see \"what the attraction was\". As expected sales were low, but Anokute said the EP did well in terms of building a press story.\n\nFor the release of the single, Perry's label told her to include a cover. She originally wanted to cover a Queen song, but couldn't think of a particularly club-worthy song. While at a club with her friends, The Outfield's \"Your Love\" was played. Perry said that when the song came on, every girl in the place went onto the dance floor, and she wanted to have that same effect.\n\nPromotion and reception\nA female blond performer onstage wearing a white tuxedo and singing to a microphone in her left hand.

The song itself has been described as an \"emo-bashing anthem that's either horribly homophobic, a sly piece of social commentary or, possibly, both\".

It was selected as a promotional single from Prism after the singer asked fans to choose between this song or the dance club heavy \"Walking On Air.\"\n\nThe song features a verse from Juicy J. The Memphis rapper told RapFix Live host Sway Calloway about their collaboration: \"Dr. Luke gave me a call and was like, 'Hey man, Katy Perry wants you to feature on one of her songs for her album' and I was like, 'Wow.' I couldn't believe,\" he said. \"He sent me the track over, I did the verse and like a week later he called me again and he was like, 'She wants to meet you she wants you to come to the studio.'\"\n\nThe recording process was something new for the rapper. \"It was a little different. I did a lot of different versions to it. I recorded almost three verses because I wanted to make sure everything fit with the song and that she was satisfied,\" Juicy J said. \"So it was a little challenging to make, but I've been doing this for a long time and I had fun doing it so it wasn't a problem.\"\n\nDr. Luke also served as executive producer on Juicy J's Stay Trippy album.\nThe term \"Dark Horse\" is used to describe a person whose abilities or possible course of action are unknown, or to a somebody who reveals unsuspected talent. The earliest-known use of the phrase was in novelist and future Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli's 1831 novel The Young Duke: A Moral Tale Through Gay. He described a horse race where, \"a dark horse, which had never been thought of... rushed past the grandstand in sweeping triumph.\"\nUses of the term \"Dark Horse\" in popular music include a 1974 single, album and tour by George Harrison named after the phrase. The former Beatle also named his record label Dark Horse Records. In addition, Canadian rockers Nickelback gave their 2008 album the moniker of Dark Horse and Alternative rock band Switchfoot titled the first single off their 2011 Vice Verses \"Dark Horses.\"\nThis song was co-penned by Sarah Hudson, who is a singer-songwriter and a member of the Pop group Ultraviolet Sound. She isn't related to Katy (whose real name is Katy Hudson), however Sarah is the first cousin of another famous person with the same name, the actress Kate Hudson.\nPerry revealed at a special album release party with iHeartRadio that the song was inspired by the 1996 movie The Craft, which is, \"about warning a guy that if you're going to fall in love with me, make sure you're sure because if not, it's gonna be your last.\" The singer added that it reminded her of the moment she heard the Teenage Dream single \"E.T..\"\nThe song finds Perry playing seductress and putting a potential lover under her spell. She described the lyrics to MTV News as \"kind of witchy and dark, as if I was a witch warning this man not to fall in love with me, and if you do know I'm going to be your last.\" Perry went on to describe the tune as having a \"witchy, spell-y kind of black magic-y idea.\"\nAlong with Juicy J, Perry performed this song at the Grammy awards in 2014. She went with a witchcraft/enchanted forest theme, staging an elaborate spectacle where she emerged from a giant crystal ball and sang to an anthropomorphic horse. Those who believe in Illuminati found lots of evidence of Perry's involvement with the group in her performance.\nThe song hit the top of the Hot 100 after Perry performed it on the Grammy Awards on the previous Sunday. \"This #1 is the most unexpected one I've ever had,\" said the singer. \"'Dark Horse' has been a dark horse of a song, since August when the KatyCats voted to release it early on iTunes, before PRISM even came out.\"\nPerry enlisted Matthew Cullen to helm the video in which she plays a mystic queen in ancient Egypt. The pair previously worked together before, on her \"California Gurls\" clip. Juicy J also appears in the visual, emerging from a mummy's sarcophagus.\nMembers of the Muslim community criticized the video, citing the part around the 1:15 mark when Perry kills a a male subject, who is wearing a pendant that forms the word \"Allah,\" the Arabic word for God. The jewelry is also destroyed.\n\nFollowing a petition, which was signed by more than 65,000 people, the pendant was digitally removed from the scene.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Katy+Perry/_/Dark+Horse\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The dance-pop and pop rock song was written by Perry and Bonnie Mckee, while production and additional songwriting was done by Lukasz Gottwald and Max Martin. In late 2010, the entire demo of the song leaked online, with music critics comparing the song to Perry's previous single \"California Gurls\" (2010) and speculating that the lyrics are addressed to the singer's ex-boyfriend Travis McCoy. However, it is clear from a reworked version of the song, leaked on February 11, 2012, that the track is directed at her ex-husband Russell Brand with the lyrics \"Keep your diamond ring\".\n\nBackground\n\nThe track was written as part of the Teenage Dream sessions involving Perry, Dr. Luke, Bonnie Mckee, and Max Martin, along with \"Teenage Dream\", \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" & \"California Gurls\". Katy and Bonnie McKee had been casual friends before Katy called her because she wanted help on a song called \u201cPart of Me\". According to Rolling Stone magazine McKee stayed up all night writing lyrics. By the time Perry heard the third line, she shouted, \u201cWe\u2019re buying you a car!\u201d. In an interview with blogger Akex Kazemi, McKee said about the song: \"The other one I wrote on, 'Part of Me' I heard is gonna be on a bonus version or something. That one is beautiful. Katy sings with so much emotion and when I heard the chorus for the first time it gave me chills. It is a very real, raw song.\" On December 30, 2010, the full demo of the track leaked online. According to MTV.com the song was rumored to be a leftover cut from her Teenage Dream recording sessions. However, fans have speculated that the track may be included in a re-release of the Grammy-nominated LP, which was unconfirmed at that time.\n\nIn 2012, \"Part of Me\" received an official release as the lead single from the album's re-release. It will be available for digital download on February 21, 2012. On February 11, 2012, a day before the performance of new single on Grammy Award, final and complete version leaked on the internet with inclusion of new lines and changing the musical structure of music. On February 11, 2012, Capital Records announced Part Of Me would now be released on February 13, 2012\n\nAccording to James Dinh of MTV, the dance-pop, pop rock, and house song was produced \"by pop mastermind Dr. Luke\", and noted that \"the pop star appears strong, bold and just a tad resentful after a breakup\" on the track. The singer declares herself unbreakable after a breakup, singing about it in lines such as \"Days like this I want to drive away/ Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade/ 'Cause you chewed me up and spit me out/ Like I was poison in your mouth/ You took my light, you drink me down/ That was then and this is now, now look at me.\" Dinh also compared \"Part of Me\" to Perry's previous single \"California Gurls\" (2010), stating that \"the tune's steady beat amplifies\" as the chorus starts. \"This is the part of me/ That you're never gonna ever take away from me/ Throw your sticks in the stones/ Throw your palms in your clothes/ But you're not gonna break my soul/ This is the part of me that you're never gonna ever take away from me,\" she sings. Chris Ryan also of MTV speculated that the song is directed to Perry's ex-boyfriend Travis McCoy, while New York magazine journalist Amanda Dobbis considered it as \"another break-up anthem\".\n\n\nReleased \tFebruary 13, 2012\nGenre \tDance-pop, pop rock\nLength \t3:35\nLabel \tCapitol\nWriter(s) \tKaty Perry, Bonnie McKee, Lukasz Gottwald, Max Martin\nProducer \tDr. Luke, Max Martin <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Katy+Perry/_/Part+of+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It also became Perry's thirteenth Top 10 single on the Billboard Pop Songs chart.\n\n\"It's a love song and it's different from 'Roar' - it's not eighth-notey,\" said Perry. \"I think it's a universal love song that everyone's going to be able to relate to no matter the age, no matter male or female. It's my favorite song off the record.\"\n\nPerry spoke about the song's meaning during an interview with KIIS FM. She explained: \"Not only is it about those different varieties of loves, it's about when you are in love with someone and there's full acceptance. The highs and the lows. All the flaws. The zits. The smells. The whole gamet, you know? Sometimes I remember being scared to be accepted in relationships and I know that everybody else goes through that and, 'Will they love my true self? Will they love all the things that I do when nobody's looking?\"\n\nPerry added: \"You know because we are weirdoes. We pick our nose and we make disgusting noises with our body and we're not always the most presentable things but someone's gotta love us and it's about that unconditional love. It's about that high, almost spiritual type of love.\"\nPerry felt inspired to pen the song as a result of a visit to Madagascar with UNICEF. She decided to write lyrics about what it means to care for someone in the purest form. \"We live in such a world that is run by social status and material possession, and it can get really overwhelming and tiring to keep up with that - people are actually turned on by the amount of likes they have; it's crazy that our minds think that way these days,\" Perry explained.\n\n\"And so I went to the top of this mountain, I saw all these children, and the love that they had towards each other, they had no idea what Twitter or Facebook or any of that stuff was, they didn't care about it,\" she continued. \"It was this unconditional love between all of them. It was that kind of pure love that's unaffected by the trends of the world.\"\nPerry singled out this as her favorite Prism track as it passed the \"goose bump test.\" She explained to MTV News: \"There's this test that I do in the studio, after a song's complete and you've tracked some vocals. It's kind of like the goose bump test. If, every time you hear it, it gives you goose bumps, it's hitting a chord inside of you that's really important,. It's an emotional chord inside of you.\"\n\n\"I love this song because not only can it be a romantic, intimate song, but it can be about the type of love that a mother has when she sees her first child, or best friends or partners,\" Perry added. \"It's a transcendent love, it's not just relationship status.\"\nThe Brent Bonacorso directed video is centered around an elegant Renaissance-era ball. The clip explores the impact of love using dramatic imagery and was influenced by such films as Dangerous Liaisons and Anna Karenina. \"It doesn't have a complete narrative. I do that all the time; I usually have quite a big story line,\" Perry told MTV News. \"This time I wanted to give a lot of gorgeous, beautiful looks, which I don't usually go for. But it's mostly just a beautiful video that is supposed to evoke this power of love.\"\nBonacorso explained to MTV News how he attempted to capture the song's lyrical concepts in the video. \"When she sings this song she doesn't sing it lightly. This love that she speaks of is like a force of nature, epic storm and a tempest, and that's definitely something I wanted to capture,\" he said, adding that he wanted to capture a \"more mysterious, elegant and sophisticated world to live in... less about a time period and more about creating an impression and a feeling.\"\n\nThat \"feeling\" is expressed using various images, including a car crash, which is a visual metaphor for the power of true love. \"One of the key images that I think was pivotal in the video and just a very important concept to me. I once described the experience of falling in love like being hit by a car; suddenly your world is just so violently and dramatically changed. It hits you out of the blue,\" Bonacorso explained. \"I shared this with Katy and she really loved that concept and really identified with it immediately, that she felt the same way.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Katy+Perry/_/Unconditionally\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is the fourth single from PRISM album.\n\nThis upbeat jam finds Katy promising to give some lucky person the best birthday ever. The exuberant track was written by the singer in collaboration with Bonnie McKee, Henry Walter, Max Martin and Dr. Luke. The same team also penned Prism's lead single, \"Roar.\"\n\nKaty sings some of the song in a Mariah Carey-esque higher register. \"I wanted to do something that Mariah Carey would have put on her first record,\" Perry said while introducing the song during Prism's listening party.\n\nThe song's live brass is provided by the Saturday Night Live house band horn section, which gives us another Mariah Carey connection. The multi-octave songstress employed this same horn section for her performance of \"If It's Over\" during her 1992 MTV Unplugged special.\n\nThe song finds Perry seducing a lover with a bunch of sexual innuendos. Bonnie McKee told MTV News: \"The bridge actually the thing about the 'birthday suit' and the 'big balloons,' I was not in the room for that. I had no idea. I didn't hear it again until it had been mixed when I came in and listened to the bridge and I was like 'Katy, what did you do when I left the room?' It was really funny. I was laughing out loud.\"\n\nMusic video for the track was primarily recorded with hidden cameras, it features Perry disguised as five different characters in birthday parties and other celebrations. The visual attained mixed opinions from critics, who appreciated its theme but criticized her character portrayal. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Katy+Perry/_/Birthday\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Since the release of her 2007 debut single \"Ur So Gay\", Perry has released four albums - 2008's \"One of the Boys\", 2010's \"Teenage Dream\", 2013's \"Prism\", and 2017's \"Witness\".- and has had nine Billboard Hot 100 #1 hit singles.\n\nUnder the name Katy Hudson, she signed with Red Hill Records and released a self-titled gospel album in 2001, which was unsuccessful. She later recorded an album with production team The Matrix and completed the majority of a solo album from 2004\u201305, the later of which was never released. After signing with Capitol Music Group in 2007, her fourth record label in seven years, she adopted the stage name Katy Perry and released her first Internet single \"Ur So Gay\" that November, which garnered public attention but failed to chart. She rose to fame with the release of her second single \"I Kissed a Girl\" in 2008, which went on to top international charts. Perry's first mainstream studio album One of the Boys followed later that year and subsequently became the 33rd-best selling album worldwide of 2008. It was accredited platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America, while \"I Kissed a Girl\" and her second single \"Hot n Cold\" both received multi-platinum certifications.\n\nHer second studio album Teenage Dream was released in August 2010 and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The album includes five Billboard chart-toppers \"California Gurls\", \"Teenage Dream\", \"Firework\", and \"E.T.\" and \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\", making Teenage Dream only the second album - after Michael Jackson's Bad - to have five songs reach #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. With \"E.T.\" at number one on the chart of May 12, 2011, Perry became the first artist in history to spend 52 consecutive weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nPerry was credited as a guest judge on the seventh series of British television show The X Factor, has released a fragrance called \"Purr\", and voices Smurfette in the 2011 film The Smurfs. Perry had a long relationship with Travie McCoy; she married Russell Brand on October 23, 2010. After 14 months of marriage, Brand filed for divorce from Perry on December 30, 2011, in Los Angeles, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce became effective in July 2012.\n\nPrism is the fourth studio album by Perry. The album was released on October 18, 2013. Prism topped the US album charts with first week sales of 286,000 becoming Perry's best opening week to date <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Katy+Perry\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

(C) 2015 Interscope..."}, "description": "\"Hands to Myself\" is a song recorded by American singer Selena Gomez for her second studio album, Revival (2015). The track was written by Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, and its producers Mattman & Robin and Max Martin. It was inspired to add fresh, female perspective to the album and was influenced by the music of Prince. \"Hands to Myself\" is an upbeat dance-pop and synthpop song, backed by lightly clicking percussion, hand claps, a dark guitar riff and \"tribal pop\" synths. Gomez uses both her higher vocal register for belting, as well as her lower range breathy vocals in an octave just above a whisper. She clips her enunciation of the lyrics which detail a come-hither.\n\n\"Hands to Myself\" was serviced to contemporary hit radio in the US on January 26, 2016, as the third single from Revival. Music critics were complimentary about Gomez's versatile vocal performance and the track's uncharacteristic production and lyrics. Commercially, \"Hands to Myself\" has reached number seven on the US Billboard Hot 100, and the top 10 in Canada, New Zealand and Slovakia. It also managed to reach the top 20 in Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\nAn accompanying music video directed by Alek Keshishian was premiered as an Apple Music exclusive on December 21, 2015. The video depicts a film of Gomez dressed in lingerie playing a stalker of a Hollywood actor. Critics commended the video's cinematography and Gomez's appearance, hailing it as her sexiest and most revealing visual yet. Gomez promoted \"Hands to Myself\" with a televised performances on the 2015 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show and Saturday Night Live. The song has also been lip-synced to by the Victoria's Secret Angels in a promotional video, and used in Beats Electronics' commercial for their Beats Pill portable speaker. In 2016, the song was used in a television commercial for Pantene. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Selena+Gomez/_/Hands+to+Myself\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

With just\u00a0half a semester left of business school, breakout artist\u00a0DJ Vanic\u00a0did exactly that when he decided to pursue a full-time career in music. Without knowing exactly what it would lead to, the Vancouver based producer took a chance and boy did it pay off.&quot;Family and personal issues came up in my life that\u00a0made me re-evaluate my goals and direction,&quot; Vanic told\u00a0Forbes.com. &quot;I decided that I might as well spend my youth trying for something really cool and different, something I was passionate about. And music was the obvious choice, it&#39;s been one of the biggest parts of my life since I was 3 years old.&quot;\u00a0In as little as two years,\u00a0Vanic quickly made his mark. He took the festival circuit by storm and already managed to play the coveted\u00a0Coachella\u00a0music festival last year.\u00a0You&#39;re probably one of the millions of people who had his remix of Zella Day&#39;s hit single &quot;Hypnotic&quot; on repeat, which he dropped a few months ahead of his debut in the desert. Since then,\u00a0he&#39;s released originals of his own, including his latest track featuring Clara Mae &quot;Staring At the Sun,&quot;\u00a0which exudes the same high-energy as his live sets.\u00a0&quot;Clara sent over the vocal and I fell in love with it,&quot; he shared. &quot;The whole process took probably over a year though, because we kept changing the drop style and re-writing verses. As with any song I work on, it&#39;s the vocal itself that usually inspires me \u2014 whatever the singer makes me feel, I try to replicate that in the music.&quot;\u00a0\u00a0Though it appears his success happened overnight, that certainly wasn&#39;t the case. Vanic opened up\u00a0about how he&#39;s nowhere near where he wants to be skill wise and the importance of continuing to hustle.\u00a0&quot;I&#39;ve never claimed to be an amazing DJ,&quot; he humbly said. &quot;It&#39;s hard to keep creating music that is true to my own sound, but still unique and not repetitive. Though it&#39;s a challenge, I love the struggle behind it, otherwise I wouldn&#39;t be doing it.&quot;\u00a0A stepping stone that propelled his career was the moment\u00a0he signed onto Disruptor Records, the label headed by\u00a0The Chainsmokers&#39; manager, Adam Alpert. Vanic&#39;s own manager\u00a0Sebastian Barwinski (The Standard Group)\u00a0encouraged him to take that next step\u00a0and has backed Vanic\u00a0ever since he decided to make the move. &quot;\u00a0I have a really amazing team of people who help ensure everything in my life and business as Vanic falls into place,&quot; he revealed. &quot;Adam and Disruptor were the right fit. Everything they do seems to be spot on, and they&#39;re really good people to work with.&quot;\u00a0Up next, you can expect\u00a0way more new music from EDM&#39;s rising star. &quot;I have a couple remixes and a few more originals all being wrapped up,&quot; Vanic confirmed. &quot;I&#39;m hoping to release all of them throughout the summer and fall. Then I&#39;ll spend the rest of the time playing, traveling, DJ-ing, and hitting up festivals. After that we will be getting into another full headline tour across North America.&quot;\u00a0Vanic recently\u00a0played Houston&#39;s\u00a0Free Press Summer Fest\u00a0last\u00a0weekend and is scheduled to perform at\u00a0this weekend&#39;s Bonnaroo along with\u00a0Made in America later this year, where he&#39;ll be reunited with The Chainsmokers who are headlining the Philadelphia based event. However, I\u00a0have a feeling there&#39;s plenty more where that came from, this is hands down just the beginning.- FORBES\u00a0\u00a0", "title": "Vanic - Black Masquerade", "url": "http://anchorage.eventful.com/events/vanic-black-masquerade-/E0-001-110594666-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Williwaw", "date": "2018-03-02 21:00:00"}, {"city": "San Francisco", "description": " Join Us in a Celebration of SELENA, enjoy Musica Latina (The music of SELENA, plus the best in CUMBIA, SALSA, MERENGUE,\u00a0 y mas)\u00a0 hosted by Chuy Gomez Celebrity Dj&#39;s and Special Guest \u00a0FAQs Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event? 21 and up ONLY (no sports attire) Dress Code Enforced What&#39;s the refund policy?

Having appeared as a child in the children's television series Barney & Friends, Gomez rose to fame as the leading role in the Disney Channel series Wizards of Waverly Place (2007\u201312). Due to the success of the series, Gomez worked on various films, television shows, and musical collaborations for the network in the following years. Gomez also formed her own production company in 2008, titled July Moon Productions; she serves as an executive producer on the Netflix original series 13 Reasons Why, which released in March 2017. She signed a recording contract with Hollywood Records in 2008 and subsequently formed her band Selena Gomez & the Scene the following year. The band released three studio albums and produced four top 30 singles by 2011.\n\nGomez hoped to focus on her acting career by transitioning into film work, earning starring roles in films such as Ramona and Beezus (2010) and the romantic comedy Monte Carlo (2011). Gomez hoped to achieve a more mature image with a role in the exploitation film Spring Breakers (2013), as well as with the release of her solo debut album Stars Dance (2013). The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 in the United States, and included the top ten single \"Come & Get It\". Gomez embarked on her Stars Dance Tour (2013), though the later part was canceled due to her personal and medical struggles.\n\nIn 2014, Gomez fired her parents as her managers and signed with the WME and Brillstein companies. During this time, she signed a new recording contract with Interscope Records, releasing a compilation album as her fifth and final release through Hollywood Records, which was preceded by her second top ten single, \"The Heart Wants What It Wants\". Gomez released her second studio album, Revival, in October 2015. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, while the first three singles \"Good for You\", \"Same Old Love\" and, \"Hands to Myself\" all topped the Mainstream Top 40 chart in the United States. She embarked on her worldwide Revival Tour in 2016; like her previous tour, it was also cut short due to personal and medical struggles. Among music collaborations, she has worked with Charlie Puth on the song \"We Don't Talk Anymore\", and with Kygo on \"It Ain't Me\".\n\nOutside of entertainment, Gomez released her own clothing line through Kmart in 2010 and a self-titled fragrance in 2013. She has worked with various charitable organizations for years and became a UNICEF ambassador at the age of seventeen. Since the start of her career, Gomez has gone on to sell over 7 million albums and 22 million singles worldwide, according to Billboard. As of November 2016, Gomez is the most-followed Instagram user in the world. Gomez has earned a number of awards and nominations for her work as an actress and singer and has won an ALMA Award, a Billboard Women in Music award, an MTV Video Music Award, an American Music Award, a People's Choice Award, and fifteen Teen Choice Awards. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Selena+Gomez\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band members are Romy Madley Croft (vocals, lead guitar), Oliver Sim (vocals, bass guitar), and Jamie Smith, known as Jamie xx (beats, MPC sampler). Second guitarist and keyboardist Baria Qureshi was dropped from the band mid-tour in 2009. The reasons behind her ousting remain unclear.\n\nOn 17 August 2009, the group released their debut album xx on Young Turks label. The album was recorded in a small garage and produced by the band. It garnered critical acclaim and has been generally well-received, scoring an average of 86/100 based on 24 professional reviews. Also it ranked on \"best of the year\" lists with Rolling Stone placing it at #9 and NME placing it at #2.\n\nFour singles were released from their debut album: \"Crystalised\", \"Basic Space\", \"Islands\" and \"VCR\".\n\nThe xx also remixed the classic song \"You've Got The Love\" originally written by The Source and covered by Florence + the Machine. They also added their own vocals on the song. The group won the 2010 Mercury Prize for their album on 7th September 2010. After being the bookies' favourites for many of the weeks leading up to the announcement, they beat eleven other acts.\n\n\"Angels\" was the first single from The xx\u2019s second album, Coexist. It was released on July 16 2012. A second track from the album, \"Chained\", was released on line prior to the official Coexist launch on 11 September.\n\nIn June 2014, it was revealed in an interview with Dazed that the trio were working on their third studio album, with producer Rodaidh McDonald at the Marfa Recording Company studio in Marfa, Texas. Further writing and recording sessions were held in London, New York, Reykavik and Los Angeles.  The 2016 album 'I See You' title and tracklist, were revealed after untitled audio clips uploaded to Spotify were matched on Shazam. 'On Hold' was launched on November 10th.\n\nhttp://thexx.info\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+xx\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was composed by guitarist Jimmy Page and vocalist Robert Plant for the band's fourth studio album, Led Zeppelin IV. It is the most requested and most played song on FM radio stations in the United States, despite never having been released as a single there. In November 2007, through download sales promoting their recent Mothership release, the song hit #37 on the UK Singles Chart  and #13 on the New Zealand Singles Chart. It was voted #3 in 2000 by VH1 on their list of the 100 Greatest Rock Songs.\n\nAccording to music journalist Stephen Davis, although the song was released in 1971, it took until 1973 before the song's popularity ascended to truly \"anthemic\" status.\n\n\"Stairway to Heaven\" continues to top radio lists of the greatest rock songs, as well as topping a recent Guitar World poll. On the 20th anniversary of the original release of the song, it was announced via U.S. radio sources that the song had logged up an estimated 2,874,000 radio plays - back to back, that would run for 44 years solid. As of 2000, the song had been broadcast on radio over three million times. It is also the biggest-selling single piece of sheet music clocking up an average of 15,000 copies yearly. In total, over one million copies have been sold.\n\nThe song's length precluded its release in full form as a single. Despite pressure from Atlantic Records the band would not authorize the editing of the song for single release, making \"Stairway to Heaven\" one of the most well-known and popular rock songs never to have been released as a single. It did, however, appear as a promotional disc in the United States, pressed as a 7:55 track on each side; on an Australian acoustic EP, and in the 1990s as a 20th anniversary promo book.\n\nThe group's recording of this song also appeared as the sole Led Zeppelin track in the 1977 Atlantic Records 2-LP promotional sampler album, We've Got Your Music, marking the very first time that Led Zeppelin's \"Stairway To Heaven\" made its official debut appearance in an American-released various artists compilation collection.\n\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone magazine put it at number 31 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In in a January 29, 2009, article, Guitar World magazine rated Jimmy Page's guitar solo at number one in the publication's 100 Greatest Guitar Solos in Rock and Roll History.\n\nCritics of rock and roll songs (and of Led Zeppelin in particular) have alleged that a backmasked message is recorded into \"Stairway to Heaven.\" The message, which allegedly occurs during the middle section of the song (\"If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now...\"), is purported to contain Satanic references:\n\n    Oh here's to my sweet Satan.\n    The one whose little path would make me sad, whose power is Satan.\n    He will give those with him 666.\n    There was a little tool shed where he made us suffer, sad Satan.\n\n    \u2013 Most popular version of the lyrics to Stairway to Heaven played backwards\n\nThe controversy originated from a prominent Baptist, who, in 1982, preached on the radio that \"Stairway to Heaven\" contained subliminal backward messages. This theory was later primarily advanced by Michael Mills, Jacob Aranza, and Jeff Godwin, who offered detailed analyses asserting the existence of hidden meanings within both the \"backwards\" and actual lyrics. In 1982, the Consumer Protection and Toxic Materials Committee of the California State Assembly held a hearing on backmasking in popular music, during which \"Stairway to Heaven\" was played backwards. William Yarroll, a self-identified neuroscientist, also claimed that \"Stairway to Heaven\" contained a message when played backwards. Various versions of the alleged message exist.\n\nThe band itself has for the most part ignored such claims; for years the only comment came from Swan Song Records which issued the statement: \"Our turntables only play in one direction\u2014forwards\". Led Zeppelin audio engineer Eddie Kramer confirmed this, calling the allegations \"totally and utterly ridiculous. Why would they want to spend so much studio time doing something so dumb?\" Robert Plant expressed frustration with the accusations in an interview: \"To me it's very sad, because 'Stairway to Heaven' was written with every best intention, and as far as reversing tapes and putting messages on the end, that's not my idea of making music.\"\n\nAn informal experiment by scientist Simon Singh suggested that listeners only hear the message after prompting. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/_/Stairway+to+Heaven\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The hiss at the beginning of the track is feedback from an echo unit.\n\n\"Immigrant Song\" was written during Led Zeppelin's tour of Iceland, Bath and Germany in mid-1970. The opening date of this tour took place in Reykjavik, Iceland, which inspired Plant to write the song. As he explained:\n\u201c \tWe weren't being pompous ... We did come from the land of the ice and snow. We were guests of the Icelandic Government on a cultural mission. We were invited to play a concert in Reykjavik and the day before we arrived all the civil servants went on strike and the gig was going to be canceled. The university prepared a concert hall for us and it was phenomenal. The response from the kids was remarkable and we had a great time. \"Immigrant Song\" was about that trip and it was the opening track on the album that was intended to be incredibly different.\u201d\n\nJust six days after Led Zeppelin's appearance in Reykjavik, the band performed the song for the first time on stage during the Bath Festival.\n\nThe song is dedicated to the Icelander Leif Ericson, and is sung from the perspective of Vikings rowing west from Scandinavia in search of new lands. The lyrics make explicit reference to Viking conquests and the Old Norse religion (Fight the horde, sing and cry, Valhalla, I am coming!). In a 1970 radio interview, Plant jokingly recalled:\n        \u201cWe went to Iceland, and it made you think of Vikings and big ships... and John Bonham's stomach... and bang, there it was - Immigrant Song!\u201d\n\n\"Immigrant Song\" is one of Led Zeppelin's few single releases, having been released in November of 1970 by their record label, Atlantic Records, against the band's wishes. It reached #16 on the Billboard charts. Its B side, \"Hey Hey What Can I Do\", was otherwise unavailable before the release of the band's first boxed set in 1990. The single was also mistakenly released in Japan with \"Out on the Tiles\" as the B-side rather than \"Hey Hey What Can I Do.\" That single is now a rare collectible.\n\nOne of the lines from the song became part of Led Zeppelin lore. The line, \"The hammer of the gods/will drive our ships to new lands\" prompted some people to start referring to Led Zeppelin's sound as the \"Hammer of the Gods.\" The phrase was used as the title of Stephen Davis' famous biography of the band, Hammer of the Gods: The Led Zeppelin Saga. The lyrics also did much to inspire the classic Heavy metal myth, of mighty Viking-esque figures on an adventure, themes which have been adopted in the look and music of bands from Iron Maiden to Manowar.\n\n\"Immigrant Song\" was used to open Led Zeppelin concerts from 1970 to 1972. On the second half of their 1972 concert tour of the United States, it was introduced by a short piece of music known as \"LA Drone\", designed to heighten the sense of anticipation and expectation amongst the concert audience. By 1973, \"Immigrant Song\" was occasionally being used as an encore, but was then removed from their live set. Live versions of the song can be heard on the Led Zeppelin albums How The West Was Won (featuring a performance at Long Beach Arena in 1972) and the Led Zeppelin BBC Sessions (a version from the Paris Theatre in London in 1971). When played live, Page played a lengthy guitar solo, which was absent on the recorded Led Zeppelin III version. \"Immigrant Song\" was played as part of the 2009 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony for Jeff Beck by both Page and Beck. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/_/Immigrant+Song\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is featured as the opening track on the band's second album, Led Zeppelin II, and was released in the US (and Japan) as a single. The US release became their first hit single, it was certified Gold on 13 April 1970, when it sold one million copies. As with other Led Zeppelin songs, no single was released in the UK, but singles were released in Germany (where it reached number one), the Netherlands (where it reached number four), Belgium and France.\n\nIn 2004, the song was ranked number 75 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and in March 2005, Q magazine placed \"Whole Lotta Love\" at number three in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. It was placed 11 on a similar list by Rolling Stone. In 2009 it was named the third greatest hard rock song of all time by VH1. The guitar solo is ranked number 38. on Guitar World's \"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\".\n\n\"Whole Lotta Love\" was recorded at various studios in New York and Los Angeles during the band's second concert tour of the United States and assembled by Jimmy Page at Olympic Studios in London. Already part of their live repertoire, it saw its first official release on the LP Led Zeppelin II on 22 October 1969 (Atlantic LP #8236).\n\nThe song has been widely covered by many artists. It was famous in the United Kingdom for having been the theme music for the long-running television programme Top of the Pops during the 1970s and 1980s. It also featured in the closing ceremony of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing on 24 August 2008, in a rewritten version with Jimmy Page on guitar and Leona Lewis providing the vocals. Both Lewis and the organizers requested that some of the lyrics be changed, notably \"I'm gonna give you every inch of my love\". Lewis felt that the line made little sense coming from a female singer.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/_/Whole+Lotta+Love\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was written by Jimmy Page and Robert Plant (with contributions from John Bonham) over a period of three years, with the lyrics dating back to 1973.\n\n\"Kashmir\" is considered to be one of Led Zeppelin's most successful songs; all four band members have agreed that it is to date one of their best musical achievements.\n\nJohn Paul Jones suggested that it showcases all of the elements that made up the Led Zeppelin sound. During a television interview in January 2008, Plant named \"Kashmir\" as his first choice of all Led Zeppelin songs that he would perform, commenting \"I'm most proud of that one\".\nPage has indicated he thinks that the song is one of the band's best compositions.\n\nThe song centres around a signature chord progression guitar riff, which first appeared on Page's home-studio work tapes.\nIt was initially a tuning, an extension of a guitar-cycle that Page had been working on for years. \nThis was the same cycle that produced \"Black Mountain Side,\" \"White Summer\" and the unreleased track, \"Swan-song.\"\nAs bass player and keyboardist John Paul Jones had been late for the recording sessions, Page used the time to work on the riff with drummer John Bonham. \nThe two demoed it late in 1973.\nPlant later added the middle section and in early 1974 Jones added all the string parts.\nThe guitar was played in an alternative guitar tuning: the strings are tuned to 'Open Dsus4' or DADGAD. \nBonham's drums feature a phasing effect courtesy of an early Eventide phaser supplied by engineer Ron Nevison.\nPlant has stated that Bonham's drumming is the key to the song: \"It was what he didn't do that made it work\".\nThe song also includes many distinctive musical patterns of classical Moroccan, Indian and Middle Eastern music. \nOrchestral brass and strings with electric guitar and mellotron strings are used in the song. \nThis is one of the few Led Zeppelin songs to use outside musicians. \nSession players were brought in for the string and horn sections.\nAccording to Jones, \"the secret of successful keyboard string parts is to play only the parts that a real string section would play. \nThat is, one line for the First Violins, one line for Second Violins, one for Violas, one for Cellos, one for Basses. Some divided parts [two or more notes to a line] are allowed, but keep them to a minimum. Think melodically\".\n\nOriginally called \"Driving to Kashmir\", the lyrics to the song were written by Plant in 1973 while driving from Goulimine to Tantan in the Sahara Desert, Morocco, immediately after Led Zeppelin's 1973 US Tour.\nThis was despite the fact that the song is named for Kashmir, a region in the northernmost part of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nAs Plant explained to rock journalist Cameron Crowe:\n\u201c\tThe whole inspiration came from the fact that the road went on and on and on. It was a single-track road which neatly cut through the desert. Two miles to the East and West were ridges of sandrock. It basically looked like you were driving down a channel, this dilapidated road, and there was seemingly no end to it. 'Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face, stars to fill my dreams...' It's one of my favourites...that, 'All My Love' and 'In the Light' and two or three others really were the finest moments. But 'Kashmir' in particular. It was so positive, lyrically.\n\nIn an interview he gave to William S. Burroughs in 1975, Page mentioned that at the time the song was composed, none of the band members had even been to Kashmir.\n\nThe song runs for 8:28, a length that radio stations usually consider too long to play. However, upon its release radio stations had no problem playing \"Kashmir,\" especially after seeing \"Stairway to Heaven\", which was almost as long, do so well. (Original LP releases of Physical Graffiti incorrectly list the song's length as 9:41.)\n\n\"Kashmir\" was played live at almost every Led Zeppelin concert from its debut in 1975. One live version, from Led Zeppelin's performance at Knebworth in 1979, is featured on disc 2 of the Led Zeppelin DVD. \nThis performance came from the band's first show at the venue, on 4 August. \"Kashmir\" was also performed at Led Zeppelin's reunion show at the O2 Arena, London on December 10, 2007.\n\nLed Zeppelin expert Dave Lewis describes \"Kashmir\" as:\n\u201c\tUnquestionably the most startling and impressive track on Physical Graffiti, and arguably the most progressive and original track that Led Zeppelin ever recorded. 'Kashmir' went a long way towards establishing their credibility with otherwise sceptical rock critics. Many would regard this track as the finest example of the sheer majesty of Zeppelin's special chemistry.\n\nThe song was ranked the 140th greatest song of all time on Rolling stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time in 2004.\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ Led Zeppelin: The Definitive Biography by Ritchie Yorke\n^ a b c d e f g Liner notes by Cameron Crowe for The Complete Studio Recordings.\n^ Untitled Document\n^ Dave Schulps, Interview with Jimmy Page, Trouser Press, October 1977.\n^ a b c d e Dave Lewis (1994), The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin, Omnibus Press, ISBN 0-7119-3528-9.\n^ Guitar World, May 2005\n^ John Paul Jones' Mellotron\n^ Gilmore, Mikal (August 10, 2006). \"The Long Shadow of Led Zeppelin\".

This song and album became music history. It is still considered a huge cover hit by many people. In fact, most of the songs from Led Zeppelin's debut album are cover versions of other artists' material and not Zeppelin compositions.\nAccording to the Dazed and Confused Songfacts, it was inspired by an acoustic song that Jimmy Page heard folk singer Jake Holmes perform. \nHolmes' version was not about an acid trip, but contained many of the same elements that made their way into the Led Zeppelin version. \nSinger-songwriter Jake Holmes wrote and recorded \"Dazed and Confused\" for his debut solo album \"The Above Ground Sound\" of Jake Holmes, released in June 1967. Like the other tracks on the album, the song does not include any drums. It was recorded entirely with the trio of Holmes on guitar, keyboard, and vocals; Ted Irwin on guitar; and Rick Randle on bass. The song has been incorrectly labelled as a tale about a bad acid trip. Holmes has confirmed that is not the matter:\n\"I never took acid. I smoked grass and tripped on it, but I never took acid. I was afraid to take it. The song's about a girl who hasn't decided whether she wants to stay with me or not. It's pretty much one of those love songs.\"\nIn August 1967, Holmes opened for The Yardbirds at a Greenwich Village gig in New York. According to Holmes, \"That was the infamous moment of my life when Dazed and Confused fell into the hands of Jimmy Page.\" \nWhen \"Dazed and Confused\" appeared in Led Zeppelin's album in 1969, Holmes was aware of it but didn't follow up on it at that time. He said: \"In the early 1980s, I did write them a letter and I said basically: 'I understand it's a collaborative effort, but I think you should give me credit at least and some remuneration.' But they never contacted me.\"\nIn June 2010, Holmes brought suit against Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page for copyright infringement, claiming to have written and recorded \"Dazed and Confused\" two years before it appeared on Led Zeppelin's debut album. In court documents Holmes cited a 1967 copyright registration for \"Dazed and Confused\" which was renewed in 1995. This court case was \"dismissed with prejudice\", as the parties settled out of court in January 2012.\nIn concert, Led Zeppelin would play an extended version of this song which would sometimes run as long as 30 minutes. It was a showcase for the amazing guitar wizardry of Jimmy Page, and they never played it quite the same twice. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/_/Dazed+and+Confused\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Tolkien, author of The Lord of The Rings. The references are to the adventures of the Hobbit, Frodo Baggins, as he goes to \"the darkest depths of Mordor\" and encounters \"Gollum and the evil one.\" Plant later admitted in an audio documentary that he was embarrassed by the Tolkien references, as they don't make all that much sense - a fair maiden wouldn't be found in Mordor, and Gollum would want nothing to do with her anyway, since his only concern is the precious ring.\n\nThis is one of Led Zeppelin's most enduring songs, but they never performed it live from start to finish while the band was active. It was in their set when Zeppelin reunited for a one-off concert at the O2 Arena in London on December 10, 2007. John Bonham's son Jason filled in on drums at that show.\n\nWhat John Bonham played as percussion to supplement his drums on this song is not clear.

It was recorded by Joan Baez and released on her 1963 album Joan Baez in Concert, Part 1, and also by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, being included on their 1969 debut album Led Zeppelin.\n\nThe band was inspired to cover the song after hearing Baez's version. Both guitarist Jimmy Page and singer Robert Plant were big fans of Baez. Baez's original album had indicated that the song was a traditional number, and Led Zeppelin followed suit by crediting the song as \"Trad., arr. Page\". In the 1980s, Bredon was made aware of Led Zeppelin's version of the song. Since 1990 the Led Zeppelin version has been credited to Anne Bredon/Jimmy Page & Robert Plant, and Bredon received a substantial back-payment in royalties.\n\nThis was the number Page played to Plant at their first meeting together, which took place at Page's riverside home at Pangbourne in late July 1968. It is often stated that the song evolved when Plant played to Page the guitar arrangement which eventually found its way onto the album. In an interview he gave with Guitar World magazine in 1998, Page refuted this story, noting that he had worked out the arrangement long before he met Plant, told him he would like it on the album, and that Plant at that time did not even play the guitar.\n\nIt is rumoured that Page recorded another version of the song, with Steve Winwood, in 1968, which was never released.\n\nAt the 1:43 mark of Led Zeppelin's version of \"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\", it is possible to hear a very faint trace of Plant singing, \"I can hear it calling me\" just before he sings the same line in full volume. It is as if he \"hears it calling him.\" This \"ghost\" is the vocal bleed from Plant's scratch vocal, and it appears on the drum tracks, which were recorded live with the full band.\n\nThe band only played this song live at Led Zeppelin concerts on their 1969 concert tours, but Page and Plant brought it back for their 1998 reunion in a 9-minute version. When he played this song live, Page tended to use a fuzzbox. Led Zeppelin cite their best performance of the song to be at Copenhagen, Denmark, late 1968, during which Jimmy played the song with heavy fuzz.\n\nA live, filmed performance of \"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\", from Led Zeppelin's gig on Danmarks Radio at Gladsaxe, Denmark, on March 17, 1969, is featured on the Led Zeppelin DVD (2003). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/_/Babe+I%27m+Gonna+Leave+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was one of the first songs Jimmy Page and Robert Plant worked on together.\nThe pounding guitar riff was played by Page through a small, miked Supro amplifier throughout; and ran his Fender Telecaster through a fully closed Vox wah pedal to create the \"guitar in a shoebox\" sound on the lead. \"Communication Breakdown\" is also one of the few songs on which Page sang a backing vocal.\n\nFor more trivia and info on this song, check out the Communication Breakdown Songfacts. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/_/Communication+Breakdown\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was credited to all four members of the band, having been recorded at A&R Studios, New York, during the band's second concert tour of the United States, and was engineered by Eddie Kramer.\n\n\"Heartbreaker\" opens Side II of the album, and is famous for its memorable guitar riff by Jimmy Page, along with its unaccompanied solo, which he did not compose but rather improvised on the spot. It was voted as the 16th greatest guitar solo of all time by Guitar World magazine. It is included in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nPage's legendary guitar solo on this song inspired a young Eddie Van Halen to invent his \"tapping\" technique after he saw Led Zeppelin perform live at the Long Beach Arena in 1972.

The song is in reaction to the upheaval caused by the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. According to the When The Levee Breaks Songfacts, African-American plantation workers were forced to work on the levee at gunpoint, piling sandbags to save the neighboring towns. Hence the lyrics, \"I works on the levee, mama both night and day, I works so hard, to keep the water away.\" \n\nLed Zeppelin's version\n\u201cWhen the Levee Breaks\u201d \n \nAlbum Led Zeppelin IV \nReleased November 8, 1971 \nRecorded December 1970 \u2013 March 1971  \nLength 7:08 \nLabel Atlantic \nWriter Page/Plant/Jones/Bonham/Memphis Minnie \nProducer Jimmy Page \n \nRobert Plant of Led Zeppelin had the original McCoy and Minnie recording in his personal collection. He removed and rearranged lines and line parts from the original song and added new lyrical parts (again, the lyrics focused on the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927), and combined it with a revamped melody. Recording for the song took place in December 1970 at Headley Grange, where the band used the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. It had already been tried unsuccessfully by the band at Island Studios at the beginning of the recording sessions for their fourth album.[\r\n\r\nThe Led Zeppelin version features a distinctive pounding drum beat by John Bonham recorded in a three-story stairwell, driving guitars and a wailing harmonica, all presumably meant to symbolize the relentless storm that threatens to break the levee, backing a powerful vocal performance by Robert Plant. The vocals were processed differently on each verse, sometimes with phasing added.\n\nAccording to Page, the song's structure \"was a riff that I'd been working on, but Bonzo's drum sound really makes a difference on that point.\" The famous drum performance was recorded by engineer Andy Johns by placing Bonham and a new drumkit at the bottom of a stairwell at Headley Grange, and recording it using two Beyerdynamic M160 microphones at the top, giving the distinctive resonant but slightly muffled sound. Back in the Rolling Stones' mobile studio, Johns compressed the drum sound through two channels and added echo through guitarist Jimmy Page's Binson echo unit The performance was made on a brand new drum kit that had only just been delivered from the factory. The drum break has long been popular in hip hop and dance music circles for its \"heavy\" sound, and has been sampled for many tracks. At one time the remaining band members took legal action against Beastie Boys for their use of this drum sample on \"Rhymin & Stealin\" from Licensed to Ill.\n\nPage recorded Plant's harmonica part using the backward echo technique, putting the echo ahead of the sound when mixing, creating a distinct effect.\n\nThe song was recorded at a different tempo, then slowed down. Plant then sang in the sort-of-in-between key the song was now in (approximately F minor), which explains its sort of flat and sludgy sound, particularly on the harmonica and guitar solos. Because this song was heavily produced in the studio, it was difficult to recreate live. The band only played this song a few times in the early stages of their 1975 U.S. Tour.\n\nThis song was the only one on the album that was not remixed after a supposedly disastrous mixing job in the US (the rest of the tracks were mixed again in England). The original mixing done on this song was kept in its original form.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/_/When+the+Levee+Breaks\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is the first Led Zeppelin album composed of entirely original material. Houses..."}, "description": "\"Over the Hills and Far Away\" is the third track from Led Zeppelin's 1973 album Houses of the Holy.\n\nJimmy Page and Robert Plant originally constructed the song in 1970 at Bron-Yr-Aur, a small cottage in Wales where they stayed after completing a gruelling North American concert tour.\n\nPage plays a six-string acoustic guitar introduction with a melody reminiscent of \"White Summer\". Page repeats the theme with 12-string acoustic guitar in unison.\n\nPlant's vocals enter on the next repetition. He tenderly offers himself to the \"lady\" who's \"got the love [he] need(s).\" The acoustic guitars build in a crescendo toward the abrupt infusion of Page's electric guitars along with drummer John Bonham's and bass guitarist John Paul Jones' rhythm accompaniment.\n\nThrough the pre-verse interludes and instrumental bridge, \"Over the Hills and Far Away\" stands out as an example of Jones and Bonham's tight interplay. Following the final verse, the rhythm section fades out, gradually replaced by the echo returns from Page's electric guitar and a few chords played by Jones on harpsichord. In the final 8 bars, Page executes a linearly descending/ascending sequence and then concludes with the idiomatic V-I tag on pedal steel guitar.\n\nThe song was released as Houses of the Holy's first US single, reaching #51 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, later becoming a staple of the Classic rock radio format.\n\nSet lists from Led Zeppelin concerts frequently contained \"Over the Hills and Far Away\", the song being one that the band introduced on stage well ahead of its studio release. The group first played it during their 1972 concert tour of the United States and retained it consistently through 1979, before omitting it from their final tour of Europe in 1980. In singing the song live, Plant commonly followed the words \"pocket-full of gold\" with \"Acapulco Gold\" (a type of marijuana), as can be heard on the live album How the West Was Won. Also, at concerts guitarist Jimmy Page performed an extended guitar solo, which essentially consisted of the rhythm and lead guitar parts of the album version split into two separate pieces. This extended solo made the live renditions last almost or more than seven minutes.\n\nPlant had problems with singing the song live - he struggled to sing it at the Oxford show at the UK 1972/1973 tour and changed to melody of the song to a lower register on all the future tours.\n\nArchive footage of this track being performed live at Seattle in 1977 and at Knebworth in 1979 was used for an officially distributed video of the song, used to promote the 1990 Led Zeppelin Remasters release. The video accompanied a CD single which was released following the successful \"Travelling Riverside Blues\" release.\n\nThe song was first called \"Many, Many Times\", as shown on a picture of the original master on the Led Zeppelin website. Among blogging and forum-attending Led Zeppelin fans, the song has gained the abbreviation OTHAFA. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/_/Over+the+Hills+and+Far+Away\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

This was Plant's tribute to world music, reflecting his belief that music is universal.\n\nThe song was originally an instrumental  which was given the working title \"The Overture\", before Plant added lyrics to it, after which it temporarily came to be known as \"The Campaign\" before the band settled on the title \"The Song Remains the Same\". In an interview he gave to Guitar World magazine in 1993, Page discussed the song's construction:\n\n\"It was originally going to be an instrumental -- an overture that led into \"The Rain Song\". But I guess Robert had different ideas. You know, \"This is pretty good, Better get some lyrics--quick!\" [laughs]... I had all the beginning material together, and Robert suggested that we break down into half-time in the middle. After we figured out that we were going to break it down, the song came together in a day... I always had a cassette recorder around. That's how both \"The Song Remains The Same\" and \"Stairway\" came together -- from bits of taped ideas.\"\n\nPlant's vocal track was slightly sped up for the album release. Page played overdubs with a Telecaster on this recording, and also a Rickenbacker 12-string guitar.\n\nThe band first performed this song live on their 1972 Japanese Tour. Bootlegs from this tour reveal that the song was still without a settled title, with Plant introducing it as \"Zep\" from the stage at Tokyo. At Led Zeppelin concerts from late 1972 through 1975, \"The Song Remains the Same\" was followed (just as on the original album) by direct segue into \"The Rain Song\". For this live arrangement, Page employed his trademark Gibson EDS-1275 double-necked guitar. \"The Song Remains the Same\" would be the opening song for the 1977 US tour and 1979 concerts, before being dropped from the set list for the 1980 European tour. The song was also performed at Led Zeppelin's reunion show at the O2 Arena, London on 10 December 2007.\n\n\"The Song Remains the Same\" was featured on Led Zeppelin's 1976 concert film (and accompanying soundtrack), as part of lead singer Robert Plant's fantasy sequence. The title of the song was used as the title of both the film and the album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/_/The+Song+Remains+the+Same\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Studio sessions from this year reveal a very familiar \"No Quarter\", albeit a more aggressive time signature and drumming.  At it's album release in 1973 on \"House of The Holy\" it was recorded as a much more subdued, spacey song with a haunting synth melody.  \n\n\"No Quarter\" really took off on stage.  1973 saw the beginnings of a extended version (usually around 12 min)  with much more developed jam, and a very precise guitar solo from Page.  From this point on, Page also employed the use of his CryBaby Wah.  The Song Remains The Same Soundtrack features a version from July 28, 1973.  This version features an unusually tight performance and a spot on Page solo.  \n\nIn 1975 Led Zeppelin took \"No Quarter\" to a new level.  Giving the song ample time for improvisation (usually clocking in at around 20-25 minutes), it really grew to be a centerpiece for every concert from this point on.  Jones commands an impressive piano solo later taken over by Page, who takes on a more relaxed approach to his Dm Dorian solo.  \n\nEver allocating more time in their sets for \"No Quarter\", Led Zeppelin typically played upwards of 30 min of the song in 1977.  Most notably, Jones takes the piano in a new direction during his solo, further proving his multi-instrument mastery.\n\nIn 1979 the song was scaled back to 15 minutes and became a much tighter act. While still keeping the piano solo, it was cut back considerably from '77.  \n\n\"No Quarter\" got some more playtime with Page & Plant in 1994-5 and later in 1998.  Here, Page used a 12-string guitar in DADGAD tuning, and Plant used an echo/delay modulator to give the song it's haunting appeal without the help of Jones.  \n\nPlayed in 2007, at the O2 arena, the song returned to it's early 1973 length of ~10 min.  Here, Page tries more or less to replicate his solo from 28/7/1973.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/_/No+Quarter\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Led Zeppelin - Live at the Royal Albert Hall 1970),"}, "description": "\"Moby Dick\" is an instrumental tune and drum solo by English rock band Led Zeppelin, featured on their 1969 album Led Zeppelin II. It was also known by the alternate titles \"Pat's Delight\" and \"Over the Top\" during various points of the band's career.\n\nThe tune emerged after Jimmy Page would often catch Bonham jamming in the studio, recorded parts of it, and then pieced it all together. Only Page and bassist John Paul Jones play the tune's Drop-D blues-based riff with Bonham's drums\u2014as a power trio\u2014at the very beginning and the very end of the tune, leaving the remainder open for Bonham alone. The structure of the main riff is that of the twelve-bar blues.[citation needed] Singer Robert Plant did not sing at all, and in concert would simply introduce Bonham to the audience before the tune started. Studio outtakes from the Led Zeppelin II sessions reveal that the drum solo recorded was edited down from a much longer version.\n\nThe guitar riff can be traced back to the BBC unused session track \"The Girl I Love\" which was recorded in the Summer of 1969. It is an almost note for note copy of a riff which appears in Bobby Parker's 1961 single, \"Watch Your Step\". Jimmy Page was a fan of Parker's, and at one point in the 1970s attempted to sign him to Led Zeppelin's Swan Song Records label. John Lennon also admitted the same Parker riff had been a big influence on The Beatles' \"I Feel Fine\"[citation needed]. Page's riff was used as the theme to BBC2's Disco 2 rock show.\n\nBonham's drum solo was often played at Led Zeppelin concerts from the first American tour in November 1968, being his solo performance showcase on concert tours through 1977. Over this period it went through three different name changes. During their early 1968-1969 tours it was known as \"Pat's Delight\" (a reference to his wife), from 1969-1975 it was \"Moby Dick\", and during Led Zeppelin's 1977 US Tour it was \"Over the Top\" as the solo began with the opening riff to \"Out on the Tiles\" before segueing into a lengthy drum solo (in the same time ending with a \"Moby Dick\" riff). The last time \"Moby Dick\" was played by Led Zeppelin was on July 17, 1977 at the Seattle Kingdome, and can be found on various audio and video bootleg recordings.\n\nWhen played live, Bonham's drum solo would last as little as 6 minutes or, more frequently, as long as 20 minutes, while the rest of the band would leave the stage after having played the introduction. During the performance Bonham would often set aside or throw his drumsticks into the audience, and then continue the solo with his hands (sometimes drawing blood as a result); on occasion, the reason for continuing the solo with his hands was breaking his sticks due to ferocious playing.\n\nLive versions of \"Moby Dick\" are included on the live album How the West Was Won (lasting 19:20, performed at Long Beach Arena in 1972), and on Led Zeppelin's 1976 concert film, The Song Remains the Same as part of Bonham's fantasy sequence. It was also included on the film's accompanying soundtrack. The Led Zeppelin DVD also has a 15-minute long version that was performed and recorded at the Royal Albert Hall in 1970.\n\nJimmy Page remixed \"Moby Dick\" to flow seamlessly into \"Bonzo's Montreux\" on the Led Zeppelin Boxed Set, released in 1990.\n\nAn anti-littering campaign in the United States used the song for its theme music in the mid 1970s.\n\nThe song was referenced in the movies Dazed and Confused and Step Brothers.\n\nThe song is often played by Fred Norris as an introductory music track for female guests coming onto The Howard Stern Show.\n\nThe song was used as a double-entendre in the movie Step Brothers (\"Dick\" referring to male genitalia) when Brennan, Will Ferrell's character and one of the two title characters, played a snare drum on the other of the two title characters' (Dale, portrayed by John C. Reilly) drum kit. Brennan shouted as he performed this act, \"John Bonham's playin' Moby Dick for real!\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/_/Moby+Dick\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

According to various Led Zeppelin biographies, this is also the song that made Jimmy Page realise that Plant could now handle writing the majority of the lyrics for the band's songs. Plant wrote the song as a tribute to his then-wife Maureen.\nThe song features some delicate Hammond organ playing by John Paul Jones, which fades into a false ending before concluding with a crescendo roughly ten seconds later. This has created a problem for radio stations wishing to play the track, which must decide whether to accept the dead air or cut it off. Some stations run an edited version with the silence eliminated.[citation needed]\nFor the recording of this track, Page played on a Vox 12-string guitar.

This, along with the overall similarity between the sound of Led Zeppelin and that of Truth, led to a long rift between Beck and Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page.[1] Beck and Page had been friends for years at that point.[2] Interestingly, Led Zeppelin bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones had played the organ on Beck's version of the song as well, while still a session musician.\n\nIn an interview he gave in 1977, Page commented:\n\u201c \t[Led Zeppelin had] done our first LP ... with \u201cYou Shook Me\u201d, and then I heard [Beck had] done \u201cYou Shook Me\u201d ... I was terrified because I thought they\u2019d be the same. But I hadn\u2019t even known he\u2019d done it, and he hadn\u2019t known that we had.[3] \t\u201d\n\nIn another interview, also given by Page in 1977, he elaborated:\n\u201c \t[Beck] had the same sort of taste in music as I did. That's why you'll find on the early LPs we both did a song like \"You Shook Me.\" It was the type of thing we'd both played in bands. Someone told me he'd already recorded it after we'd already put it down on the first Zeppelin album. I thought, \"Oh dear, it's going to be identical,\" but it was nothing like it, fortunately. I just had no idea he'd done it. It was on Truth but I first heard it when I was in Miami after we'd recorded our version. It's a classic example of coming from the same area musically, of having a similar taste.[2] \t\u201d\n\nFor his part, Beck has said that he first heard that Page had recorded the same song was when Page himself played it to him:\n\u201c \tHe said, \"Listen to this. Listen to Bonzo, this guy called John Bonham that I've got.\" And so I said I would, and my heart just sank when I heard \"You Shook Me\". I looked at him and said \"Jim, what?\" and the tears were coming out with anger. I thought \"This is a piss-take, it's got to be.\" I mean, there's Truth still spinning on everybody's turntable, and this turkey's come out with another version. Oh boy ... then I realised it was serious, and he did have this heavyweight drummer, and I thought \"Here we go again\" - pipped at the post kind of thing.[4] \t\u201d\n\nOn the Led Zeppelin recording, Jones double tracked the organ and the electric piano. Page used his \"backward echo\" technique on this towards the end with Robert Plant's screaming vocals and the guitar. This production technique involved hearing the echo before the main sound instead of after it, achieved by turning the tape over and employing the echo on a spare track, then turning the tape back over again to get the echo preceding the signal. Page had originally developed the method when recording the single \"Ten Little Indians\" with The Yardbirds in 1967.[5]\n\n\"You Shook Me\" was one of the first Led Zeppelin songs to feature the call-and-response effect of blues style music, a style used frequently by the band on subsequent studio tracks and live in concert.[1] Jimmy Page uses a slide on this track and the song opens with a blues lick reminiscent to that of Elmore James. Perhaps because the song so effectively showcases the talents of all four band members, it was played frequently during early Led Zeppelin concerts. From 1973, however, the song was dropped from the band's live setlist as they began to incorporate more material from subsequent albums into their on-stage performances. (In fact, in its entirety the song was played until October 1969, and until 1973 it was from time to time added as a part of \"Whole Lotta Love\"). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/_/You+Shook+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band formed when Jimmy Page (guitar) recruited Robert Plant (vocals, harmonica), John Paul Jones (bass guitar, keyboards, mandolin), and John Bonham (drums). With their heavy, guitar-driven blues-rock sound, Led Zeppelin are regularly cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock music. However, the band's individualistic style drew from many sources and transcends any one genre. Led Zeppelin did not release songs from their albums as singles in the UK, as they preferred to develop the concept of \"album-oriented rock\".\n\nThirty years after disbanding following Bonham's death in 1980, the band continues to be held in high regard for their artistic achievements, commercial success, and broad influence. The band have sold over 200 million albums worldwide, including 111.5 million certified units in the United States, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. They have had all of their original studio albums reach the top ten of the Billboard album chart in the US, with six reaching the number one spot.\n\nShortly after their first tour, the group's eponymous first album was released on 12th January 1969. Its blend of blues and rock influences with distorted amplification made it one of the pivotal records in the evolution of heavy metal music. Although several of Led Zeppelin's earliest songs were based on or were cover versions of blues standards, others such as \"Communication Breakdown\" had a unique and distinctively heavy sound. Led Zeppelin also featured delicate acoustic guitar on \"Black Mountain Side\" in which the influence of Davy Graham can be heard, and a combination of acoustic and electric approaches on the reworked folk song \"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\". The immediate success of the first album kick-started the band's career, especially in the United States, where they would frequently tour. \n\nThe second record, simply titled Led Zeppelin II, followed in similar style later that year, and was an even greater success for the group, reaching the number-one chart position in both the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nJimmy Page and Robert Plant were blues fanatics; their first album included the Willie Dixon song \"You Shook Me\", and their later hit \"Whole Lotta Love\" was lyrically very similar to an earlier Dixon song. (The band were subsequently accused of using his lyrics without crediting Dixon, and it was not until Chess Records brought suit fifteen years later, that proper credit - and a monetary settlement - was given.) \n\nThe band also loved American rock and roll; the exuberant styles of Fats Domino and Little Richard were inspirations, and Led Zeppelin would perform rockabilly songs originally made famous by Elvis Presley and Eddie Cochran. Onstage, Led Zeppelin concerts could last more than three hours; expanded, improvised live versions of their song repertoire often incorporated tight workouts of James Brown, Stax, and Motown-influenced soul music and funk (favourites of bassist Jones and drummer Bonham).\n\nFor the writing of the music on their third album, Led Zeppelin III, the band retired to Bron-yr-Aur, a remote cottage in Wales. This resulted in a more acoustic sound (and a song \"Bron-yr-Aur Stomp\", misspellt as \"Bron-y-Aur Stomp\" on the album cover) strongly influenced by Celtic and folk music. Led Zeppelin III also ushered in an era of unique album jackets, this one featuring a wheel that displayed various images through cutouts in the main jacket sleeve when rotated. In November 1970 Led Zeppelin's record label, Atlantic Records, released \"Immigrant Song\" as a single against the band's wishes (Atlantic had earlier released an edited version of \"Whole Lotta Love\" which cut the 5:34 song to 3:10). It included their only B-side, \"Hey Hey What Can I Do\". Even though the band saw their albums as indivisible, whole listening experiences - and their manager, Peter Grant, maintained an aggressive pro-album stance - nine other singles were released without their consent. The group also resisted television appearances, which would have reduced their ability to control their presentation and sound quality. Lack of Zeppelin television exposure also enforced the band's preference that their fans hear and see them in person.\n\nTheir fourth album, Led Zeppelin IV was actually untitled, but is commonly referred to as Zoso, Runes, The Fourth Album, Sticks, Man with Sticks, or Four Symbols; it featured \"Stairway to Heaven\", which Jimmy Page performed on stage on a custom-built double-necked electric Gibson guitar, the top neck a twelve-stringed version.\n\nOver twenty-five years after disbanding in response to drummer John Bonham's tragic death in 1980, Led Zeppelin continue to be held in high regard for their artistic achievements, commercial success and influence.\n\nSince they disbanded, Page, Plant, and Jones have only played together on rare occasions. Page and Plant did get back together to record No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded as part of the MTV Unplugged series in 1994, which was accompanied by a worldwide tour, and again in 1998 for the studio album Walking Into Clarksdale. John Paul Jones also has performed since the break up - at the Bonnaroo music festival in Manchester, Tennessee. He was part of a \"SuperJam\" featuring himself on bass, Ben Harper on guitar, and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson on drums. He also played as a guest during the sets of various other artists throughout the weekend. \n\nMost recently Led Zeppelin have reformed (with Jason Bonham filling in on drums) for a one-off reunion concert in memory of Atlantic Records co-founder and executive Ahmet Erteg\u00fcn. After a postponement due to Jimmy Page fracturing one of his fingers, the group performed on 10th December 2007 at the O2 Arena, London. The concert was filmed for a potential DVD release.  Jimmy Page has hinted that the group may start work on new material, and that a world tour may be in the works.\n\n\nAwards and accolades\n\nLed Zeppelin were honoured by US President Barack Obama at the 2012 Kennedy Center Honors\nThroughout their career, Led Zeppelin have collected many honours and awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006. Among the band's awards are an American Music Award in 2005, and the Polar Music Prize in 2006. Led Zeppelin were the recipient of a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005, and four of their recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. They have been awarded five Diamond albums, as well as fourteen Multi-Platinum, four Platinum and one Gold album in the United States, while in the UK they have five Multi-Platinum, six Platinum, one Gold and four Silver albums. In addition to listing five of their albums among The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, Rolling Stone named Led Zeppelin the 14th-greatest artist of all time in 2004.\n\nPage was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in recognition of his charity work in 2005 and Plant was honoured as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to popular music in 2009. The band are ranked number one on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock and Classic Rock's \"50 best live acts of all time\". They were awarded an Ivor Novello Award for \"Outstanding Contribution to British Music\" in 1977, as well as a \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" at the 42nd Annual Ivor Novello awards ceremony in 1997.

At night we teamed up with the Palestinian students and stole tulips from Centennial Park. We used them as garnishes: we arranged bouquets on table ends and desktops.\nWe burned a wicker chair on the beach at night. We cooked steaks and pork chops on sticks over the fire. We went skinny-dipping. We huddled under the towels. We told stories about our fathers, about our first kiss, about that one uncle who was always drunk at family reunions.\nWe bought guitars and accordions and played them under blankets in the park. We tried to follow the Dutch dancers. We mowed lawns and stole flags from construction sites and kissed on the lips at the drinking fountain. We drank Boone\u2019s Sangria and cried and cried and cried on the couch.\nWe sewed shirts for our friends, with decorative borders made from ribbons, with zippers, with billowing collars, with floral patterns. Nothing fit right. We went around shirtless, even the skinny ones, even the fat ones, even the ones with terrific arms and shoulders.\nWe took our time talking things out; we listened carefully, with a serious look. We prayed. We read Paul\u2019s letter to the Corinthians. We tried very hard to understand this.\nWe went to a church that was in English and Spanish. We tried very hard to understand this.\nWe made omelets on the weekends. We whittled wood. We knitted hats. We smoked cigarettes. We gave each other gifts. Elaborate, handmade, complicated passive aggressive gifts.\nWe were afraid to be left behind. We were afraid to be loved. We were afraid this would come to an end, as all things do.

Mens \u00abThe Classic\u00bb fra 2014 var en sjelfull feiring av livet, stripper Wasser det helt ned til kjernen p\u00e5 det kommende albumet, og tar tekstene og lydbildet tilbake til anerkjente \u00abThe Survive\u00bb (2008) og debuten \u00abReal Life\u00bb (2006).

He is known for his lyrically focused and instrumentally rich songs that often relate to faith and family. He has enjoyed wide critical success in the United States. He is considered part of the folk revival through indie pop, but his influences are very broad, including experimental electronic music, the jazz of Vince Guaraldi, and the academic minimalism of Steve Reich and Philip Glass. \n\nThough Stevens had announced plans to make an album for each of the 50 U.S. states, beginning the series with the albums 'Michigan' (2003) and Come On Feel The Illinoise!' (2005, officially named just 'Illinois'), he has since then somewhat retracted the statement. \"Sufjan Stevens is not going to write a record for each of the 50 states after all\" was the original text included on the online liner notes for 'Mews Too: An Asthmatic Kitty Compilation' , a disc released on February 7, 2006. This statement was possibly included as a joke, as the text has since been removed and the current liner notes related to Sufjan Stevens reads: \"Sufjan Stevens can fold a fitted-sheet (he once worked as a professional folder in a commercial Laundromat).\" \n\nBackground\n\nStevens was born in Detroit, Michigan, and grew up in the city of Petoskey in that same state. He attended Hope College on the west coast of Michigan.\n\nThe name Sufjan is an Arabic/Persian name that predates Islam and most famously belonged to Abu Sufyan, a figure from early Islamic history. It has been mentioned in the press that the name was given to Stevens by the leader of Subud, a spiritual sect to which his parents belonged when he was born. Stevens has stated that the name is of Armenian origin and means \"comes with a sword,\" and that it is \"a charming militaristic Muslim name.\" In fact the name is not Armenian, and Armenia is a predominantly Christian country.\nSufjan is also the plural form of Sufi in Persian . Sufi is a practitioner of Sufism .This word is frequently used in the old Persian literature ,specially Sufi poetry .  \n\nHis brother, marathonist Marzuki Stevens, has trained to compete in the 2008 Olympic trials, and has played on two of Sufjan's albums.\n\nA multi-instrumentalist, Stevens plays the banjo, guitar, drums, and several other instruments, often playing all of these on his albums through the use of multi-tracking. While in school, he studied the oboe and English horn, which he also plays on his albums; he is one of the few musicians in popular music to use these instruments.\n\nCareer\n\nSufjan Stevens began his musical career as a member of Marzuki, a folk-rock band from Holland, Michigan. He also played (and continues to play) various instruments for Danielson Famile. While in school at Hope College, Stevens wrote and recorded his debut solo album, A Sun Came, which he released on Asthmatic Kitty Records, a record label he founded with his step-father in 1999. He later moved to New York City, where he was enrolled in a writing program at the New School for Social Research.\n\nWhile in New York, Stevens composed and recorded the music for his second album, Enjoy Your Rabbit, a song cycle based around the animals of the Chinese Zodiac that ventured into electronica.\n\nStevens followed this with the first of his 50 states albums, a collection of folk songs and instrumentals inspired by his home state of Michigan. The result, the expansive Michigan, included odes to cities including Detroit and Flint, the Upper Peninsula, and vacation areas such as Tahquamenon Falls. Melded into the scenic descriptions and characters are his own declarations of faith in God, sorrow, love and the regeneration of Michigan.\n\nFollowing the release of Michigan, Stevens compiled a collection of songs recorded previously into a side project, the Christian folk album Seven Swans, which was released in March 2004.\n\nNext he released the second in the 50 states projects, entitled Come On Feel The Illinoise!. Among the subjects explored on Come On Feel The Illinoise! are the cities of Chicago, Decatur and Jacksonville, the serial killer John Wayne Gacy, the poet Carl Sandburg, and Mississippi Palisades State Park.\n\nHe has contributed to the music of Denison Witmer, Soul Junk, Half-handed Cloud, Brother Danielson, Danielson Famile, Serena Maneesh, Castanets, and Liz Janes. He played piano on for fellow Brooklyn musician's The National's album 2007 Boxer. A cover of \"She Is\" is included on the album Dream Brother, released in the United States on January 31, 2006.\n\nSufjan contributed a lot to the sound of the 2001 Liz Janes album Done Gone Fire as he engineered, recorded, produced and arranged it as well as playing many addition instruments.\n\nSufjan recently recorded with Rosie Thomas and Denison Witmer playing banjo and providing vocals. It is unknown how this record will be released. In April 2006, Pitchfork erroneously announced that Stevens and Thomas were having a baby together, but were forced to print a retraction. Witmer and Thomas later admitted it was an April Fools' prank.\n\nThe Fifty States Project\n\nBeginning with Michigan, Stevens announced an intent to write an album for each of the 50 U.S. states, although in interviews he wavers between utter sincerity and self-deprecating irony when describing the idea.\n\nStevens spent the second half of 2004 researching and writing material for the second of these projects, this time focusing his efforts on Illinois. As with Michigan, Stevens used the state of Illinois as a leaping-off point for his more personal explorations of faith, family, love, and location. \n\nThe widely acclaimed Come On Feel The Illinoise! was the highest rated album of 2005 on the Metacritic review aggregator site, based on glowing reviews from Pitchfork, The Onion A/V Club, Spin, Billboard, Entertainment Weekly, Rolling Stone, The New York Times, and The Guardian. The 2006 PLUG Independent Music Awards awarded Stevens with the Album Of The Year, Best Album Art/Packaging, and Male Artist Of The Year. Pitchfork Media and Paste Magazine named Come On Feel The Illinoise! as the editors' choice for best album of 2005 and Stevens received the 2005 Pantheon prize, awarded to albums selling 500,000 copies or fewer, for Come On Feel The Illinoise!. In April of 2006, Stevens announced that 21 pieces of music he had culled from the Come On Feel The Illinoise! recording sessions would be incorporated into a new album, called The Avalanche. The album was released on July 11, 2006.\n\nThe next states to be taken on in the project have been reported as Oregon and Rhode Island. Minnesota may be another candidate; in late 2005 and early 2006 Stevens played a new instrumental track titled \"The Maple River.\" The Maple River mentioned in the title of the song runs through several counties in southern Minnesota. Sufjan also recorded \"The Lord God Bird\"\u2014a song about the ivory-billed woodpecker rediscovered in Arkansas (known as the 'lord god' or 'great god' bird because of its breathtaking appearance)\u2014in connection with a National Public Radio piece in which \"independent radio producers Dan Collison and Elizabeth Meister were curious about how Stevens writes his songs.\"\n\nReligious themes\n\nMany of Stevens' songs have religious and spiritual allusions, but his album Seven Swans has the most direct religious references. Stevens has expressed that he is Christian, but does not overtly advertise this aspect of himself in his music. Stevens has also stated that he does not try to make music \"with a message\", or music for the sake of preaching. \"I don't think music media is the real forum for theological discussions,\" says Stevens. \"I think I've said things and sung about things that probably weren't appropriate for this kind of forum. And I just feel like it's not my work or my place to be making claims and statements, because I often think it's misunderstood.\"\n\nThe songs 'Abraham', 'Seven Swans', 'To Be Alone With You', 'We Won't Need Legs To Stand' and 'The Transfiguration' directly address Christianity on the album Seven Swans. In 'Abraham', Sufjan recounts the Old Testament story in the Book of Genesis when Abraham, ordered by God as a test of faith, leads his son, Isaac, up a mountain and prepares to kill him, as commanded (but before God sends an angel to intervene). The lyrics of 'The Transfiguration' follow the Biblical accounts of Jesus' Transfiguration in Matthew 17:1-8, Mark 9: 1-8, and Luke 9:28-36.\n\nMichigan and Come On Feel The Illinoise! are packed with Christian references and metaphors. Michigan contains \"Sleeping Bear, Sault Saint Marie\", which implores \"Oh Lamb of God! Tell us Your perfect design and give us the rod\" (\"Lamb of God\" being a Biblical name for Jesus Christ). The song \"Oh God, Where Are You Now?\" asks God to \"hold me now\", to \"save somehow\", searching for God in the midst of personal turmoil. \"There's no other man who could save the dead,\" the song states. The album closer, 'Vito's Ordination Song', was apparently originally written for Sufjan's friend Vito Aiuto, and its lyrics allude directly to Psalm 139 (\"I always knew you. In your mother's arms, I have called your name\", \"I've made a crown for you\"). The song speaks of \"When the bridegroom comes\" - the New Testament speaks of Jesus Christ as being the Bridegroom and the Church His Bride, finally being united together at the End of Time.\n\nCome On Feel The Illinoise! features the song 'Chicago' with its refrain of \"You came to take us, to recreate us\", and 'Decatur' has the chorus of \"It's the great I Am\" (\"I Am\" being the name the Lord reveals Himself by to Moses in Exodus 3:14). \"Casimir Pulaski Day\" speaks of \"All the glory that the Lord has made\" in the midst of personal pain and loss. \"The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades Is Out To Get Us!\" has the lyrics: \"Lamb of God, we sound the horn. Hallelujah!\" One instrumental passage has the title of \"In This Temple as in the Hearts of Man for Whom He Saved the Earth\". \"The Seer's Tower\" speaks of Emanuel, \"With His sword, with His robe He comes dividing man from brothers\" (an interesting side note is that \"Sufjan\" actually means \"comes with a sword\"). Indeed, the vast majority of songs of Come On Feel The Illinoise! contain lyric lines which can be readily identified as having a basis in Stevens' faith in Christ.\n\nSufjan's second, electronic album, Enjoy Your Rabbit, contains a song cycle based on of the animals of the Chinese Zodiac, culminating with the song \"Year of our Lord\". Stevens released the original, Christian-themed song \"God'll Ne'er Let You Down\" on the \"To Spirit Back the Mews\" compilation on Asthmatic Kitty. The officially unreleased Christmas albums Sufjan Stevens made and then compiled into Songs for Christmas feature suitably Christmas and Christian themed music, both originals and covers of hymns and traditional songs.\n\nTrivia\n\nOn Snow Patrol's 2006 album Eyes Open there is a reference to Sufjan and the song \"Chicago\" in the song \"Hands Open\" - \"Put Sufjan Stevens on and we'll play your favorite song/\"Chicago\" bursts to life and your sweet smile remembers you.\"\n\nThe film \"Little Miss Sunshine\" featured pieces of two songs from Come on Feel the Illinoise in its soundtrack.\n\nSufjan has twice been featured on the FOX television show \"The OC\". \"To Be Alone With You\" and \"For The Widows In Paradise, For The Fatherless In Ypsilanti\" can be heard on episodes 202 and 315, respectively.\n\nSufjan Stevens' music has appeared twice on the Showtime dark comedy \"Weeds\". \"All The Trees Of The Field Will Clap Their Hands\" appears on S1E02 over the end credits, and \"Holland\" appears near the end of S2E10.\n\nTwo of Sufjan's songs appear on the soundtrack to \"Little Miss Sunshine\": \"Chicago\" and \"No Man's Land\"\n\nThe song \"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\" appears on the 3rd season of the tv show \"Nip/Tuck\".\n\n Several song can be heard on the movie \"Driving Lessons\"\n\nYou can also hear snippets in between CSI shows on 5US\n\nIn the TV show \"Austin City Limits\", he mentioned that when he was a kid, he and his best friend saw something in the sky which they couldn't figure out. They thought it was a spaceship or UFO first, then an eagle or a dragon. Finally they realized it was a giant wasp. He wrote the song \"The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades is Out to Get Us!\" about the incident and mentioned that the reason they (the band) all have wings on stage is to overcome his fear of flying things.\n\nThe song \"Redford (For Yia-Yia & Pappou)\" is heard in the 2012 \"World of Red Bull\" television commercial. he is quoted as saying \"selling out never looked so good.\" and \"somebody had to pay for all of that Christmas confetti.\" referring to his recent Christmas album and supporting tour. \n\nWebsite:http://sufjan.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sufjan+Stevens\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Man is an experimental indie rock four-piece centered on frontman John Baldwin Gourley\u2019s abstract musical approach and corresponding upbringing. He was raised in a sort of technological isolation: his log cabin home in the winter wasteland of the fringes of Wasilla, Alaska was powered by a generator and had no telephone. Both of his parents helped completely immerse him in the unique lifestyle that comes with a land of seasonal darkness and perpetual cold with their jobs as dog sled mushers. Gourley\u2019s innate curiosity and individual spirit combined with a fascination with science fiction and experiences of homelessness create a distinctly transcendent sound that is always open to interpretation and change. \n\nEven though members were born in Alaska, the band formed in Portland, Oregon, USA, in 2004 with the union of Gourley (vocals, guitar, organ, machines) and his childhood friend Zachary Scott Carothers (Bass, percussion, vocals) after the break-up of their band Anatomy Of A Ghost. Jason Sechrist (Drums and Gang) of Portland, OR joined in 2005. Current lineup includes Ryan Neighbors (Piano, Rhodes, Organ, Synth, Vocals). They are however known for fluidity in both their music and their lineup and often feature guest appearances.\n\nThe band\u2019s debut album, Waiter: \u201cYou Vultures!\u201d was released by Fearless Records on January 24th, 2006.\n\nOn June 22, 2007 they released their second full length, Church Mouth. The band then set out on a full US tour with support from The Photo Atlas, Play Radio Play, Tera Melos, and The Only Children. They then toured Europe, and followed it up with another US headlining tour with support from Rocky Votolato and Great Depression during September and October. Following this tour, they joined Thursday on a short east coast tour in November alongside Circle Takes the Square.\n\nPortugal. The Man collaborated with the band The Sound of Animals Fighting on the re-release of their first album, \u201cTiger and the Duke.\u201d Portugal. The Man remixed three of the songs on that album.\n\nOn July 30, 2008, it was announced that Portugal. The Man would release Censored Colors under its independent record label, Approaching AIRballoons, with a partnership with EQUAL VISION RECORDS. The album was released September 16, 2008.\n\nOn April 9th, 2009, Portugal. The Man announced a fourth studio album, The Satanic Satanist. It was released on July 21, 2009.\n\nAs of October 2009, It was announced through Twitter that Portugal. The Man have completed another album entitled \u201cAmerican Ghetto\u201d which combines their progressive rock style from their latter albums with some of the electo style from their \u201cIts Complicated Being A Wizard\u201d release. A listening party was held for a group of 17 fans in Los Angeles CA. The album was released on March 2, 2010. \n\nThe Got it All (This Can\u2019t Be Living Now) Songfacts reports the band\u2019s sixth album and first for Atlantic, In the Mountain in the Cloud, was released on July 19, 2011.\n\nIt was last spring 2012, and John Gourley\u2014frontman of Portugal. The Man\u2014found himself in New York City about to ring the bell at Danger Mouse\u2019s apartment--a long way from his current home in Portland, and farther still from his real home in Alaska. Six full-length albums in six years, nonstop touring, a stint with The Black Keys and festival stops at Coachella, Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza\u2014up until this moment, Portugal. The Man embodied all dimensions of DIY rock range. \n\nWhen it came time to begin work on the seventh album, Gourley thought long and hard about the next move and kept coming back to one concept: The most satisfying work is collaborative work. From building houses with his father in Alaska to building a devoted fanbase, he had sought partnerships. So he took a bold step \u2014 bold for a proven band, bolder still for its uncertainty of sound \u2014 a step up to the apartment of a possible collaborator, Danger Mouse.\n\n\u201cI walked into his place,\u201d Gourley remembers now. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t going to happen. He was like, \u2018Hey, man, just so you know, I don\u2019t really want to record a rock band.\u2019 And I was a little relieved. We\u2019d done this by ourselves before, and we knew we could do it by ourselves again.\u201d\n\nBut then they got to listening, and to talking about how much Danger Mouse had loved In the Mountain in the Cloud \u2014 the 2011 followup to Portugal. The Man\u2019s break out record The Satanic Satanist. \u201cFrom that very first meeting,\u201d says Danger Mouse, \u201cwe were very ambitious about what we could do\u2026otherwise there was no point. So we decided: Let\u2019s try and make something really special.\u201d\n\nSo Danger Mouse \u2014 aka Brian Burton, the five-time Grammy award winning producer behind everything from Gnarls Barkley and Beck to  The Black Keys  and now U2 \u2014and the band agreed that they were game for the challenge and began production on what would become Evil Friends, the undaunted re-awakening for Portugal. The Man. As much as their collaborative imaginations melded, to construct songs that lived up to the ambitious visions they had would take some time. After all, here was a band with an evolving lineup \u2014 Kyle O\u2019Quin on keyboards, Noah Gersh on guitar/percussion/keyboards, and Kane Ritchotte on drums joined Zach Carothers on bass and vocals and Gourley on lead vocals and guitar \u2014 building new songs with a new producer trying to do something neither of them had done before.\n\nThey went, together, to Los Angeles and worked through several sessions \u2014 at Mondo Studios, Eltro Vox Studios, and Kingsize Soundlabs. The band worked months longer than they ever had on one thing. And somehow \u2014 maybe it was the collaboration in the air, or maybe sheer will \u2014 they finally stopped searching and started realizing: \u201cWhat really brought our record together was getting past that period of looking for something, and figuring out how to do something really new, really hard, and really satisfying,\u201d said Gourley.\n\nEach track on Evil Friends is as different from the next as Portugal. The Man\u2019s previous records were from each other, which is to say a piece of a growing mindscape, and wholly a part of the group\u2019s tumbling fever dream. Where the 2009 hit People Say  was a cheery guitar rally, the new title track is a bells-and-balls ballad emerging from darkness into a pipe-whistling punky thump, albeit with Gourley\u2019s trademark falsetto and thundering guitar. And yet here is Evil Friends swirling, like a tornado that sends a napping child toward Oz, into something of a tale of Portugal. The Man\u2019s arousal from when it decided to make something special to when it actually did: The weighted down questions of \u201cPlastic Soldiers\u201d (Could it be we got lost in the summer? / Well I know you know that it\u2019s over) give way to the confident melodies of \u201cModern Jesus\u201d (The only rule we need is never giving up / The only faith we have is faith in us) and finally, brazenly, to the anthem \u201cSmile\u201d (We watched the sun come up / But took it down to hide it / Seems like the spring has come and gone / It felt like forever).\n\nIt took all year, and Portugal. The Man \u2014 a group guaranteed for seven years to pump out a record, to tour and tour and tour, to tuck its fans to bed at night with a community of psychedelic rock \u2014 had learned to slow down and transform all-day, all-night recording with Danger Mouse into adrenaline, into words that are at once dark and light, into sounds that are overlapping with danger and charm. The whole \u201cevil friends\u201d thing was just a happy writing accident, by the way, a lyrical coincidence belying a collaborative friendship Burton says taught him, too: \u201cI felt like I was watching them do something special and I wanted to let them do it, so sometimes I was more hands-on, but sometimes more hands-off than I had been with anyone,\u201d says Danger Mouse. \u201cThey had done enough albums that I thought it would be fun to shake it up a little bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the beginning, I asked Brian why he had wanted to talk about making a record,\u201d recalls Gourley. \u201cAnd he admitted that he was surprised when he saw us live. \u2018I didn\u2019t know you guys could sound like that.\u2019 There had been this perception that we\u2019ve been something else \u2014 and I\u2019ve noticed it, at festivals, everywhere \u2014 that we were something we were not. But then we got in a room with Danger Mouse, to the place where we could just throw that out, wake up and say, Here we are. We\u2019re this band! Let\u2019s just make it, together.\u201d\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Portugal.+The+Man\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

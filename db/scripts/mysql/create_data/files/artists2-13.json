It was around 2004 that Jens Moelle and Ismail Isi Tuefeki met at a Hamburg record store. Isi was a shopper at Underground Solution, a haven for specialist electronica, and Jens worked there in the afternoons. Before an in-store party, a DJ was taken ill. The owner asked Isi to pair up with Jens to play. He didnt know it, but the friends had already begun producing their own material. Originally, it was just about fun. They made songs to fill holes in their sets - if they couldnt find the right track, theyd make it. The duos ambitions were humble. So when their edit of The White Stripes Seven Nation Army was released as a limited run, it was a big moment. It sold out instantly. Thats when they moved into the bunker studio in Hamburg they still work in today. The waves they were creating were soon being felt outside Hamburgs dance scene. Specifically, catching the attention of Parisian label Kitsun, run by Gildas Loac and Masaya Kuroki. Isi remembers, a colleague received a text from Gildas. All the people in Paris right now, theyre on the tables going crazy, it said. I want this record! He was talking about Digitalism. Soon they joined the Kitsun family - a label responsible for so much of that eras defining electronic music, blurring lines between garage-rock and electro. This was a new sound thrilling festival crowds and mutating the traditional indie-disco dance-floor playlists. Digitalism summed up this eclecticism, this energy. But they werent alone. Klaxons, Simian Mobile Disco, Justice and LCD Soundsystem - these artists were live bands, DJs, they released compilations, albums, mixes. The rules of the traditional linear band didnt apply. There was something sizzling there, says Jens. It was a very united moment.At the centre of this all was Pogo, Digitalisms anthemic breakout single, and just after that, Idealism their debut album in 2007 (It sounded very ambitious and pretty raw, says Jens). It gave birth to huge tracks Zdarlight, I Want I Want and Digitalism In Cairo. What followed wasnt just a massive world tour, but a succession of surreal moments. All of a sudden, youre playing with Daft Punk or Soulwax!Album two I Love You Dude, released in 2011, was a deliberate bid to do something new. It involved more songwriting, vocal recording and production. A bit more sober, remembers Jens. A period of recuperation followed, before unleashing third album Mirage in 2016, a deliberate move to recapture the seismic scale of their debut. We wanted to go back into space. Go big again, smiles Jens. It was almost like a prog-rock album.Now, its time to reinvent again. Back in Hamburg, theyve gathered material for a new EP. Their first entirely instrumental release, it expands with the sounds of Mariachi horns and marching rhythms. It is, Jens says, only the tip of the iceberg.So, some things change: the band have lived through the changing ways people listen to music, the inevitable evolution of scenes - and, sadly, the record store isnt there anymore.

DIGITALISM Website Soundcloud The story of Digitalism is about the things that change, and the things that don\u2019t. It was around 2004 that Jens Moelle and Ismail \u201cIsi\u201d Tuefek\u00e7i met at a Hamburg record store. Isi was a shopper at Underground Solution, a haven for specialist electronica, and Jens worked there in the afternoons. Before an in-store party, a DJ was taken ill. The owner asked Isi to pair up with Jens to play. He didn\u2019t know it, but the friends had already begun producing their own material. Originally, it was just about fun. They made songs to fill holes in their sets - if they couldn\u2019t find the right track, they\u2019d make it. The duo\u2019s ambitions were humble. So when their edit of The White Stripes\u2019 \u2018Seven Nation Army\u2019 was released as a limited run, it was a big moment. It sold out instantly. \u00a0 That\u2019s when they moved into the \u201cbunker\u201d studio in Hamburg they still work in today. The waves they were creating were soon being felt outside Hamburg\u2019s dance scene. Specifically, catching the attention of Parisian label Kitsun\u00e9, run by Gildas Loa\u00ebc and Masaya Kuroki. Isi remembers, a colleague received a text from Gildas. \u201cAll the people in Paris right now, they\u2019re on the tables going crazy,\u201d it said. \u201cI want this record!\u201d He was talking about Digitalism. Soon they joined the Kitsun\u00e9 family - a label responsible for so much of that era\u2019s defining electronic music, blurring lines between garage-rock and electro. This was a new sound thrilling festival crowds and mutating the traditional indie-disco dance-floor playlists. Digitalism summed up this eclecticism, this energy. But they weren\u2019t alone. Klaxons, Simian Mobile Disco, Justice and LCD Soundsystem - these artists were live bands, DJs, they released compilations, albums, mixes. The rules of the traditional linear band didn\u2019t apply. \u201cThere was something sizzling there,\u201d says Jens. \u201cIt was a very united moment.\u201d At the centre of this all was \u2018Pogo\u2019, Digitalism\u2019s anthemic breakout single, and just after that, \u2018Idealism\u2019 their debut album in 2007 (\u201cIt sounded very ambitious and pretty raw,\u201d says Jens). It gave birth to huge tracks \u2018Zdarlight\u2019, \u2018I Want I Want\u2019 and \u2018Digitalism In Cairo\u2019. What followed wasn\u2019t just a massive world tour, but a succession of surreal moments. \u201cAll of a sudden, you\u2019re playing with Daft Punk or Soulwax!\u201d Album two \u2018I Love You Dude\u2019, released in 2011, was a deliberate bid to do something new. \u201cIt involved more songwriting, vocal recording and production. A bit more sober,\u201d remembers Jens. A period of recuperation followed, before unleashing third album \u2018Mirage\u2019 in 2016, a deliberate move to recapture the seismic scale of their debut. \u201cWe wanted to go back into space. Go big again,\u201d smiles Jens. \u201cIt was almost like a prog-rock album.\u201d Now, it\u2019s time to reinvent again. Back in Hamburg, they\u2019ve gathered material for a new EP. Their first entirely instrumental release, it expands with the sounds of Mariachi horns and marching rhythms. It is, Jens says, \u201conly the tip of the iceberg\u201d. So, some things change: the band have lived through the changing ways people listen to music, the inevitable evolution of scenes - and, sadly, the record store isn\u2019t there anymore. But other things don\u2019t: namely, Isi and Jens\u2019 enduring friendship (their \u201cmusic marriage\u201d), the special feel of the \u201cbunker\u201d they call home and their motivation not to follow trends but make music they want to hear.

Having a song included in the book has been described \"the ultimate insider credential for a jazz composer\".\n\nThe song is used as instrumental background music on the BBC London radio programme presented by Danny Baker. It was also the theme tune for the early 1970s BBC2 show \"One man's week\".\n\nA cover of the piece recorded by Zappa Plays Zappa (including Zappa's son Dweezil and former Zappa alumni Steve Vai and Napoleon Murphy Brock) won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in February 2009. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Zappa/_/Peaches+en+Regalia\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was inevitable that from the moment of his birth his life would be filled wall-to wall with music (his father having listed his religion as &quot;musician&quot; on Dweezil&#39;s birth certificate). Dweezil&#39;s early years were spent largely away from the spotlightsomething of a rarity for the child of a celebrity, but perfect for cultivating a close relationship with his family.Having watched his father perform concerts from the side of the stage since he was in diapers it was no surprise that he began to show an interest in music early on. At 6 years old he received his first guitar, a Fender Music Master from his dad. It wasn&#39;t until he was 12 that he began to show a serious interest in manipulating the instrument to make music.Having primarily heard the music his father was working on or listening to at home while growing up, Dweezil soon found himself exposed to some new sounds on the radio. Besides his father&#39;s music he began listening to the Beatles, Queen, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, The Who and Jimi Hendrix. Like many aspiring guitarists of his generation, Dweezil &#39;s ear was caught in a stranglehold by the trailblazing guitar styles of Edward Van Halen and Randy Rhoads. He listened to their records for hours on end trying to figure out a way to translate what he was hearing in his head to his fingers at the other end of the guitar. Along the way, he had opportunities to ask his dad for some help. &quot;I remember asking Frank to help me figure out the song &#39;Revelation/Mother Earth&#39; from Blizzard Of Oz. I really didn&#39;t know anything about chords and in that song Randy Rhoads was using classical music elements that were really new to rock guitar at the time. Frank helped me learn the finger picking intro.&quot; To gain more fundamental knowledge of technique and scales Dweezil was fortunate to have some assistance from one of the musicians in his father&#39;s band at that time, Steve Vai. Dweezil became remarkably proficient in a very short amount of time due to his intense practicing sessions.&quot;Steve made a notebook, which I still have, of scales and exercises and I practiced the stuff from that book at least 5 hours a day.&quot; In 1982, at the age of 12 he made his first onstage appearance with his father&#39;s band at the Hammersmith Odeon in London. &quot;That was a great experience. I was so excited to have been asked to play but I was incredibly nervous. Since I could only really play lead in the key of A, Frank devised a hand signal for the band to modulate the song &#39;Stevie&#39;s Spanking&#39; down to A from it&#39;s original key of B. After I finished my solo he gave the cue for the band to modulate back up. It was so cool how he had so much control over the music, it almost seemed like a magic trick to me. It made a big impression on me and has stuck with me my whole life.&quot;Later that year he recorded his first single, &quot;My Mother Is A Space Cadet&quot;, released on Frank Zappa&#39;s Barking Pumpkin label. The amazing story behind that recording is that it was produced by Edward Van Halen. (On the sleeve it is credited as being produced by De Vards in order to avoid any contractual issues for Van Halen.)&quot;There are no words to describe how inspirational it was for me to be able to work with Edward on that recording. I was 12, a novice player and in complete awe of his super human accomplishments. I had a terrible sense of rhythm and he tried really hard to help me with that. I had only been playing for around 9 months and I had never practiced with a metronome. He was funny in the studio. We were all so young, just 12 and 13 and Edward joked that it was time for us kids to have a milk and cookie break. When I played the solo on &quot;Space Cadet&quot; Edward worked on getting the right guitar sound. That was one of my favorite parts of the session. We were using one of Frank&#39;s brown Acoustic combo amps.He had 5 or 6 of them that he was using on tour and Edward played through all of them to see which one sounded best. At one point he was teaching me about doing punch in over dubs, he explained that I had to play along with the parts that were already recorded so that it would seamlessly blend with the new part I was about to record. I remember it being very difficult to do since the stuff I played for the solo was not worked out ahead of time. I did the whole solo with all of the finger tapping stuff and vibrato bar dives. Edward made up a cool part that he showed me for after the solo that lead back to the vocal but I couldn&#39;t bend the unison notes in tune since my hands weren&#39;t strong enough. So he ended up playing the unison bend melody after the solo. The slide guitar intro came about around then as well. I couldn&#39;t play that in tune either since I had never played slide before and it&#39;s a specialized technique that takes a long time to master. He played that intro as well. Watching him do that stuff was so impressive. I did all of the other guitar stuff that you hear on the record&quot;In 1984, Dweezil contributed guitar solos to both &quot;Stevie&#39;s Spanking&quot; and &quot;Sharleena&quot; on Frank&#39;s album Them Or Us.In 1986, Dweezil made his debut in Hollywood as an actor with his role in the classic 80s film &quot;Pretty In Pink.&quot; 1987 saw Dweezil raise his profile further with another film role alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mick Fleetwood in &quot;The Running Man.&quot;In television he worked as a guest MTV VJ. During that same period he recorded and released his first full length album, Havin&#39; A Bad Day. This album contained the single &quot;Let&#39;s Talk About It&quot; which featured Moon Zappa on vocals and found itself on regular rotation on MTV. The video featured cameo appearances from Frank Zappa, Robert Wagner and Jane Fonda as well.Around this same time, Dweezil made his own cameo appearances on records for a variety of diverse artists. He played a solo on the Fat Boys &quot;Baby You&#39;re A Rich Man&quot;(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipzj_FvHgT8), as well as on the Grammy Nominated cover of &quot;Wipeout&quot; with Herbie Hancock and Terry Bozzio (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INdKbZB1mBA) from the &quot;Back To The Beach&quot; film soundtrack. He was asked to join Stevie Ray Vaughan and Bonnie Raitt in contributing guitar performances to Miami Vice star Don Johnson&#39;s solo album. While Dweezil actually played on the song &quot;The Last Sound Love Makes&quot; it was his appearance in the video for Don Johnson&#39;s single &quot;Heartbeat&quot; that would most notably link him to the project.1988 saw Dweezil sign a deal with Chrysalis Records, releasing his second album My Guitar Wants To Kill Your Mama. The title track and video, a cover of the Frank Zappa single, found it&#39;s way into the MTV rotation. More TV work followed in 1990 Dweezil and Moon Zappa starred with Laverne And Shirley legend Cindy Williams in a sitcom for CBS titled Normal Life.With the release of his third album Confessions in 1991, Dweezil began to branch out musically, blending his heavy rock approach with touches of his father&#39;s distinct compositional insignia. Guest appearances on this album pointed the way toward the future for Dweezil, including contributions from Nuno Bettencourt , Gary Cherone and Pat Badger of Extreme and legendary guitarists Warren DeMartini, Steve Lukather and Zakk Wylde as well as Frank Zappa sidemen Mike Keneally and Scott Thunes. Both Moon and Ahmet Zappa also added vocals to the album.There were a handful of live shows played to support the Confessions album. That tour saw the band develop a unique set of skills and usher in the birth of a remarkable non stop medley that grew to contain 200 songs performed in 20 minutes.After completing the Confessions tour Dweezil formed a new band and project with Ahmet called Z. The band was primed to make a new album. Just as the band started to solidify the drummer Josh Freese exited.Armed with a mountain of material and no permanent drummer the band entered the family owned rehearsal space called Joe&#39;s Garage and rehearsed with several different drummers who ended up playing on tracks for the new album. Those drummers included Terry Bozzio, Mark Craney, Toss Panos, and Tal Bergman. Rather than move to a studio they set up for recording rehearsals. The band recorded over 3 dozen tracks at Joe&#39;s Garage. The &quot;Shampoohorn&quot; album was completed in 1992 but awaited it&#39;s release over a year later. It was eventually released with 2 different track listings.The band featured Mike Keneally and Scott Thunes and initiated it&#39;s new permanent drummer, Berklee School Of Music-trained drummer par excellence Joe Travers before departing for a world tour. Thunes departed later in 1994 and was replaced by Bryan Beller who had attended classes at Berklee alongside Joe Travers. The band toured the US and Europe, and in 1996 released a follow-up album, Music For Pets, which had been pieced together over the previous three years. By the time of the album&#39;s release, both Beller and Keneally had left the band and Z gradually ceased to exist. Dweezil stayed in the public eye however with several projects including composing the theme music for the Emmy Award winning Fox television show &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot; and on camera TV appearances including taking the role of Ajax in the Klasky Csupo animated series Duckman and a TV series for the USA network called Happy Hourwhich he starred in alongside Ahmet.2000 saw Dweezil issue his first solo album since 1991&#39;s Confessions with the release of Automatic. By this time, Dweezil&#39;s musicianship had come full-circle as he showed off his guitar virtuosity with eclectic all guitar orchestrations of &quot;You&#39;re A Mean One Mr. Grinch&quot; and &quot;Hawaii 5-0.&quot;In 2003 More television work came about as Dweezil formed a band for the Warner Brothers unconventional improvisational comedy &quot;On The Spot&quot; and performed live in each episode.http://www.dweezilzappaworld.com/videos/36He also composed the theme music for the WB series &quot;The Jamie Kennedy Experiment&quot; and composed dozens of tracks for the music library Extreme Music. Many of these track are heard on various television shows around the world.The next several years saw Dweezil preparing to take on an extremely difficult challengebringing his father&#39;s legendary music back to the concert stage. In 2006, some indication of what could be expected surfaced with Dweezil&#39;s next solo album Go With What You Know. The album featured Dweezil&#39;s most creative, advanced guitar work to date and he was aided by the propulsive brilliance of Joe Travers as well as keyboardist Aaron Arntz and bassist Pete Griffin, who would soon become mainstays in the live band Dweezil was putting together.Finally, in the spring of 2006, Dweezil&#39;s new live band &#39;Dweezil Zappa Plays Frank Zappa&#39; hit the road for their first, tour. Playing a long, ambitious set of Frank Zappa favorites and obscure gems to big audiences of crazed Zappa fans, Dweezil proved that he could reach his goal to form a core band of previously unknown expert musicians capable of respectfully executing his father&#39;s music. He was uniquely qualified to bring these compositions back to life with complete authenticity from the page to the stage. Helping to deliver the goods was his absolutely stellar band of first-rate musicians including Joe Travers, Pete Griffin, Aaron Arntz, brass/woodwinds/keyboards/obvious fan favorite Scheila Gonzales, percussionist Billy Hulting and guitarist Jamie Kime.Without a &quot;cosmik crystal ball&quot; it was impossible to see to how far into the future this project would last. Bearing that in mind Dweezil decided to add some extra frosting to the cake and invite some former FZ band members to join him on the inaugural tour. The earliest DZPFZ tour included band alumni Steve Vai on guitar, Napoleon Murphy Brock on tenor sax and lead vocals and Terry Bozzio on drums.This lineup was captured in the group&#39;s first Dweezil Zappa Plays Frank Zappa release on CD and DVD in 2008. This project netted Dweezil his first Grammy Award win for Best Instrumental Performance for its version of the Frank Zappa classic &quot;Peaches En Regalia&quot;.In 2007, the tour continued and new elements were introduced. Ray White joined the tour on vocals. This lineup of the band recorded their next live release Return Of The Son Of which was issued under Dweezil&#39;s name in 2010. Once again Dweezil found himself up for Grammy contention when the version of Frank&#39;s guitar solo &quot;The Deathless Horsie&quot; was nominated for Best Instrumental Performance.2009 saw DZPFZ undergo its first major personnel changes. Both Aaron Arntz and Ray White left the band and were replaced by keyboardist Chris Norton and Ben Thomas on lead vocals and trumpet. The band continued their run of successful worldwide tours, playing to devoted fans and showcasing a constantly-changing selection of Frank Zappa compositional gems. In October 2009 the band started to become known as Dweezil Zappa Plays Frank Zappa, and in 2010 they embarked on a US tour during which the band played one of Frank&#39;s best-loved albums, Apostrophe (&#39;), in its entirety.Constantly learning and evolving his guitar art, Dweezil Zappa is both the modern face of Zappa music and the person who can bring it fully-formed into the future.In 2011 he released a double CD album on U.K. label Fantom Records: &#39;Dweezil Zappa Live In The Moment&#39; which is a compilation of improvised guitar solos taken from various DZPFZ shows since 2007. His own music had been sidelined for a while but is currently experiencing a resurgence. 2012 will see new releases of Dweezil&#39;s own music (both classical and rock genres) and the continuation of his music boot camp Dweezilla, as well as another new release from Fantom Records simply titled &quot;F.O.H.&quot; a live double CD featuring Dweezil Zappa Plays Frank Zappa performances of Frank Zappa songs.In 2012 Dweezil redefined Dweezil Zappa Plays Frank Zappa&#39;s mission as a band and sculpted it into the current 6 piece configuration he takes on tour. (Dweezil Zappa Lead Guitar Vocals, Scheila Gonzales Saxophone, Flute, Keyboards and Vocals, Kurt Morgan Bass and Vocals, Chris Norton Keyboards and Vocals, Joe Travers Drums and Vocals, Ben Thomas Lead Vocals, Trumpet and Trombone.) When his father toured with smaller ensembles he referred to them as his &quot;Rocking Teenage Combo.&quot; Smaller in size doesn&#39;t mean smaller in sound. Not for Frank or Dweezil. Now able to tour in even more cities and venues because they can fit on stage easier, Dweezil&#39;s rocking teenage combo has been navigating through new geographic and musical territory. This fine assortment of hand picked musicians all have their own unique qualifications but it&#39;s their dedication to preserving and performing the detailed music of Frank Zappa that unites them and thrills audiences across the globe.Dweezil&#39;s proudest accomplishments are as father to his two daughters Zola Frank Zappa (born 2006) and Ceylon Indira Zappa (born 2008).

It was inevitable that from the moment of his birth his life would be filled wall-to wall with music (his father having listed his religion as &quot;musician&quot; on Dweezil&#39;s birth certificate). Dweezil&#39;s early years were spent largely away from the spotlightsomething of a rarity for the child of a celebrity, but perfect for cultivating a close relationship with his family.Having watched his father perform concerts from the side of the stage since he was in diapers it was no surprise that he began to show an interest in music early on. At 6 years old he received his first guitar, a Fender Music Master from his dad. It wasn&#39;t until he was 12 that he began to show a serious interest in manipulating the instrument to make music.Having primarily heard the music his father was working on or listening to at home while growing up, Dweezil soon found himself exposed to some new sounds on the radio. Besides his father&#39;s music he began listening to the Beatles, Queen, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, The Who and Jimi Hendrix. Like many aspiring guitarists of his generation, Dweezil &#39;s ear was caught in a stranglehold by the trailblazing guitar styles of Edward Van Halen and Randy Rhoads. He listened to their records for hours on end trying to figure out a way to translate what he was hearing in his head to his fingers at the other end of the guitar. Along the way, he had opportunities to ask his dad for some help. &quot;I remember asking Frank to help me figure out the song &#39;Revelation/Mother Earth&#39; from Blizzard Of Oz. I really didn&#39;t know anything about chords and in that song Randy Rhoads was using classical music elements that were really new to rock guitar at the time. Frank helped me learn the finger picking intro.&quot; To gain more fundamental knowledge of technique and scales Dweezil was fortunate to have some assistance from one of the musicians in his father&#39;s band at that time, Steve Vai. Dweezil became remarkably proficient in a very short amount of time due to his intense practicing sessions.&quot;Steve made a notebook, which I still have, of scales and exercises and I practiced the stuff from that book at least 5 hours a day.&quot; In 1982, at the age of 12 he made his first onstage appearance with his father&#39;s band at the Hammersmith Odeon in London. &quot;That was a great experience. I was so excited to have been asked to play but I was incredibly nervous. Since I could only really play lead in the key of A, Frank devised a hand signal for the band to modulate the song &#39;Stevie&#39;s Spanking&#39; down to A from it&#39;s original key of B. After I finished my solo he gave the cue for the band to modulate back up. It was so cool how he had so much control over the music, it almost seemed like a magic trick to me. It made a big impression on me and has stuck with me my whole life.&quot;Later that year he recorded his first single, &quot;My Mother Is A Space Cadet&quot;, released on Frank Zappa&#39;s Barking Pumpkin label. The amazing story behind that recording is that it was produced by Edward Van Halen. (On the sleeve it is credited as being produced by De Vards in order to avoid any contractual issues for Van Halen.)&quot;There are no words to describe how inspirational it was for me to be able to work with Edward on that recording. I was 12, a novice player and in complete awe of his super human accomplishments. I had a terrible sense of rhythm and he tried really hard to help me with that. I had only been playing for around 9 months and I had never practiced with a metronome. He was funny in the studio. We were all so young, just 12 and 13 and Edward joked that it was time for us kids to have a milk and cookie break. When I played the solo on &quot;Space Cadet&quot; Edward worked on getting the right guitar sound. That was one of my favorite parts of the session. We were using one of Frank&#39;s brown Acoustic combo amps.He had 5 or 6 of them that he was using on tour and Edward played through all of them to see which one sounded best. At one point he was teaching me about doing punch in over dubs, he explained that I had to play along with the parts that were already recorded so that it would seamlessly blend with the new part I was about to record. I remember it being very difficult to do since the stuff I played for the solo was not worked out ahead of time. I did the whole solo with all of the finger tapping stuff and vibrato bar dives. Edward made up a cool part that he showed me for after the solo that lead back to the vocal but I couldn&#39;t bend the unison notes in tune since my hands weren&#39;t strong enough. So he ended up playing the unison bend melody after the solo. The slide guitar intro came about around then as well. I couldn&#39;t play that in tune either since I had never played slide before and it&#39;s a specialized technique that takes a long time to master. He played that intro as well. Watching him do that stuff was so impressive. I did all of the other guitar stuff that you hear on the record&quot;In 1984, Dweezil contributed guitar solos to both &quot;Stevie&#39;s Spanking&quot; and &quot;Sharleena&quot; on Frank&#39;s album Them Or Us.In 1986, Dweezil made his debut in Hollywood as an actor with his role in the classic 80s film &quot;Pretty In Pink.&quot; 1987 saw Dweezil raise his profile further with another film role alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mick Fleetwood in &quot;The Running Man.&quot;In television he worked as a guest MTV VJ. During that same period he recorded and released his first full length album, Havin&#39; A Bad Day. This album contained the single &quot;Let&#39;s Talk About It&quot; which featured Moon Zappa on vocals and found itself on regular rotation on MTV. The video featured cameo appearances from Frank Zappa, Robert Wagner and Jane Fonda as well.Around this same time, Dweezil made his own cameo appearances on records for a variety of diverse artists. He played a solo on the Fat Boys &quot;Baby You&#39;re A Rich Man&quot;(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipzj_FvHgT8), as well as on the Grammy Nominated cover of &quot;Wipeout&quot; with Herbie Hancock and Terry Bozzio (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INdKbZB1mBA) from the &quot;Back To The Beach&quot; film soundtrack. He was asked to join Stevie Ray Vaughan and Bonnie Raitt in contributing guitar performances to Miami Vice star Don Johnson&#39;s solo album. While Dweezil actually played on the song &quot;The Last Sound Love Makes&quot; it was his appearance in the video for Don Johnson&#39;s single &quot;Heartbeat&quot; that would most notably link him to the project.1988 saw Dweezil sign a deal with Chrysalis Records, releasing his second album My Guitar Wants To Kill Your Mama. The title track and video, a cover of the Frank Zappa single, found it&#39;s way into the MTV rotation. More TV work followed in 1990 Dweezil and Moon Zappa starred with Laverne And Shirley legend Cindy Williams in a sitcom for CBS titled Normal Life.With the release of his third album Confessions in 1991, Dweezil began to branch out musically, blending his heavy rock approach with touches of his father&#39;s distinct compositional insignia. Guest appearances on this album pointed the way toward the future for Dweezil, including contributions from Nuno Bettencourt , Gary Cherone and Pat Badger of Extreme and legendary guitarists Warren DeMartini, Steve Lukather and Zakk Wylde as well as Frank Zappa sidemen Mike Keneally and Scott Thunes. Both Moon and Ahmet Zappa also added vocals to the album.There were a handful of live shows played to support the Confessions album. That tour saw the band develop a unique set of skills and usher in the birth of a remarkable non stop medley that grew to contain 200 songs performed in 20 minutes.After completing the Confessions tour Dweezil formed a new band and project with Ahmet called Z. The band was primed to make a new album. Just as the band started to solidify the drummer Josh Freese exited.Armed with a mountain of material and no permanent drummer the band entered the family owned rehearsal space called Joe&#39;s Garage and rehearsed with several different drummers who ended up playing on tracks for the new album. Those drummers included Terry Bozzio, Mark Craney, Toss Panos, and Tal Bergman. Rather than move to a studio they set up for recording rehearsals. The band recorded over 3 dozen tracks at Joe&#39;s Garage. The &quot;Shampoohorn&quot; album was completed in 1992 but awaited it&#39;s release over a year later. It was eventually released with 2 different track listings.The band featured Mike Keneally and Scott Thunes and initiated it&#39;s new permanent drummer, Berklee School Of Music-trained drummer par excellence Joe Travers before departing for a world tour. Thunes departed later in 1994 and was replaced by Bryan Beller who had attended classes at Berklee alongside Joe Travers. The band toured the US and Europe, and in 1996 released a follow-up album, Music For Pets, which had been pieced together over the previous three years. By the time of the album&#39;s release, both Beller and Keneally had left the band and Z gradually ceased to exist. Dweezil stayed in the public eye however with several projects including composing the theme music for the Emmy Award winning Fox television show &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot; and on camera TV appearances including taking the role of Ajax in the Klasky Csupo animated series Duckman and a TV series for the USA network called Happy Hourwhich he starred in alongside Ahmet.2000 saw Dweezil issue his first solo album since 1991&#39;s Confessions with the release of Automatic. By this time, Dweezil&#39;s musicianship had come full-circle as he showed off his guitar virtuosity with eclectic all guitar orchestrations of &quot;You&#39;re A Mean One Mr. Grinch&quot; and &quot;Hawaii 5-0.&quot;In 2003 More television work came about as Dweezil formed a band for the Warner Brothers unconventional improvisational comedy &quot;On The Spot&quot; and performed live in each episode.http://www.dweezilzappaworld.com/videos/36He also composed the theme music for the WB series &quot;The Jamie Kennedy Experiment&quot; and composed dozens of tracks for the music library Extreme Music. Many of these track are heard on various television shows around the world.The next several years saw Dweezil preparing to take on an extremely difficult challengebringing his father&#39;s legendary music back to the concert stage. In 2006, some indication of what could be expected surfaced with Dweezil&#39;s next solo album Go With What You Know. The album featured Dweezil&#39;s most creative, advanced guitar work to date and he was aided by the propulsive brilliance of Joe Travers as well as keyboardist Aaron Arntz and bassist Pete Griffin, who would soon become mainstays in the live band Dweezil was putting together.Finally, in the spring of 2006, Dweezil&#39;s new live band &#39;Dweezil Zappa Plays Frank Zappa&#39; hit the road for their first, tour. Playing a long, ambitious set of Frank Zappa favorites and obscure gems to big audiences of crazed Zappa fans, Dweezil proved that he could reach his goal to form a core band of previously unknown expert musicians capable of respectfully executing his father&#39;s music.

He was one of the most prolific musicians of his time, releasing over fifty albums of original material spanning over a thirty-five year career.\n\nZappa's earliest influences were 1950s pop and rock (such as doo-wop and rhythm and blues), and 20th-century classical composers including Igor Stravinsky and Edgard Var\u00e8se. His output was divided between adventurous instrumental compositions and succinct, catchy rock songs with ribald, satirical, or comically absurd lyrics. On stage he demanded virtuosity and spontaneity from his musicians, and employed many performers who would later go on to achieve fame in their own rights. He directed and released a number of films featuring himself, his musicians and entourage, including 200 Motels and Baby Snakes.\n\nHis career started in 1955. His earliest recordings date from the mid-1960s, and include collaborations with his school friend Captain Beefheart. In 1965 he joined a bar-band called The Soul Giants, quickly dominating its musical direction and rechristening it The Mothers. Their first release (as The Mothers of Invention; the name alteration requested by their record company) was the 1966 double album Freak Out!. The line-up of the Mothers gradually expanded to accommodate Zappa's increasingly ambitious and avant-garde music, but by 1969 he decided to work outside the band structure, focusing on his solo career, and effectively disbanding the Mothers in 1971.\n\nThe beginnings of his solo career in the late sixties and early seventies was characterised by a strong free jazz influence, with albums containing little, if any, lyrical content, such as Hot Rats, Waka/Jawaka and The Grand Wazoo. Towards the mid-seventies his albums became more rock-orientated, with a combination of Jazz Fusion instrumentation and Rock song structures. This more accessible sound bore reasonable mainstream appeal, especially with the release of the well-advertised albums Over-Nite Sensation and Apostrophe (') (which both went Gold), but Zappa's unpredictably eclectic output never led to solid mainstream recognition. He received uniformly lukewarm reviews from popular music publications such as Rolling Stone throughout his career. In his late seventies' output, the gulf between his humorous songs and more lengthy, complex instrumental music widened, and albums, such as Zappa in New York, Joe's Garage: Acts I, II & III, and Sleep Dirt displayed, by track, both sides firmly segregated. \n\nZappa saw a second run of success in the early eighties with the release of many albums with predominantly comedic rock songs, but later continued to experiment with virtually every style of music through the eighties, and was productive as ever until his death. His output in this later-career period included two albums of strikingly original classical music with the London Symphony Orchestra, an electronic take on 18th-century chamber music (written by the obscure Italian composer 'Francesco Zappa', no relation), an album of Synclavier compositions (misleadingly titled Jazz From Hell which garnered a Grammy award), a double-CD release of electric guitar instrumental music (the laconically titled Guitar) and a plenitude of official live releases, revisiting fan-favourites as well as showcasing Zappa's talent for reinventing the music of others; his version of Stairway to Heaven becoming a word-of-mouth favourite.\n\nZappa produced almost all of his own albums, spending many hours in the studio recording and manipulating tracks, and was always at the forefront of emerging technologies; from tape editing, collage, multitrack and overdubbing in the sixties to digital recording, electronic instruments and sampling in the eighties. Conversely, Zappa was also a obsessive self-archivist, recording virtually every one of his live performances, and often using live recordings of new material without needing to enter the studio. The archive of tapes at his family home in Los Angeles continues to be a source of posthumous releases for the Zappa Family Trust.  He was also noted as a spotter of talent and his shifting line-up of musicians included Lowell George, Jean-Luc Ponty, Terry Bozzio, Chad Wackerman, George Duke, Mike Keneally, Adrian Belew and Steve Vai, as well as giving Alice Cooper his first break in music and working again with his old collaborator Captain Beefheart when his career was in decline. \n\nIn the late 1980s he became active in politics, campaigning against the PMRC's music censorship scheme and acting as culture and trade representative for Czechoslovakia in 1989; and considered running as an independent candidate for president of the US. \n\nHis death in Los Angeles, California, on 4th December 1993 came three years after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Zappa\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Or sometimes, we\u2019d make the beat in the crib, write half of the song in the crib, then go to the studio and finish it. That was one of the ones where Hav ain\u2019t really like the beat. He was about to erase that shit. There\u2019s a lot of joints like that, where he was about to trash them and we had to change his mind. I was out somewhere on the block chilling probably, I came in the crib, and Hav had the beat playing. \n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Damn. What the fuck is this?\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018It\u2019s some bullshit, I\u2019m about to fucking scratch this shit and do another one.\u2019 I was like \u2018Nah, don\u2019t scratch that nigga, hold up. Let niggas hear this.\u2019 And I called niggas over like, \u2018Yo, listen to this fucking beat this nigga just made.\u2019 And everybody was like, \u2018Yo, that shit is crazy.\u2019 Then we both just started writing rhymes to it and it came out good. We knocked that out all in one day. So, I had to save that one. \n\n\u201cHav\u2019s pops was a DJ, so Hav had a lot of records from the \u201870s and the \u201880s. We both had a good record collection. Hav was already listening to records before I met him. He was trying to sample on a cassette player, hit record, pause, record, and pause, and making the beats like that. When he met me, we bought the equipment. That\u2019s when he started to really get into making beats. I actually showed him how to sample, how to do this, and how to sequence the shit. Once he got the hang of it he just went in and started going crazy.\"\n\nHavoc: \u201cI was just making beats in my crib in the projects. We had already put out \u2018Shook Ones\u2019 and our confidence was up. At that time, I was into sampling a lot of jazz records so I found this loop. I put it together. I tried to make it sound as crispy as I could when we were in the studio recording it. \n\n\u201cI remember my cousin Ferg being in the studio. He was from Brooklyn, he was running the streets wild, and he was like 16 at the time, so I said, \u2018Yo, go in the booth and just go ad-lib behind the chorus.\u2019 And he was just like, \u2018Yeah, thug life we still living it.\u2019 And this is way before Tupac [started saying \u2018Thug Life\u2019] and I don\u2019t know if he felt like he came with that first. But this is from the heart, when we did that we didn\u2019t know nothing about no Tupac. My little cousin went back there [and did the hook] and the shit was dope. He wasn\u2019t an actual rapper at that time. I know he used to write his little rhymes, but that\u2019s not actually why I put him in the booth\u2014I put him in there to get that raw, unbiased energy. \n\n\u201c that was our thing. We were just straight hood. It wasn\u2019t no pretty boy shit. It was like, \u2018Yo, let\u2019s throw on our Timbs.\u2019 It didn\u2019t get more harder than that. We weren\u2019t the kind of muthafuckas that was in the mirror for like a half an hour, nah. Nine times out of ten, we wearing the same pants for the week. We had our Timbs with our 40s on the block. It wasn\u2019t a gimmick. That\u2019s what we was wearing.\u201d \n\nMatty C a.k.a. Matt Life (Executive Producer and A&R for Loud Records): \u201cThe original version of \u2018Survival of the Fittest\u2019 had James Brown going \u2018Gotta get over before we get under!\u2019 during the chorus and that had to come out. What the publishers wanted for that little sample wasn\u2019t worth it. That was my first time dealing with those issues and helping the group make those calls about what was worth keeping.\u201d\n\nSchott Free (Executive Producer and A&R for Loud Records):\u201cI remember leaving the office and going to the studio with Havoc. He was smoking a thousand cigarettes while chopping away at something and he had had the drums up for a minute. I remember he caught that one piano piece lovely. The whole crew was like, \u2018Oooo.\u2019 He came with the rhyme and format and everything like that. \n\n\u201cThen Tip gets a hold of it. Tip leaves the loop just like it is\u2014the same way that Havoc caught it\u2014but then just infiltrates it entirely on the drum situation. It intensifies the entire record. If you ever hear the original, it\u2019s ill, it\u2019s gloomy, it\u2019s street, but it\u2019s nowhere as huge as Tip made it when he just changed up the drums. He just implemented that over the loop that Hav had and then just added so much on top of it.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mobb+Deep/_/Survival+of+the+Fittest\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

After that we\u2019d take it to the city to make it sound good. \u2018The Start Of Your Ending\u2019 was probably recorded at Platinum Island. That was one of the main places we\u2019d take the songs to after we finished. That was one of the later songs on the album.\n\n\u201cAt that point me and Havoc were making the beats together. It was produced by both of us. I\u2019d probably add a little piano or something, and he\u2019d add this. Just a late night, drinking 40s, wilding out. The usual. Mad cigarettes, mad weed. That was most likely done in one session. Because back then, we were real quick. We\u2019d make the song in the crib and then we\u2019d go back to the studio.\u201d\n\nHavoc: \u201cI was about 19 or 20 at the time. We had put out Juvenile Hell a year before that. When we made Juvenile Hell, too many people were dictating when we went to the studio. We didn\u2019t know better, we were like, \u2018Fuck it, we just got this record deal. These people are all older than us. They know what they doing. Let\u2019s just make them records.\u2019 I produced a few tracks on there\u2014maybe one or two\u2014and I was happy. But when it came out, it didn\u2019t really make any kind of noise. So now, our backs were against the wall because we knew this could be our last chance. Looking back on it, it was a lot of pressure. \n\n\u201cWe would have all of our friends in the studio, drinking 40\u2019s, smoking weed. [Laughs.] I would say from about 20 people in the studio. It was pretty wild, shit was getting broken, things went missing, food was being ordered without permission. [Laughs.] I wasn\u2019t breaking anything personally, but friends who were not used to being anywhere coming from the projects [were doing that]. [Laughs.]\n\n\u201cPeople were breaking clock radios and knobs on the mixer. Spilling beer somewhere it should not be spilt. It was like a neighborhood gathering and everybody was feeling of everybody else\u2019s energy so I would make these beats and everybody be amped up. I had the whole crew inside the studio and I was like, \u2018Fuck it, everybody get behind the mic. Introduce y\u2019all selves.\u2019 Just try to make it so real as possible.\n\n\u201cI just let the beat guide me [when I wrote my verse]. Whatever I felt when I heard the beat, that\u2019s exactly what I wrote. With my crew being around me, I incorporated them like, \u2018Yeah, keep it real like my man YG.\u2019 That was a dude from my neighborhood that was just notorious for robbing people, sniffing coke, and wilding out. Everybody was scared of him but he was just one wild individual, so I had put him in my rhyme.\u201d \n\nMatty \u201cMatty C\u201d Capoluongo a.k.a. Matt Life (Executive Producer and A&R for Loud Records): \u201cSchott worked closely with them on how the rhymes were coming and I worked closely with them on how production was coming. The first thing that I remember is them creating a semblance of the core of the first album and me creating a rough in-house version what the album could be and throwing a sticker on the cassette.\n\n\u201cThere was an initial five or six songs on a tape that was the nucleus of the album which had the original versions of songs like \u2018Survival of the Fittest,\u2019 \u2018Shook Ones,\u2019 \u2018Give Up the Goods,\u2019 and \u2018Temperature\u2019s Rising.\u2019 There was a couple of other things that didn\u2019t make the album. The major issue was, of course, the samples. \n\n\u201cThat early Mobb Deep tape, some of it leaked and a lot of people consider it a demo. But let\u2019s not forget, Mobb Deep already had a major label record deal. They had already put out a record. And if anything was to come out after that, it would be the first song that Havoc came to me with at The Source after that deal went through, which was \u2018Patty Shop.\u2019 That was what first started Mobb Deep\u2019s second run. \n\n\u201cI gave \u2018Patty Shop\u2019 to Stretch Armstrong, he played it on the radio, and Stretch really turned Steve Rifkind onto it. We wanted to come with that first, but we kept going back in the studio to make it sound better because it was made out of their house. The drums were over \u2018Halftime\u2019 and Redman was in the chorus\u2014believe it or not\u2014on a Mobb Deep song. They wanted to take some out and make it more of a track. It never came out sounding the way they wanted it to and we ended up not wanting to use it.\n\n\u201cI was the guy in there who dealt with the studio, dealt with the engineer, and I had to deal with the budget to a certain degree. My role on the project had a lot to do with overseeing the spending of the money. Initially the budget was pretty small, but we\u2019re not spending anything on producing music. Honestly, I believe it was under six figures. But the studios would decide on the food budget. Especially with Mobb Deep, it became these nasty, oppressive relationships.\n\n\u201cMobb Deep would come in 20, 30 deep and order 800 wings. And we\u2019d be over at Chung King and they\u2019d get on the bullshit, they\u2019d shut it down the next day. At the same time, I\u2019m not in there trying to regulate how P or Hav wants to blow his budget because it shouldn\u2019t be that expensive.\"\n\nSchott \u201cFree\u201d Jacobs (Executive Producer and A&R for Loud Records): \u201cThe Mobb deal wasn\u2019t for much. It was definitely less than $70,000 originally so it was probably about $60,000. Mobb Deep came in saying, \u2018We ran into Q-Tip and Tip was like, \u2018I wanna help out.\u2019 Before I knew it, I think that Matty had put in a call to Chris Lighty and we all sat. We discussed a nice little price range. It was cool to have Tip come in and be in charge of mixing the record. Some records were scrapped completely.\n\n\u201cThe album was pretty tight, but once Tip comes around he hears different things. He changes kicks, snares, whatever. Also, you get to watch Havoc implement what he had already known with a cat like Tip and Tip showing him everything he knew. Showing him a format, a formula, and even how to double on the kicks. It\u2019s just kinda ill how he just came in and just cleaned it up. His influence is mostly sonically. Playing any of those records in the club, the drums and everything is big. Tip was always a master of making a record sound huge.\n\n\u201c\u2018Start of Your Ending\u2019 that might have been the last thing done. I remember doing that sometime around the same time that we were doing the skits. The album was pretty much done so we knew what we had, so cats were feeling pretty confident at that point. On the skits you can hear that. P sketched that rhyme up in like a half an hour man. It all went pretty quick and organic and it ended up starting off the album.\u201d <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mobb+Deep/_/The+Start+of+Your+Ending+(41st+Side)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

streets again\nChasin St.Ide's down with some Seagrams Gin\nLife is like a dice game and I'm into win\n\n(Havoc)\nOn the scene from the 41st side of Queens\nWe get the CREAM, laid up, love-love for dame\n'Cause I mean what I mean, I'm out to claim King\nDoin' my thing, do wild stakes my name'll reign\n\n(Prodigy)\nTo all my peoples locked down comin' back to life\nIn the world once again though ya fear was trife\nWhile you was gone, we was goin' to war and even more\nSaw my man layin dead on the floor, kid I swore\nThat our crew will live forever, I guess I was wrong\nNo, until we meet again, hold ya head and stay strong (Yeah!)\nYo, got my mind on a place to hide from police (Where?)\nSweatin dogs as I'm runnin' cross 12th Street\nJust as I approach the block\nI spot a jake on the creep down by Vick's weed spot (So what!)\nMade a U-ey up the hill plus a change of plans\nI had to hurry back so I could warn my man\n\n(Havoc)\nYa had me stressin little sumthin, had my heart rapidly pumpin\nNiggas start a guttin behind the bushes duckin\nMy ears rung, I punch a clip into the guns\nGot (?Raydes?) in the arm, one slug hit my son\nHe was bleedin from the head, I couldn't believe it\nWe was defeated, if it was a case I couldn't beat it\nFelt like cryin (The temperature's risin')\nI saw my man helpless, damn near on the verge of dyin'\nSo to P I passed the iron\n\n(Prodigy)\nKid you ain't lyin'!\nI went to stash the murder weapon, plus I'm relyin\nOn a door to be open, goin' in the building, it's a trap!\nPolice buckin at me, they try to twist my tongue back\nJetted up the staircase to the third floor\nReached behind the sink, throw the heater on the floor\nLocked the door, police grabbed me up and tryed to break my jaw\n\"So where's the gun we saw?\"(I don't know!)\n\"We know you was there at the homicide scene\"(I don't know nuttin!)\n\"And if it wasn't you, it was somebody from ya team\"\n\nFrom the cradle to the grave\n(From the cradle to the grave)\nREPEAT x 2 1/2\n(Straight from the motherfuckin cradle to the grave!)\n\n(Havoc)\nYo, it's the real drama kills, nobody moves, stand still!\nBottle you!drop that ass off in a land-fill\nSon bless me with the iron, I got beef\nWith some niggas from the other side over some weak shit\nLoad up the heaters, greet 'em with the hollow-tips\nFlip 'em like the Gotti clip, my crew shift the body shift\nThe cradle to the grave is where I'll end up\nFuck gettin' sent up North, son I'm bent up\nDoin' my dirt on a low\nFuckin' wit them mobbers like a crowd\nNo doubt you gonna blow, you never know\nHe didn't even have to go there\nUnprepared, now he's six below\nY'know I'm chillin', I gots no time for catchin feelings\nGet that money I wants, some brothers wanna act funny\nBut it's all good I still die for the hood\nFor my peoples, yeah knock on wood\n\n(Prodigy)\nTriple L, rollin' dice while I put you on\nTo the drama what I gotta say is short not long\nThis nigga that I'm

Classic Hip Hop Lives approximately eleven months ago launched it&#39;s company with their first concert. Prodigy was at the top of their list in regards to booking, but unfortunately for them the deal never got done. Therefore, it is only right that CHHL produces a show that exhibits the love they have for P and the impact that he made on the culture. To celebrate the evening his rhyme partner of 25 years, HAVOC will be performing with a Live Band some of his favorite Mobb Deep hits along with Queensbridge\u00a0Producer/DJ LES (Nas - Life&#39;s A B*tch, AZ - Sugarhill). Joining HAVOC this evening and performing with the Live Band as well is another Queensbridge lyricist and frequent MOBB DEPP collaborator\u00a0CORMEGA. This will be a beautiful night of Hip Hop that any real fan of Hip Hop does not want to miss. For diehard Mobb Deep and Queensbridge Hip Hop fans, don&#39;t miss the live interview before the show with HAVOC, CORMEGA and Classic Hip Hop Lives founder Knowledge Beckom (must purchase\u00a0Pre-Show Ticket in addition to either GA or VIP ticket).

While Ferg and Rocky were originally planned to be the crew&#39;s Mobb Deep-like duo, they found more success as solo artists, beginning with Rocky and his series of 2012 mixtapes. Ferg&#39;s big break came that same year when his track &quot;Work&quot; landed as the key cut on A$AP Mob&#39;s Lords Never Worry mixtape. The announcement that A$AP Ferg signed with RCA came in early 2013 and was followed by an all-star remix of &quot;Work,&quot; with Trinidad James, French Montana, and ScHoolboy Q added to the cut. Ferg&#39;s &quot;Persian Wine&quot; single landed that same year, along with his solo album Trap Lord. His Ferg Forever mixtape dropped in 2014 and spawned the 2015 hit &quot;Dope Walk.&quot; A year later his &quot;New Level&quot; single arrived featuring Future, along with his sophomore album, Always Strive and Prosper, which included guest shots from Missy Elliott, Chuck D, Skrillex, and Lil Uzi Vert. In 2017, Ferg teamed up with Remy Ma for the hard-hitting single &quot;East Coast.&quot; This was followed by the release of his second mixtape, Still Striving, later that summer. The effort included a remix of &quot;East Coast,&quot; that featured Busta Rhymes, Snoop Dogg, and Rick Ross. ~ David Jeffries", "img": null, "title": "A$AP Ferg", "url": "http://desmoines.eventful.com/events/aap-ferg-/E0-001-110571000-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "7 Flags Event Center", "city": "Clive"}, {"date": "2018-01-26 22:00:00", "description": " First of all, a big thanks/big ups to everyone that has been supporting and turning up at the Hip Hop / RnB Party for the past year at TURKS HEAD, DUBLIN, we sincerely appreciate your continuous support.\u00a0After the massively LIT &quot;NYE&quot; Hip Hop / RnB party at (Bistro Bar) in TURKS HEAD, right in the heart of Dublin&#39;s Temple Bar.\u00a0We are back on JAN 26TH with the most exclusive Hip Hop / RnB party in town with top Djs playing all the 90s, 00s and new school Hip Hop & RnB tunes all night long with a twist of Grime, Funk N Soul, Bashment + much more.From Grandmaster Flash to Kendrick Lamar, Nicki Minaj to Cardi B, Jay Z to Nas + much more; Expect to hear all the classics and new school anthems all night long.Doors open 10pm till late.Tickets \u20ac10-12 on the door\u00a0For Birthday / Table Bookings and more info Call / Text / Whatsapp 0873109169\u00a0 Feel free to check out our event page on Facebook here\u00a0https://goo.gl/Zr9F1f\u20ac7 Earlybird ticket available on EVENTBRITE\u00a0https://goo.gl/AYiuaFAn Exclusive Hip Hop / R&B Party\u00a0FRIDAY 26TH JANUARY 2018\u00a0TURKS HEAD (Bistro Bar)Parliament Street, Temple BarDublin 2(10pm Till 3am) ***Spread The Word****Djs playing all the new / old school Hip Hop & RnB all night long with a twist of Trap, Grime + Funk N Soul, Reggae & Bashment!Expect to hear tracks from Migos, Kendrick Lamar, Wiz Khalifa,, Drake, Desiigner, OT Genasis, Young Jeezy, Kanye West, Rihanna, Beyonce, Bobby Shmurda, Yo Gotti, Chris Brown, Nicki Minaj, Meek Mill, Rick Ross, Ty Dolla Sign, Young Thug, Tyga, Future, The Game, Kid Ink, Dej Loaf, The Game, 50 cent, Bryson Tiller, Kevin Gates, Fetty Wap, YG, Biggie, 2Pac, Busta Rhymes, Jay Z, Mobb Deep, M.O.P, KRS One, Run DMC, PublicEnemy, Nas, L L Cool J, A Tribe Called Quest, MC Lyte, GrandMaster Flash, Sir Mix A Lot, Queen Latifah, NWA, Eric B, Rakim, Wu Tang Clan,Ja Rule, DMX, Fat Joe, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Missy Elliot, Dr Dre, Outkast, Eminem, Lil Wayne and many more.\u00a0HOSTED BY DJ DALEY X DJ LEE TRENDZ\u00a0+ SPECIAL GUESTSOVER 18&#39;S // ID REQUIRED // R.O.A.R.TURKS HEAD***** TEMPLE BAR - DUBLIN 2Turks Head is renowned for its extravagant design, complemented by mosaics & Spanish style architecture making a refreshing change from your traditional pub.

Universally referenced as one of the Masters of the Microphone and an influence and inspiration to his peers and followers alike, Rakim first exploded onto the scene with the release of iconic Eric B. is President in 1986 with long time collaborator Eric B. The single marked a turning point in the Rap world - raising the bar for future emcees and revolutionizing the way rhymes are delivered to this day. No serious discussion of the music&#39;s greatest performers is held without a deferential accounting of his achievements, and no serious rap artist grips a microphone without channeling some of his legend. <br><br> Rakim&#39;s intricately intellectual lyrics draw their force from his worldly experience, inner faith and progressive contemplation; his liquid and seemingly effortless delivery - often imitated but still unrivaled - from a fire fueled by a deep understanding of not just Hip-Hop, but also the Jazz and R&B influences that have surrounded his family since his youth. His recordings - including the all-time classics Paid In Full, Follow the Leader and The 18th Letter - have sold in the multi-millions worldwide. Billboard, Rolling Stone, MTV and a host of others consistently refer to Paid in Full as &quot;the greatest Hip-Hop album of all time&quot; - a claim that often repeated in audience polls. These Platinum albums line the walls of the Broadway, MCA and Universal labels and, with a Rakim appearance near guaranteeing an explosion of sales, he has been recruited to add his star talents to projects for Alicia Keys, Jody Watley, Damian Marley, Jay-Z, Dr. Dre, Mobb Deep, Lloyd Banks, Limp Bizkit, Gang Starr and Truth Hurts among many others. <br><br> Rakim&#39;s uncanny innovation was the focal point of the critically acclaimed recreation of Bob Marley&#39;s Concrete Jungle and has helped propel movie soundtracks such as Juice, Brown Sugar, the Rugrats, American Psycho and 8 Mile to Best Seller status. His role model status has led world famous brands such as Reebok, The Coca Cola Company, LVMH, Ecko and Sean Jean to choose him as spokesperson. <br><br> Now with twenty-five years at the top of Hip-Hop&#39;s Greatest list, the Long Island, NY native not only continues to record for himself, but also works with young artists signed to his own record imprint, Ra Records. With recent tributes in 2012 such as being named the #1 Lyricist of All Time by The Source magazine, receiving the coveted BET Lifetime Achievement Award and being nominated to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, two original music projects, his first feature film role and sold-out international tours keeping the world&#39;s eye on the one many call The GOD EmCee, Rakim Allah continues to lead where others just follow.<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/rakimallah\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rakim @ Facebook &gt;&gt;</a><br></p></p>", "img": null, "title": "RAKIM", "url": "http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/rakim-/E0-001-109883554-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "B.B. King Blues Club and Grill", "city": "New York"}], "description": "Mobb Deep is a hip-hop duo made up of Havoc and Prodigy. Both members are natives of Queensbridge, New York; located in Long Island City. They are perhaps most famous for their landmark album, The Infamous, and the accompanying hit single, Shook Ones Pt. II.\n\n1992\u20131994: Early Career\n\nProdigy and Havoc met one another while attending the prestigious High School of Art & Design in Manhattan. Coming from similar backgrounds, the duo broke into the rap game in 1992. Growing up in hostile environments that included the prevalence of poverty, drugs, and gang violence, Mobb Deep attempted to express their life experiences through rapping circa 1992. Before Havoc and P were known as Mobb Deep they were a couple of teenaged rappers known as Poetical Profits. The world first heard of them via the Source's Unsigned Hype column and this is the demo track that was quoted in that feature. The song would later see the light of day on their debut LP Juvenile Hell.\n\n\"Flavor 4 The Non Believers\" (demo version) They released their first album, Juvenille Hell, in 1993. At a time when East Coast hip hop was dominated by the jazziness of A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul, and the Afro-centric stylings of Brand Nubian and Public Enemy, their style of music eschewed the popular conscious hip hop of the time, and reflected the harsh climate of New York City in the late-1980s and early-1990s. Because both Prodigy and Havoc were still in their teens at the time of their debut, many were surprised by the violent nature of the album. Although the album was not well-received by the public, it displayed the raw talent of the duo; the unique chemistry of Prodigy's lyrical delivery combined with Havoc's melancholy beats. Through this unique style, the duo were signed by Loud Records, and began recording their sophomore album, The Infamous, in 1995, which would establish the duo in the Hardcore hip hop community.\n\n1995\u20132000: Rise to Success\n\nFollowing its release, The Infamous became perhaps one of the most influential hip hop albums of the East Coast hardcore rap genre. Still at a young age, the duo powered themselves to the top of the hardcore rap scene through their straight forward narration of street life. As with their first lyrical production, Mobb Deep portrayed the struggles of living in New York City's Queensbridge. Their production also was noticed as the beats were often hard hitting and direct, a testament to Havoc, who produced the duos' tracks almost exclusively throughout their careers. Furthermore, the hit single Shook Ones Pt. II, received acclaim as one of the greatest rap songs ever. Their third album, Hell On Earth was released in 1996, debuting at number six on the Billboard album chart. The album continued their portrayal of harsh street life, while further pushing them to the forefront of the hardcore rap scene, along with contemporary East Coast rappers such as Notorious B.I.G., The Wu-Tang Clan collective, Jay-Z, and fellow Queensbridge associate, Nas.\n\nIn 1999, the duo released the highly anticipated Murda Musik album. Despite extensive bootlegging (nearly thirty songs of unreleased material leaked onto the internet) and countless delays, the album debuted at number three on Billboard and quickly went platinum \u2014further highlighted by the popular single, Quiet Storm. Shortly afterwards, Prodigy released his long awaited solo album H.N.I.C (2000), in which the rapper collaborated with other artists and producers (including The Alchemist).\n\n2001\u20132004: Decline\n\nSome time after the release of Murda Muzik, rapper Jay-Z, spoke out against the duo, leading to an increase in publicity. At the Hot 97 Summer Jam show of 2001, Jay-Z performed the freestyle, \"Takeover\", which he later re-recorded for the The Blueprint LP, dissing Prodigy. He also revealed photographs allegedly of Prodigy wearing a dance leotard in 1988. Mobb Deep subsequently released Infamy in 2001. The album marked a major stylistic change that saw the duo move away from the raw, minimalist, stripped-down beats of their hardcore roots, towards more commercial fare with such songs as Hey Luv. This transition fostered accusations of \"selling out\" \u2014 upsetting many long-time fans who did not wish to see them veer away from their original style. Although this stylistic adjustment opened up Mobb's audience to a wider variety, many critics and fans credit Prodigy's feud with Jay-Z with damaging Mobb Deep's gangster image and record sales (most evident when comparing the platinum-selling Murda Muzik to Infamy barely reaching the gold status). Not to be fazed, Prodigy noted that his lifelong bout with sickle cell anemia and his beef with Jay-Z had changed his outlook.\n\nIn 2003, the group split with Loud Records and released The Murda Mixtape which proclaimed \"Free Agents\" on the cover, addressing the group's split with Loud and search for a new label. Jive Records signed the duo later in the year and subsequently released Amerikaz Nightmare in 2004, which was seen by the general rap audience as a weaker release by the two - resulting in poor sales and the subsequent dropping of the duo from Jive.\n\n2005\u2013Present\n\nIn the spring of 2005, it was announced that the duo signed with G-Unit Records. This came as a surprise to many, as 50 Cent aimed a sly diss at them on the \"Piggy Bank\" track. The duo made it known that this was not the case as Havoc stated in an interview, \"Mobb Deep isn't gonna change and when we first got here 50 was like, 'Listen, I want y'all to keep doing what you been doing.' That's it.\" 50 Cent has a connection to the duo, as he grew up in nearby Jamaica, Queens and also has used Havoc as a producer for several different beats. The relationship became deeper than business as the Mobb and 50 Cent got tattoos to pledge their loyalty to each other. Prodigy has the words \"G-Unit\" tattooed on his right hand and 50 has \"Mobb Deep\" tattooed on his wrist. Upon signing to G-Unit, both Prodigy and Havoc were given new Porsches, for two artists who have received very little monetary compensation in the past.\n\nThey currently have recorded their album, titled Blood Money which was released on May 2, 2006. It features G-Unit members 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, and Young Buck. This marks their seventh release and has vaulted the duo into the hip-hop spotlight. As one of the most recognized names in hip-hop, it is hoped that G-Unit will help Mobb Deep attract a new fanbase. As Havoc stated shortly after the deal, \u201cAs an artist, you want to be able to reach the furthest audience as you can. We put in hard work on our previous albums and still hit our core fan base. The difference this time around is that more people will hear this product this time.\u201d Despite this, many of the Mobb's longtime fans are skeptical as G-Unit is known for their mainstream crossover music, and fear that Mobb Deep will conform to this style.\n\nTechnique\n\nEarly on, Mobb Deep gained their critical acclaim for a dark, dynamic, grimey sound with haunting melodies--Havoc's production--that to many represented \"street\" in a way not done by many or any before. Additionally, Prodigy's penchant for starting off a verse with an attention-grabbing line, writing compelling rhymes based heavily on Queensbridge slang, and a rambling but clear delivery appealed to fans on the lyrical aspect.\n\nFor some time, Prodigy was the star MC of the duo, Havoc sounding less focused on the lyrical aspect and more on production. This continued until The Alchemist was brought in to do a few beats for each album, after which Havoc seemed to begin concentrating more on his verbal prowess, slowly developing his own style. After the beef with Jay-Z, Prodigy changed his style, rhyming words less and slowing down his delivery, while Havoc increasingly contributed more to the rhyme end of the duo. After being on independant labels, such as LOUD, and then a larger label JIVE, styles from the grimy, gritty styles from the QB duo changed greatly, much to the despair of the mainstream fans, never fully recovering from the Jay-Z beef, they were forced into the limelight, and after releasing the street wood effort of Infamy, never reclaiming the status of the best kept secret. Signing with G-Unit seems to have worsened their career and Blood Money, their first album released on G-Unit, only sold approximately 110,000 in its first week, coming in at #3 on the Billboard 200. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mobb+Deep\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

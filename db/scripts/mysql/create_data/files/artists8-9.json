His mother is half Lebanese, half American Indian, his father Irish-American. While his peers got off on cheesy corporate rock and the kind of line-dancing tunes recently fashionable in Gap ads, Shawn was groovin to the blaxploitation funk Sly and the Isleys. Later, his local Baptist Church widened his appreciation of black music, but when he sang and played drums in its gospel choir, he discovered some of his white friends were racists who disapproved. F**k this, he thought, time to leave the Mid-West but not before playing in local band Lotus with future country superstar Martina Mcbride.\n\nNext stop Los Angeles. Already an able multi-instrumentalist (guitar, drums, perc,bass, etc) Shawn now set about developing his songwriting. There were bands, publishing deals, relationships,tours and day jobs: more notches on the bedpost of experience. Shawn was introduced to producers the Dust Brothers( post Paul's Boutique) and spent much time hanging out,drinking cappuccino's and making mix tapes from their dusted record collection. .This period also saw Shawn befriend the late Jeff Buckley, and somebody, somewhere has a tape of them jamming Honky Tonk Woman. \"Keith your fired\"!!!!!\n\nIn 1995, Shawn moved to London, where he recorded his solo debut for DJ Gilles Peterson's Talkin Loud label. For all the wrong reasons, the album was never released. It was soul destroying; a bit like somebody erasing 3 years of your life. Resolving to write and record on his own terms, Shawn kept working. He created the infamous \"Planet of the breaks\" series aswell as 5 volumes of \"Ape Breaks\" becoming the most sampled drummer of his generation in the process. He passed CDs of songs to friends with no agenda other than hope you enjoy it. As Shawn continued to do it his way, airplay garnered by a self-financed EP prompted several major labels to phone him. He had no intention of reboarding the corporate merry-go-round. Instead, he opted to sign a deal with Mark Jones at Wall of Sound. \"The labels got real credibility\" he says, \"Mark was happy to put out a record which sounds exactly like I wanted it to\". Subsequently Shawn became the flagship artist for the new Wall of Sound imprint, We Love You with his album Monkey Boy which features the cult song Happiness. The song was later covered by million selling english artist Will Young on his Keep On album. Say what?!\n\n2004 saw the release of two Shawn Lee albums. Soul Visa (in Japan only, on Rush!) and the debut release of Shawn's instrumental side project Shawn Lee's Ping Pong Orchestra. The first of which is entitled Music and Rhythm on Ubiquity Records. 2005 also saw two more records from Mr. Lee; Harmonium (in Japan only, on Rush!) and the second Ping Pong album Moods and Grooves. As the success of the Ping Pong series grew Shawn was offered his first full movie soundtrack. The movie is entitled \"Save Angel Hope\" and will be released in 2007. The Industry has been quick to embrace the Ping Pong sound. PPO tracks have been featured in the TV series: Malcom In The Middle, Lost, Desperate Housewives, CSI: Miami, Ugly Betty, Boston Legal, Rodney,Damages, Good Morning America etc., Movies: Oceans 13, The Break Up,The Bank Job, Pool Hall Prophets. Ads for BMW, Cinemax, Jaguar, Barclays, Exxon, Head & Shoulders and numerous Skate,snowboarding & Surf films. Shawn also has composed a video game soundtrack for Rockstar (Grand Theft Auto etc.). The game is entitled \"Bully\" and was released in october 2006. The selected soundtrack album for Bully/Canem canis edit is available on itunes,emusic and was released in stores december 2006 on Ultra.\n\n2006 an American and European release for Soul Visa and the release of volume three Strings and Things by the Ping Pong Orchestra. Also look out for Mr. Lee doing \"No Surprises \" on an a Radiohead covers album called \"Exit Music\". Plus vocal collaborations with Muallem, Silent Poets, Sparo and Blackjoy. Remixes for The Thievery Corporation, Nino Moschella, Dust Galaxy, Jack Arel, Tony Joe White, Elmer Bernstein and Lord Large. November 2006 saw Shawn Lee's Ping Pong Orchestra vs Nino Moschella EP hit the streets featuring \"Kiss The Sky\".\n\nJanuary 2007, the fourth Ping Pong Orchestra album \"Voices and Choices\" was released and features guest vocals from: Ohmega Watts, Nino Moschella and Pierre D. Shawn chips in with textural vocals and takes the PPO sound onto some next level shit! Kiss The Sky (from the 4th Ping Pong album \"Voices and choices\"), becomes itunes \"single of the week\" and is downloaded a quarter of a million times in one week! Not one to rest, Mr. Lee has been beavering away in his London studio \"Trans-Yank\" on a number of new albums including a Ping Pong POP covers album entitled \"Hit's The Hits\" which was released on October 9, 2007, followed swiftly by a Ping Pong Christmas album called \"A Very Ping Pong Xmas\".\n\n2008: Feb. 5th see's the release of the enigmatic Clutchy Hopkins album \"Walking Backwards\". Look out for this supremely dope album featuring a collaboration track with yours truly called \"Song For Wolfy\"! April will see the release of the 7th Ping Pong Orchestra album entitled \"Miles Of Styles\". It features some new musical maneuvers and the first lead vocal from Shawn on a PPO record! The Funky Tiger is also putting the finishing touches on the \"Under The Sun\" surf film soundtrack as we speak. The original soundtrack album will be released on Ubiquity later in the year. So move over, Shawn Lee is now \"the new hardest working (tiger) man in show business!!!\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Shawn+Lee%27s+Ping+Pong+Orchestra\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

From backwoods bluegrass, to slinky nods to Muscle Shoals soul and unexpected bits of doo-wop sweetness, the Banditos recall many, but sound like no one but themselves.The members of the band first met playing in various punk and rock n roll projects around Birmingham at D.I.Y., all-ages venues. In 2010, singer/guitarist Corey Parsons and singer/banjo player Stephen Pierce began busking around town, and were soon asked to perform at their favorite local bar. Without a full band they invited friends Randy Wade (drums), Jeffrey Salter (guitar), and Mary Beth Richardson (vocals) to join them.Salter and Wade studied together at music school learning classical/jazz techniques, while Richardsons background was mostly singing in church choirs. After some apprehension from Richardson about taking the stage with an unrehearsed band, a last-minute trip to New Orleans with the group (which resulted in a stolen hotel Bible inscribed with the bands lyrics) seemed to cure a case of the cold feet. The ensuing performance was raw and electric, and an ecstatic crowd response further cemented the members convictions to become a full band. The addition of bassist Danny Vines made the group complete.The members soon moved into a house together in Birmingham and after repeated tours through Nashville decided to move the band there instead, where the music scene was bigger and more diverse. The sextet has since developed their unique and airtight sound, culminated through several years of enduring friendships and a roaddog touring schedule that has, at their count, numbered over 700 shows in the last three years.Their selt-titled debut full-length album is layered with as much grime as it is with pinpoint songwriting and feverish technical savvy. Each song wafts new dynamics into a streamlined stylistic roots, punk and rock n roll jet stream, the variations heard evidently through the vocal baton passing and wrenching harmonies of Parsons, Richardson, and Pierce. Each vocalist, as with each performer in the band, is given the spotlight during the course of the albums 12 songs. And at its core, Banditos is a unified coalescence of six bright beams of light, a spiritual collaboration between friends with a singular musical vision. The mutual understanding between the two musicians is reflected in the way this hypnotic duo musically communicates with their public.

Written and composed by the group's original tenor, Lew DeWitt, the song peaked in popularity in January 1966, spending four weeks at No. 2 on the Billboard magazine Hot Country Singles chart, and reaching No. 4 on the Hot 100 chart.\n\nIn the years since its release, \"Flowers on the Wall\" became one of the trademark songs of the Statler Brothers' 40-year career.\n\nThe song is a wryly humorous account of a man's isolated life. Recounting his sad, daily pursuits, \"Counting flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all, playing solitaire till dawn with a deck of fifty-one, smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo,\" are all acts of boredom and lost purpose as well as isolation. The Chorus of the song ends with the words: \"So don't tell me I've nothing to do.\"\n\nThe song gained exposure amongst a new generation after it was used by Quentin Tarantino in Pulp Fiction.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Statler+Brothers/_/Flowers+on+the+Wall\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He joined them first as a temporary replacement for Lew DeWitt, after DeWitt heard him singing at a ski resort and recommended him. Following an audition in Nashville, Jimmy was contacted by the Statler Brothers and performed his first show with them on January 28, 1982, in Savannah, Georgia. Due to the debilitating effects of Crohn\u2019s Disease, Lew was unable to return to the stage with the Statlers, andJimmy was hired as a permanent replacement in August of 1982.<br> Fortune quickly lived up to his name. He wrote the group\u2019s second No. 1 hit, \u201cElizabeth,\u201d on their 1983 album Today, and followed that with two more No. 1 hits\u2013\u201cMy Only Love\u201d (from 1984\u2019s Atlanta Blue) and \u201cToo Much On My Heart\u201d (from 1985\u2019s Pardners in Rhyme). Fortune also wrote the top-10 hit \u201cForever\u201d from 1986\u2019s Four for the Show and co-wrote the top-10 hit \u201cMore Than a Name on the Wall\u201d from 1988\u2019s The Greatest Hits.<br> Jimmy has performed in all of the U.S. States, in Canadian Provinces, and in front of audiences as large as 100,000. He was part of the Statlers\u2019 annual Happy Birthday USA celebration in Staunton, Virginia, for 14 years. He also sang on many of the Statlers\u2019 gold, platinum, and double platinum recordings.

Especially on a debut album. Time and attention-strapped listeners size up an artist within a song or two, then move on or delve in further. Fortunately, it only takes Margo Price about twenty-eight seconds to convince you that you&#39;re hearing the arrival of a singular new talent. &quot;Hands of Time,&quot; the opener on &#39;Midwest Farmer&#39;s Daughter&#39; (coming Spring 2016, Third Man Records), is an invitation, a mission statement and a starkly poetic summary of the 32-year old singer&#39;s life, all in one knockout, self-penned punch. Easing in over a groove of sidestick, bass and atmospheric guitar, Price sings, &quot;When I rolled out of town on the unpaved road, I was fifty-seven dollars from bein&#39; broke . . .&quot; It has the feel of the first line of a great novel or opening scene in a classic film. There&#39;s an expectancy, a brewing excitement. And as the song builds, strings rising around her, Price recalls hardships and heartaches -- the loss of her family&#39;s farm, the death of her child, problems with men and the bottle. There is no self-pity or over-emoting. Her voice has that alluring mix of vulnerability and resilience that was once the province of Loretta and Dolly. It is a tour-de-force performance that is vivid, deeply moving and all true. <br><br> &quot;I&#39;m writing from my heart and life experiences,&quot; Price says. &quot;I knew I wanted to start the record with this song, but everyone in the band said, &#39;No, no, that&#39;s a bad move.&#39; And then Third Man said, &#39;We think this should be the first song,&#39; and I was like, &#39;Yes!&#39; It really just lays it out. If you can get through &#39;Hands of Time,&#39; the rest of the record is going to come very easily.&quot; <br><br> And indeed it does. The honky tonk comeuppance of &quot;About To Find Out,&quot; the rockabilly-charged &quot;This Town Gets Around&quot; and weekend twang of &quot;Hurtin&#39; (On The Bottle)&quot; all add fresh twists to classic Nashville country, while sounding like they could&#39;ve been hits in any decade. Meanwhile, the hard-hitting blues grooves of &quot;Four Years of Chances&quot; and &quot;Tennessee Song&quot; push the boundaries further west to Memphis (the album was recorded at Sun Studio). Throughout, producer Alex Munoz, engineer Matt Ross-Spang and the ace band help frame the material with spare, spacious arrangements, keeping the focus on Price&#39;s soulful vocals. <br><br> &quot;I think about an artist like Bobbie Gentry, who was able to mix country with soul,&quot; Price says. &quot;But really, I never set out to make a country soul record. It&#39;s just that I like Etta James, and I like Hank Williams, and sometimes those things come together and make nice little babies.&quot; <br><br> Her tastes developed early. Growing up in Aledo, Illinois (pop. 3,612), Price was surrounded by music -- everything from Tom Petty to the Statler Brothers. By middle school, she was singing in the choir and doing the national anthem at local football games. &quot;I was one of the only people who could sing it without changing keys,&quot; she says, with a laugh. With money from her eighth grade graduation, Price bought her first guitar and started writing songs, influenced by Joni Mitchell and Maria Muldaur. After dropping out of college, she moved to Nashville in 2003 and began the usual apprenticeship of open mic nights and networking. <br><br> Though she loved the friendliness of Music City, she says, &quot;I didn&#39;t feel like the glossy country music at the time had any space for me.&quot; On the advice of her great uncle, Bobby Fischer, a successful tunesmith with over 500 cuts by artists including George Jones, Tanya Tucker and Reba McEntire, she kept writing and honing her voice. She soon met bass player -- and future husband -- Jeremy Ivey, and formed a band called Buffalo Clover. They self-released three records and built a local following. Of course, the music biz being the minefield of dreams that it is, there were false promises and glittering temptations along the way (humorously catalogued in &quot;This Town Gets Around&quot;). &quot;I&#39;m so glad that I didn&#39;t sacrifice my integrity five or ten years ago,&quot; Price says. &quot;I had opportunities to. I remember meeting this one guy who said, &#39;I&#39;m a big producer and I know all these people on Music Row.&#39; So Jeremy and I tried to write some mainstream country songs. We created pen names because we didn&#39;t want anyone to know it was us -- Sylvia Slim and Sam Pickens. Together it was Slim-Pickens. We wrote a couple things, and I felt gross doing it. The producer guy didn&#39;t like it, and we didn&#39;t either. So it was, &#39;All right, I tried that, now I&#39;m just going to write for myself.&#39;&quot; <br><br> That decision was brought into even sharper focus by personal tragedy. &quot;I lost my firstborn son to a heart ailment,&quot; Price says, &quot;and I was really down and depressed. I was drinking too much. I was definitely lost. I did some things that I regret very much now that resulted in a brush with the law. Thank god I had my friends and family to keep me going. Coming through that, I thought, &#39;I&#39;m just going to write music that I want to hear.&#39; It was a big turning point.&quot; <br><br> With a new batch of songs, Price approached producers and labels. Nobody responded. Feeling like &quot;an outcast in Nashville,&quot; she turned her sights on Memphis instead. &quot;I once heard someone say, &#39;Nashville has glitz, but Memphis has grit.&quot;&#39;And I&#39;m like, &#39;Hey, I&#39;ve got grit too! I&#39;m gonna go to Memphis and make this record.&#39;&quot; <br><br> A year before, she had visited the legendary Sun Studio, as a tourist. &quot;The first time I walked in the room, the guide said, &#39;This is where Elvis stood.&#39; They have the X on the floor, and she said, &#39;It&#39;s rumored that Bob Dylan came in and kissed the X on the floor.&#39; So I waited for everybody to leave, then I got down on my knees, and thought, &#39;There, now I&#39;ve kissed both Bob Dylan and Elvis.&quot; <br><br> Her curiosity piqued by a &quot;Make Your Own Demo at Sun&quot; sign, Price met the house engineer, Matt Ross-Spang. &quot;He and I clicked right off the bat. I liked his energy. He had great ideas. We did a single, and it didn&#39;t turn out the way I wanted. But Matt was persistent about us working together again.&quot; To finance the sessions for &#39;Midwest Farmer&#39;s Daughter,&#39; Price and Ivey skipped the usual crowd-funding route, instead selling one of their cars, some instruments and even pawning her wedding ring. Price says, &quot;My husband said, &#39;This is all or nothing. I believe in you. I believe in this record. I&#39;ll sell our house if it comes down to it.&#39;&quot; <br><br> In Memphis, Price and her band worked the night shift, from 7pm-2am (after the museum had closed), cutting tracks live to analog tape. &quot;It was cool to do later sessions,&quot; she says. &quot;It&#39;s like doing shows, where you&#39;re singing at 11 o&#39;clock. My voice was already warmed up. It was such a relaxed vibe at Sun. And it felt haunted in a good way, like Elvis and Johnny were watching over us.&quot; <br><br> With the album done, Price says she shopped it to &quot;literally every label in Nashville.&quot; Except the one where it ended up. &quot;Honestly, I didn&#39;t think it would fit at Third Man,&quot; she says. &quot;Then a friend said, &#39;You&#39;re on Jack&#39;s radar, he wants to hear the record.&#39; I was like, &#39;No way.&#39; I sent it over, and it just felt like home. A good creative space to be involved in, and everyone is so down to earth. It was awesome when I met with Jack. He told me he thought my voice was a breath of fresh air, and that he loved the record.&quot; <br><br> As Price looks ahead to a busy 2016, full of touring and promoting &#39;Midwest Farmer&#39;s Daughter,&#39; she reflects on her hopes for what listeners might get from these songs. &quot;I hope that the record helps people get through hard times or depression. That&#39;s ultimately what music did for me in my childhood, and especially in my early adult years. It&#39;s about being able to connect personally with a song, and hopefully, it makes you feel not so lonely.&quot;", "title": "MARGO PRICE - NOWHERE FAST TOUR -Particle Kid", "url": "http://phoenix.eventful.com/events/margo-price-nowhere-fast-tour-particle-kid-/E0-001-106552242-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Crescent Ballroom", "date": "2018-02-18 20:00:00"}], "description": "The Statler Brothers were an American country music vocal group founded in 1955 in Staunton, Virginia.\n\nOriginally performing gospel music at local churches, the group billed themselves as The Four Star Quartet, and later The Kingsmen. In 1963, when the song \"Louie, Louie\" by the garage rock band also called The Kingsmen became famous, the group elected to bill themselves as The Statler Brothers. Despite the name, only two members of the group (Don and Harold Reid) are actual brothers and none have the surname of \"Statler\". The band, in fact, named themselves after a brand of facial tissue they had noticed in a hotel room (they joked that they could have turned out to be the Kleenex Brothers). Don Reid sang lead. Harold Reid, Don's older brother, sang bass. Phil Balsley sang baritone and Jimmy Fortune sang tenor after replacing original tenor Lew DeWitt in the early 1980s due to the latter's ill health. DeWitt died on August 15, 1990 of heart and kidney disease, stemming from complications of Crohn's disease.\n\nThe band's style was closely linked to their gospel roots. \"We took gospel harmonies,\" said Harold Reid, \"and put them over in country music.\"\n\nThe group remained closely tied to their gospel roots, with a majority of their records containing at least one gospel song. They produced several albums containing only gospel music and recorded a tribute song to the Blackwood Brothers, who influenced their music. The Statler Brothers also wrote a tribute song to Johnny Cash, who discovered them. The song was called \"We Got Paid by Cash\", and it reminisces about their time with Cash\n\nSince forming, the Statler Brothers have released over 40 albums. They received Grammy Awards in 1966 and 1973. Two of their best-known songs are their first big hit, Flowers on the Wall, and the socially-conscious Bed of Roses. Late in their career they had a regular variety show on the cable television channel then known as The Nashville Network. Throughout their career, much of their appeal was related to their considerable ability for comedy and parody that they frequently interspersed into their musical act; they were frequently nominated for awards for their comedy as well as their singing. They recorded two comedy albums as Lester Moran and the Cadillac Cowboys, and one-half of one side of the album Country Music Then and Now was also devoted to satirizing small-town radio stations' Saturday morning shows.\n\nThe group disbanded and retired after completing a farewell tour on October 26, 2002. Balsley and the Reid brothers continue to reside in Staunton, while Fortune has relocated to Nashville, where he is continuing his music career as a solo artist. He has released three albums as a soloist. The Statlers continue to be the most awarded act in the history of country music.\n\nSince the Statlers' retirement in 2002, Don has pursued a second career as an author. He authored or co-authored three books: Heroes and Outlaws of the Bible, Sunday Morning Memories, and You'll Know It's Christmas When.... He and Harold co-wrote a history of the Statler Brothers titled Random Memories released in February 2008.\n\nThe Statler Brothers have been credited as the first country music act to transfer the genre's nostalgia from a rural to a suburban setting. They have also been called \"America's Poets\" by Kurt Vonnegut. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Statler+Brothers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His signature booming left-hand and fleeting right created a unique sound that can be heard on his recordings as a sideman with the John Coltrane Quartet in the 1960s and on his 80-plus albums as a leader. Tyner&#39;s most recent project for McCoy Tyner Music/Half Note Records is his first solo effort in almost a decade titled Solo: Live From San Francisco. The release is the third for his label and features eleven solo vignettes recorded at the Herbst Theater in 2007. <br><br>Tyner&#39;s blues based piano style, replete with sophisticated chords and an explosively percussive left hand has transcended conventional styles to become one of the most identifiable sounds in improvised music. His harmonic contributions and dramatic rhythmic devices form the vocabulary of a majority of jazz pianists. <br><br><br><br>Born in 1938 in Philadelphia, he became a part of the fertile jazz and R&B scene of the early &#39;50s. His parents imbued him with a love for music from an early age. His mother encouraged him to explore his musical interests through formal training. <br><br>At 17 he began a career-changing relationship with Miles Davis&#39; sideman saxophonist John Coltrane. After Coltrane left Davis&#39; band, Tyner joined Coltrane for the classic album My Favorite Things (1960), and remained at the core of what became one of the most seminal groups in jazz history, The John Coltrane Quartet. The band, which also included drummer Elvin Jones and bassist Jimmy Garrison, had an extraordinary chemistry, fostered in part by Tyner&#39;s almost familial relationship with Coltrane. <br><br>During his tenure with John Coltrane, Tyner also held the piano chair on seminal albums such as Live At The Village Vanguard in 1961, Ballads, Live at Birdland in 1963, Crescent, A Love Supreme, The John Coltrane Quartet Plays, Kulu Se Mama, Ascension, Sun Ship, and Meditations. &quot;He was like a big brother to me,&quot; Tyner recently said of Coltrane. &quot;He looked out for me and taught me an incredible amount. It was a wonderful period in my life.&quot; <br><br>In 1965, after over five years with Coltrane&#39;s quartet, Tyner left the group to explore his destiny as a composer and bandleader. Among his major projects is a 1967 album entitled The Real McCoy, on which he was joined by saxophonist Joe Henderson, bassist Ron Carter and fellow Coltrane alumnus Elvin Jones. His 1972 Grammy-award nomination album Sahara, broke new ground by the sounds and rhythms of Africa. Since 1980, he has also arranged his lavishly textured harmonies for a big band that performs and records when possible. <br><br>In the summer of 2005, Tyner joined forces with the Blue Note Jazz Club in New York and became the first client of Blue Note Management. That summer, Tyner began work on some unique projects, including performances with tap-dancer Savion Glover and the development of the Impulse! Septet, featuring his trio with some of today&#39;s top hornmen. <br><br>Tyner&#39;s partnership with the Blue Note has led to the formation of his own record label, aptly titled McCoy Tyner Music. The label is a subsidiary of the Blue Note&#39;s <br>In-House record label, Half Note Records. The label launched on September 11, 2007, upon the release of Tyner&#39;s latest CD, &quot;Quartet&quot; featuring Joe Lovano, Christian McBride, and Jeff &quot;Tain&quot; Watts. <br><br>McCoy Tyner&#39;s second release for the McCoy Tyner Music label, titled GUITARS, was released on September 23, 2008. The recording features the stellar rhythm section of Tyner, Ron Carter, and Jack DeJohnette with four modern guitarists (and one banjo) of our time: Bill Frisell, Marc Ribot, John Scofield, Derek Trucks, and Bela Fleck. The package is a CD/DVD that includes 3 hours of multi-angle viewing capabilities. In August 2009, Tyner released his third recording for McCoy Tyner Music, a solo piano performance recorded live in San Francisco during the summer of 2007 titled Solo: Live From San Francisco. The recording featured Tyner playing eleven vignettes, both standards and original compositions. <br><br>Tyner has always expanded his vision of the musical landscape and incorporated new elements, whether from distant continents or diverse musical influences. More recently he has arranged for big bands, employed string arrangements, and even reinterpreted popular music. Today, Tyner has released nearly 80 albums under his name, earned four Grammys and was awarded Jazz Master from the National Endowment for the Arts in 2002. He continues to leave his mark on generations of improvisers, and yet remains a disarmingly modest and spiritually directed man.

Sar & The Real McCoy, was a German Eurodance group, who are best known for their international hits Another Night in 1993 and Run Away in 1994.\n\nReal McCoy was the brainchild of German rapper and producer Olaf \"O-Jay\" Jeglitza. After having released a few limited edition 12\" singles in Germany under the name \"The Alliance\" with friend Frank \"Quickmix\" Hassas, their first major breakthrough came in December  1989 when a cover of the Technotronic hit \"Pump Up The Jam\" went to #16 on the German singles chart.\n\nAt this point, the act was faceless so for the second single, the original track It's On You, singer Patsy Petersen and 'rapper' Shampro were enlisted to join the group. O-Jay felt uncomfortable being the frontman so Shampro mimed O-Jay's raps. The single, on its release in 1990, climbed to #11 in Germany. An album \"On The Move\" was also released.\n\nAfter this things went a little quiet for a while until they hooked up with David Brunner, Head of A&R at Hansa Records. He was impressed by a song O-Jay had co-written called \"Another Night\" but was dissatisfied with Patsy's vocals.\n\nConvinced he had a hit on his hand, Brunner persuaded O-Jay to let him release the new version of \"Another Night\" with Patsy (miming Karin Kasar's vocals) and O-Jay to replace Shampro as the new \"M.C. Sar & The Real McCoy\". It was a #18 hit in Germany in 1993 and all over continental Europe, followed by the album \"Space Invaders\" but then Clive Davis at Arista Records in the USA showed some interest. He had already had success taking Ace of Base to the States and now wanted to do the same with a re-branded Real McCoy.\n\nA new video was made, another singer Vanessa Mason was found to form a trio and the single shot to #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in late 1994, also reaching #1 on Radio & Records magazine's CHR/Pop Airplay chart. It was also re-released in the United Kingdom, where it had only reached #61 the previous year. This time it was far more successful and within three weeks had climbed to #2, selling more than 312,000 copies and also reached #1 in Australia. The Follow-up, Automatic Lover (Call for Love) reached #52 on the Billboard Hot 100, #10 in the UK, and #5 in Australia. \"Run Away\" became the follow-up single to \"Automatic Lover\"; it became the groups second #1 single in Australia and also got to #3 in the USA in early 1995 (and #6 in the UK). A freshened-up US album called \"Another Night\" was released, with some new tracks, also with vocals by Karin Kasar, and Real McCoy were awarded Best New Act at the American Music Awards in 1995.\n\nLove & Devotion was a #11 hit in the UK in April of that year, and Come And Get Your Love, a cover of the song by Redbone, peaked at #19 on both sides of the Atlantic ending a great year for the act. Shortly afterwards, Patsy left the act and was replaced by Lisa Cork.\n\nIn 1997, Real McCoy returned with a new single and album called One More Time, this time with Vanessa Mason and Lisa Cork actually performing on the record. The album was co-written with American songwriter/producer Brent Argovitz who brought Lisa Cork into the band. The single itself was released in many nations around the world on vinyl and CD-Maxi Singles with a total of 18 remixes amongst all the releases. One More Time (the single) peaked at #27 on the Billboard Hot 100. It became a Top 20 hit on both Rhythmic/Dance format radio and on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. However, \"One More Time\" completely missed the UK Top 75. A few other singles were released such as a cover of the Shania Twain hit, (If You're Not In It For Love) I'm Outta Here! and I Wanna Come (With You) (which \"Bubbled Under\" the Hot 100). Before long the group disbanded.\n\nAlthough the group decided to stop recording together, a completely new line-up were hired to form a \"new\" Real McCoy in 1999, much like the producers of 2 Unlimited had done a year earlier. Jason, Gabi and Ginger recorded a brand new version of the 1990 hit It's On You, which was released only in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In 2000, they also released a new song titled \"Hey Now\". Both singles failed to chart.\n\nO-Jay went on to produce and re-mix for several German artists such as Yvonne Catterfeld, B3, Daniel K\u00fcblb\u00f6ck and ATC.\n\nIn 2003, O-Jay released a solo CD single under the A45 record label (Germany) with several mixes of his winning eurodance formula called \"Nite to Remember\", a song very reminiscent of the Real McCoy tracks with his rap and female vocals.\n\nSeveral \"greatest hits\" compilations have been issued in recent years, and O-Jay started his own weblog in 2004, in which he finally revealed that the group's biggest hits had in fact been performed by Karin Kasar. He has also speculated that yet another Real McCoy group was being lined up without his permission, but so far they have not been launched. O-Jay still performs under the name Real McCoy and collaborated with Ich Troje to represent Poland at the Eurovision Song Contest 2006. The song, Follow My Heart, failed to qualify for the grand final.\n\nIn early 2007, O-Jay started a new record label, Phears Music, with a distribution partnership with Sony BMG in Germany. He also released a brand new four track digital single \"People Are Still Having Sex\", a cover of LaTour's 1980's house hit, in anticipation of a new album and tour for Real McCoy in 2008. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Real+McCoy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Celebrating decades of recording and touring that have nearly singlehandedly reshaped the definition and scope of the blues via the infusion of exotic sounds from the Caribbean, Africa and South Pacific, the two-time Grammy winning singer, songwriter, film composer, guitarist and multi-instrumentalist was feted with the Lifetime Achievement for Performance Award at the 13th Annual Americana Honors and Awards.Ive been performing for over 50 years, and to be recognized for the road Ive traveled means the world to me, says Mahal, who during the show performed Statesboro Blues which he first recorded on his eponymous 1968 debut album on dobro with a band that included Cooder and Don Was. I could not have done this without the audience that has been so supportive of me throughout my musical journey. It was a fantastic night and I was thrilled to be there and celebrated among such other outstanding American musical treasures like Jackson Browne and Flaco Jimenez, whose music and talent I am a fan of. It certainly represented a diversity of musical styles and culture. Thats what Im talking about essay help!The night at the legendary Ryman Auditorium capped another extraordinary year for Mahal, which began with a performance at the Gregg Allman Tribute Concert in Atlanta and included playing on the entire Blind Boys of Alabama Christmas album; performing as part of the Bonnaroo Superjam on a bill featuring Derek Trucks with Chaka Khan, Eric Krasno from Soulive, renowned R&B/blues session drummer James Gadson, David Hidalgo from Los Lobos and Susan Tedeschi; and playing and recording with Van Morrison in Dublin.Since the release of 2008s Maestro, his most recent studio recording which received a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Blues Album, Mahal has been busier than ever touring and recording at a whirlwind pace with old friends and fellow musical sojourners. In 2010, after being nominated for Entertainer of the Year by the Blues Foundation, he joined Jimmy Fallons Late Night studio band The Roots as a special musical guest on the Rolling Stones classic Shine a Light. He also opened in Lake Tahoe for Bob Dylan. One of the highlights of the following year as performing a special opening solo set for Eric Clapton and Wynton Marsalis at Lincoln Center; Mahal also performed several songs with his two fellow legends. The concert was recorded and released as a CD and CD/DVD entitled Wynton Marsalis & Eric Clapton Play The Blues Live From Jazz at Lincoln Center.After starting 2012 producing and performing (vocals, guitar and banjo) on Vusi Mahlaselas live album Say Africa, Mahal joined the critically acclaimed Experience Hendrix tour for a three week run that included performances by everyone from Buddy Guy, Dweezil Zappa and Robby Krieger to Robert Randolph, Jonny Lang, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Keb Mo and Living Colour. Energized anew after the Sony Legacy release of two collections celebrating the riches and rarities of his musical legacy the two disc set The Hidden Treasures of Mahal Mahal 1967-1973, featuring a full live 1970 concert from Royal Albert Hall, and The Complete Columbia Albums Collection box set, featuring all of his LPs from 1968-1976 the bluesman enjoyed a wildly productive 2013.That spring found Mahal singing and playing harmonica on Further Down the Road from Claptons Old Sock album, and performing as a featured guest at Claptons Crossroads Guitar Festival at MSG (NYC) where over 30 of the worlds greatest guitarists played sidemen to each other over two nights. Mahal jammed with The Allman Brothers Band featuring David Hidalgo and Cesar Rosas of Los Lobos and in a special unplugged acoustic set with Keb Mo.That June marked the release of the all-star soundtrack album to Ghost Brothers of Darkland County, a supernatural blues n roots musical featuring music and lyrics by John Mellencamp, a libretto by author Stephen King and production by T-Bone Burnett. Mahal appeared on Home Again with Sheryl Crow, Dave Alvin and Phil Alvin, in addition to Tear This Cabin Down and What Kind of Man Am I. He later performed on Vicksburg Blues on actor/recording artist Hugh Lauries album Didnt It Rain and a new rendition of his song Winding Down on the Sammy Hagar & Friends recording. He capped the year with An Evening with Taj Mahal at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles.Mahals career has been full of and defined by colorful twists and turns, unexpected whimsical ventures and a commitment to a muse that has long preferred freewheeling innovation to conformity. So theres always the challenge of finding the right words and phrases to capture just what hes meant to American music over the past half century. Miles Mellough, who wrote the stark and honest, no holds barred liner notes for The Complete Columbia Albums Collection, captures the complexities perfectly on several posts he penned on his blog Birds with Broken Wings after the box set came out.Heres the thing, plain and simple, he writes. Taj Mahal has always been a conundrum; a man who is capable of mirroring many things to many people, and the reason why is because hes an enigma an alchemist and a contrarianThrough his music hes been a dirt farmer, a man of gentry, and a Mississippi riverboat gambler. Hes played the role of the pious country preacher of old South camp meetings to a chain gang prisoner breaking rocks in the hot, midday sun. Hes been a hard-boiled harp player with a gold tooth and process blowing gritty on the South side of Chicago to a West Indies fishing boat captain sipping Banana Daiquiris with a St. Kitts womanLike the blues tree with its many roots, Mahal has become the sum of many parts. But if you were to strip him of the elements that have come to define him publicly, youd no doubt find that beneath it all hes really just a simple man with a harp, a steel guitar, and a banjo in his rucksack; a man making music with a whole hell of a lot of heart and soul.In another post, Mellough ruminated on the global fusion approach Mahal has taken to the blues, which has caused its share of controversy: While purists may have sometimes had issues with his unusual blend of acoustic blues mingled with the sweet sounds of Africa, the West Indies and South Pacific Islands, I believe Mahal elevated the music form to an entirely new plane. By approaching the blues from a global perspective, Mahal presents it as part of a broader musical palette, a world canvas. Using traditional country blues as a starting place, Mahal perfumes the pot by mixing a spicy concoction of Afrocentric roots music, a blues gumbo kissed by reggae, Latin, R&B, Cajun, Caribbean rhythms, gospel, West African folk, jazz, calypso, and Hawaiian slack key. The savory dish he serves is both a satisfying and uplifting stew that actually transforms singin the blues into something to be very happy about.The Early YearsThe parents of Harlem born Henry St. Claire Fredericks, Jr. (Mahals given name until his dreams of Gandhi, India and social tolerance inspired him to change it) came of age during the Harlem Renaissance and instilled in their son a sense of pride in his West Indian and African ancestry. Growing up in Springfield Massachusetts, Mahals father was a jazz pianist, composer and arranger of Caribbean descent (called The Genius by Ella Fitzgerald) who frequently hosted musicians from the Caribbean, Africa and the U.S. His mother was a schoolteacher and gospel singer from South Carolina. Henry Sr. had an extensive record collection and a shortwave radio that brought sounds from across the world into their home.Back in the 1950s, Springfield was full of recent arrivals from all over the globe, allowing Mahal to understand and appreciate many world cultures. We spoke several dialects in my house Southern, Caribbean, African and we heard dialects from eastern and western Europe, he says. In addition, musicians from the Caribbean, Africa and all over the U.S. frequently visited the Fredericks home, and Mahal became even more fascinated with roots the origins of the various forms of music he was hearing, the path they took to reach their current form, and how they influenced each other along the way. He threw himself into the study of older forms of African-American music, which the major record companies of the day largely ignored.Mahals parents started him out on classical piano lessons, but he soon expanded his scope to include clarinet, trombone and harmonica and discovered his talent for singing. His stepfather (his mother remarried after Henry Sr. was killed in a tragic accident) owned a guitar and Mahal began playing it in his early teens, becoming serious when a guitarist from North Carolina moved in next door and taught him the various styles of Muddy Waters, Lightnin Hopkins, John Lee Hooker and Jimmy Reed and other titans of Delta and Chicago blues.Before music became a viable option, Mahal who first began working on a dairy farm at 16 and was a foreman by 19 thought about pursuing a career in farming. Over the years, this ongoing passion has led to him performing regularly at Farm Aid concerts. In the early 60s, he studied agriculture (minoring in veterinary science and agronomy) at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, where he formed the popular U. Mass party band, the Elektras. After graduating, he headed west in 1964 to Los Angeles, where he formed the Rising Sons, a six-piece outfit that included guitarist Ry Cooder.The band opened for numerous high-profile touring artists of the 60s, including Otis Redding, the Temptations and Martha and the Vandellas. Around this same time, Mahal also mingled with various blues legends, including Howlin Wolf, Muddy Waters, Junior Wells, Buddy Guy, Lightnin Hopkins and Sleepy John Estes. He and Cooder also worked during this period with the Rolling Stones, and in 1968, he performed in the classic film The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus.This diversity of musical experience served as the bedrock for Mahals first three recordings: Taj Mahal (1967), The Natchl Blues (1968) and Giant Step (1969). Drawing on the eclectic sounds and styles hed absorbed as a child and a young adult, these early albums showed signs of the musical exploration that would become Mahals hallmark in the years to come. In the 1970s, Mahal carved out a unique musical niche with a string of adventurous recordings, including Happy To be Just Like I Am (1971), Recycling the Blues and Other Related Stuff (1972), the GRAMMY-nominated soundtrack to the movie Sounder (1973), Mo Roots (1974), Music Fuh Ya (Music Para Tu) (1977) and Evolution (The Most Recent) (1978). The type of blues he was playing in the early 70s showed an aptitude for spicing the mix with exotic flavors that kept him from being an out and out mainstream genre performer.Mahals recorded output slowed somewhat during the 1980s as he toured relentlessly and immersed himself in the music and culture of his new home in Hawaii. Still, that decade saw the well-received release of Mahal in 1987, as well as the first three of his celebrated childrens albums on the Music For Little People label. He returned to a full recording and touring schedule in the 1990s, including such projects as the musical scores for the Langston Hughes/Zora Neale Hurston play Mule Bone (1991) and the movie Zebrahead (1992). Later in the decade, Mahal released a series of recordings with the Phantom Blues Band, including Dancing the Blues (1993), Phantom Blues (1996), and the two GRAMMY winners, Seor Blues (1997) and the live Shoutin in Key (2000). Overall, he has been nominated for nine GRAMMY Awards.During this same period, Mahal continued to expand his multicultural horizons by joining Indian classical musicians on Mumtaz Mahal in 1995, and recording Sacred Island, a blend of Hawaiian music and blues, with the Hula Blues Band in 1998. Kulanjan, released in 1999, was a collaborative project with Malian kora master Toumani Diabate (the kora is a 21-string west African harp). Mahal felt that this recording embodied his musical and cultural spirit arriving full circle. He recorded a second album with the Hula Blues Band, Hanapepe Dream, in 2003, followed by the European release Zanzibar in 2005. His 2008 Heads Up International recording Maestro marked the 40th anniversary of his recording career and featured performances by Ben Harper, Jack Johnson, Angelique Kidjo, Los Lobos, Ziggy Marley and others many of whom have been directly influenced by Mahals music and guidance.What inspires me most about my career is that Ive been able to make a living playing the music that I always loved and wanted to play since the early 50s, Mahal says. And the fact that I still am involved in enjoying an exciting career at this point in time is truly priceless. Im doing this the old fashioned way and it aint easy. I work it and I earn it. My relationship with my audience has been fun, with great respect going both ways! I am extremely lucky to have fans who have listened to the music I choose to play and have stayed with me for 50 years. These fans have also introduced their children, grandchildren and in some cases great-grand children to this fabulous treasure of music that I am privileged to represent. Its very exciting, to say the least.Like ancient culture, he adds, the people are as much a part of the performance as the music. Live communication through music, oh yeah, its right up there with oxygen!", "title": "TAJ MAHAL", "url": "http://charlotte.eventful.com/events/taj-mahal-/E0-001-108207899-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "McGLOHON THEATER at Spirit Square", "date": "2018-01-26 20:00:00"}], "description": "Ziggy Alberts is a home-schooled songwriter, free surfer & environmental enthusiast based out of Byron Bay, Australia.

Tijdens het festival wordt met een frisse blik gekeken naar de huidige ontwikkelingen binnen de jazz, waar de inspirators binnen het genre het podium delen met de jonge innovators. Meer informatie over het festival en de artiesten is te vinden op <a href=\"http://festivals.tivolivredenburg.nl/transition/2018/\" rel=\"nofollow\">transitionfestival.nl</a>.</strong><p><strong></strong>Een van de drijvende krachten in de hedendaagse jazz is toetsenist <strong>Cory Henry</strong>. Hij verkreeg bekendheid door zijn bijdrages in fusioncollectief Snarky Puppy, maar is tegenwoordig minstens zo bekend onder zijn eigen naam. Cory Henry speelt al sinds zijn tweede orgel en heeft sindsdien met jazz, gospel en elektronica als bouwstenen een volstrekt eigen, funky sound ontwikkeld.\u00a0Voor de samenstelling van zijn band <strong>The Funk Apostles</strong> heeft hij een selectie gemaakt van muzikanten die eerder ervaring hebben opgedaan in de bands van Booker T Jones, Lauryn Hill, Aretha Franklin en Erykah Badu. Met deze groep doorgewinterde musici maakte hij het debuutalbum \u2018Chapter 1: The Art of Love\u2019, vol aanstekelijke nummers maar met live voldoende ruimte voor improvisatie.<p><br><strong>Lizz Wright</strong> behoort tot de nieuwe generatie jazzvocalisten die voortbouwt op de erfenis van Nina Simone, Ella Fitzgerald en Billie Holiday, maar met een eigentijdse draai. De domineesdochter leerde het vak op de ouderwetse manier: met het zingen en spelen van gospelnummers in de kerk, maar met haar warme en diepe stem kan Wright eigenlijk elk genre aan. Op haar nieuwe album Grace (2017) gaat ze terug naar haar roots: het diepe, Amerikaanse zuiden van Amerika. Het resultaat is verrassend bluesy!\u00a0<p>Vijftig jaar na zijn doorbraak is <strong>Pat Martino</strong> terug met een nieuw album Formidable (2017), zijn eerste studioalbum in elf jaar tijd. De invloedrijke 73-jarige gitarist speelde in zijn beginjaren vaak met organisten, maar werd uiteindelijk vooral bekend om zijn snelle en vloeiende fusion-gitaarspel. Op zijn nieuwe album keert hij juist weer terug naar het geluid van uit zijn beginjaren, met een grote rol voor Hammondorganist Pat Bianchi, door Downbeat magazine bestempeld als \u00e9\u00e9n van de beste organisten ter wereld.\u00a0<p>De Noorse jazzformatie <strong>Jaga Jazzist</strong> is al 23 jaar heer en meester in het ruim opvatten van de term \u201cjazz\u201d. Zo hoor je in hun muziek net zo goed elementen uit electronica, (post-)rock en klassiek. Hun laatste wapenfeit Starfire stamt alweer uit 2015 en een nieuw album laat nog even op zich wachten, maar de nieuwe single Prokrastinopel (met gastrol voor Reine Fiske van de Zweedse progrockband Dungen) klinkt alweer veelbelovend. Bovenal komt hun muziek het beste tot zijn recht op het podium, waarmee de achtkoppige band inmiddels een ijzersterke reputatie heeft opgebouwd. \u201cBerekenend en zelfverzekerd, virtuoos, gedreven en ongelofelijk veelzijdig.\u201d schreef Written In Music over hun laatste optreden in Utrecht.<p>In 2007 presenteerde Eric Vloeimans zijn nieuwe elektrische band <strong>Gatecrash</strong> met het livealbum Gatecrashin\u2019 en scoorde daar meteen een Edison Award mee. Tien jaar later heeft de band internationale bekendheid vergaard en is momenteel een van Vloeimans\u2019 voornaamste projecten. De band bestaat uit een vaste bezetting met Jeroen van Vliet (op fender rhodes en keys), de IJslandse bassist Gulli Gudmundsson en drummer Jasper van Hulten, maar wordt voor deze show op Transition aangevuld met de innovatieve en eclectische gitarist Jorrit Westerhof.<p><strong>Phronesis</strong>, de band rondom bassist, componist en bandleider Jasper H\u00f8iby, is geen onbekende op het Transition Festival; afgelopen editie speelde het akoestische trio voor een afgeladen Hertz zaal. Op de komende editie van Transition presenteert Phronesis hun nieuwe bigband gedreven album The Behemoth. Voor deze gelegenheid breidt het trio hun bas/drums/piano bezetting uit met het twaalfkoppige <strong>New Rotterdam Jazz Orchestra</strong>, bestaande uit een aantal sleutelfiguren uit de Nederlandse jazzscene zoals Bart Wirtz, Rob van de Wouw en Jan Duikeren. In 2017 schitterden ze al met deze formatie op North Sea Jazz festival, wat zo goed beviel dat dit unieke project op reprise komt op Transition.<p><em>Meer namen volgen snel.<br><br><em>Op de hoogte blijven van al het jazzaanbod in TivoliVredenburg?\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.tivolivredenburg.nl/nl/informatie/detail/37/Nieuwsbrief\" rel=\"nofollow\">Schrijf je in voor de jazznieuwsbrief!</a></em></em></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>", "title": "Transition Festival 2018", "url": "http://eventful.com/events/transition-festival-2018-/E0-001-102307101-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "Netherlands", "venue": "TivoliVredenburg", "date": "2018-04-14 15:30:00"}, {"city": "Budapest", "description": " <p> If we asked which Norwegian band produced the most top 10 albums in their home country, many would not respond saying Motorpsycho yet so far almost all of their albums produced in their powerful thirty years of rolling were hitting the tops of the sales lists. However, the band really can not be considered a friendly songwriting machine. Much more as if Steppenwolf met with Pink Floyd and Miles Davis, a hard rock psychic feel dipped in crumbling fusion jazz roared from Motorpsycho&#39;s vintage amplifiers. The trio, which has appeared on Sziget several times, is coming to their first Hungarian club concert with a new drummer to present their latest album Tower with elemental power.<br> <br><strong>Motorpsycho (NO)</strong><br><p> Named for a movie by American sexploitation auteur Russ Meyer, Motorpsycho are a Norwegian band whose music is an adventurous fusion of progressive rock, psychedelia, alternative rock, folk-rock, hard rock, and old-school heavy metal. Motorpsycho were formed in Trondheim, Norway in the fall of 1989 by guitarist Hans Magnus &quot;Snah&quot; Ryan, bassist Bent Saether, and drummer Kjell Runar &quot;Killer&quot; Jenssen, who all knew one another from playing the regional club circuit with various bands. After cutting a demo in 1990 (which was released under the title Maiden Voyage) and releasing their debut LP, Lobotomizer, in 1991, Jenssen left the band and H\u00e5kon Gebhardt, a high-school friend of Ryan&#39;s, took over behind the drums.<p> Demon Box After a handful of EPs and vinyl-only releases, the new Motorpsycho lineup added a fourth member, Helge Sten on keyboards and electronics, and they cut the grand-scale 1993 double album Demon Box, which earned enthusiastic reviews while expanding the group&#39;s following. The band stayed busy in the studio, releasing a pair of EPs in late 1993 and early 1994, leading up to Timothy&#39;s Monster, an expansive work spread out over two discs on CD and three LPs on vinyl. After the release of Timothy&#39;s Monster, Sten dropped out of Motorpsycho as a full-time bandmember, though he continued to work with the group in the studio and appeared at their live shows as his schedule permitted; guitarist Morten Fagervik and keyboardist Lars Lien came aboard in his place.<br> Blissard In 1995, the group released The Tussler, the original soundtrack album to a movie that existed only in Motorpsycho&#39;s imagination, and despite a busy touring schedule, they returned with another album, Blissard, in 1996. By the time Angels and Daemons at Play was released in 1997, Fagervik and Lien had dropped out of the group, and the core trio of Ryan, Saether, and Gebhardt soldiered on, releasing their next studio effort, Trust Us, in 1998, and the first in their series of Roadwork albums (collecting live recordings from the group&#39;s archives) in 1999.<p> Black Hole/Blank Canvas In the 21st century, Motorpsycho kept up a hectic recording and performing schedule, releasing four studio albums, another Roadwork volume, and a collaborative EP with Jaga Jazzist Horns between 2000 and 2003; during this period, elements of jazz and electronic music also began playing a larger role in their music. In 2005, Gebhardt left Motorpsycho, and the 2007 album Black Hole/Blank Canvas found Ryan and Saether recording as a duo with guest percussionist Jacco van Rooij and vibraphonist Oyvind Brandtsegg. Released in 2008, Little Lucid Moments marked the recording debut of Motorpsycho&#39;s new full-time drummer, Kenneth Kapstad, and in 2009 the band celebrated its 20th anniversary with a vinyl-only album, Child of the Future, recorded with engineer Steve Albini. Another studio set, Heavy Metal Fruit, was released in 2010 and the fourth Roadwork collection followed in 2011.<p> The Death Defying Unicorn In 2012, Motorpsycho collaborated with keyboardist/composer/arranger St\u00e5le Storl\u00f8kken (Supersilent, Elephant9, Humcrush, Terje Rypdal) and the Trondheim Jazz Orchestra. They released a re-imagined studio version of the 2011 concert work The Death Defying Unicorn, which was commissioned by the Molde International Jazz Festival for their 50th anniversary. They returned with the genre-defying Still Life with Eggplant in 2013, and followed it with the sprawling Behind the Sun in March of 2014. Later that spring the band announced The Motorpnakotic Fragments, an extremely limited-edition (1,200) album created from four 7&quot; vinyl singles; also included was a disc of the entire album. It was shipped throughout the fall of 2014.<br> En Konsert For Folk FlestMotorpsycho kicked off 2015 with a deluxe five-disc reissue of their 1993 album Demon Box. Originally recorded as a double, it was trimmed and released as a single album. The set restored the entire recording in proper sequence, was fully remastered, and contained bonus EPs, rarities, and a concert video disc. It was followed by a live acoustic vinyl offering entitled En Konsert for Folk Flest. Also that year, Rockheim, the Norwegian national museum of rock, displayed a 25-year retrospective exhibition of the band called Supersonic Scientists. For the first time in their career, Motorpsycho assembled a retrospective collection; entitled Supersonic Scientists: A Young Person&#39;s Guide to Motorpsycho; it featured one track each from their &quot;regular&quot; studio album catalog outside of soundtracks, live recordings, collaborations, or special projects. It was followed in February by the brand new single,a cover of H.P. Lovecraft&#39;s cover of Terry Callier&#39;s &quot;Spin Spin Spin.&quot; The full-length Here Be Monsters was released a month later. The album&#39;s origins lie in a commission for the centennial jubilee of the Norwegian Technical Museum in November, 2014. The music was written for the expanded version of Motorpsycho that features Storl\u00f8kken, though he did not participate in the recording sessions due to time constraints. Following the touring for Here Be Monsters, drummer Kapstad left the band, leaving S\u00e6ther and Ryan to write and rehearse their live score for the Carl Frode Tiller play Begynnnelser.

The core of the band are brothers and main songwriters Lars Horntveth and Martin Horntveth. Martin formed Jaga Jazzist together with Ivar Christian Johansen in 1994 while they still were in their teens. Johansen later left the group to start other projects like Ravi (hip hop). The Horntveth brothers are also prominent figures of the Norwegian pop act The National Bank, besides solo projects.\n\nThe band feature trumpets, trombone, electric guitar, bass, tuba, bass clarinets, Fender Rhodes, vibraphone and a rack of electronics, as well as strong melodies and rhythms. Talk Talk, Soft Machine, John Coltrane, Don Cherry, Aphex Twin, Stereolab, Squarepusher and Tortoise are frequently mentioned as sources of inspiration. Jaga Jazzist is widely considered to be one of the premier acts of the so-called nu-jazz movement of Scandinavia.\n\nFree tracks can be downloaded at their offical website, http://www.jagajazzist.com. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jaga+Jazzist\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

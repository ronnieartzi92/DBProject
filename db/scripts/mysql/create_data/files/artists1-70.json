It was released on 16 May 2016 by XL Recordings as the third single from the album. The song was written by Adele, Max Martin and Shellback, while production was provided by the latter two. A pop song, the singer herself describes it as a \"happy you're gone\" song dedicated to an ex-boyfriend. \"Send My Love\" managed to appear on various international charts following the release of 25; following its release as a single, it has so far peaked at number 5 in the UK, number 9 in the US and number 10 in Canada.\n\nAn accompanying music video directed by Patrick Daughters premiered on 22 May 2016 at the 2016 Billboard Music Awards. It features Adele singing the song against a black backdrop with many shots of herself overlapping one another. Music critics mostly praised the clip for its minimalist, simple concept and joyful nature. \"Send My Love (To Your New Lover)\" is part of the set list during Adele's third concert tour, Adele Live 2016, which visits countries across Europe and North America. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Adele/_/Send+My+Love+(To+Your+New+Lover)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Adele was crowned winner of the Crown Royal Comedy competition in the city of Chicago on February 3rd 1990. Since that day Adele has realized that she was destined to become comedic royalty. Since then Adele has the rare ability to make you laugh, think, cry, and cringe all at the same time!! Her famous catch line \u201cI am SUCH a #$%@#% Lady\u201d has gone viral. Her work is popular and she can be heard on songs by Big Sean, Lil Kim, The Brat! Her bold and on point insights continue to delight and amaze her fans and peers alike. Popularity was swift with Adele winning many other competitions and securing the respect of comedy lovers everywhere. Almost immediately fans proclaimed Adele Givens the Queen of Comedy. The title is well deserved with such credits as Russell Simmons&#39; Def Comedy Jam, The All Stars of Def Comedy Jam. Showtime at the Apollo. The Oprah Winfrey show. HBO Comedy half-hour, Comedy Central Presents, Queen Adele has certainly reigned supreme. <p>It wasn&#39;t long before Queen Adele made her acting debut, guest-starring in such sitcoms as Martin, Moesha, The Parkers, The Steve Harvey show, a recurring role on The Tracey Ullman show and becoming a series regular on the hit sitcom The Hughley\u2019s to name a few. Loving her newfound tree, Queen Adele branched out to do her very own morning radio show (The Adele Givens morning show on WGCI 107.5 FM Chicago), but not before filming her first movie role as Tricks in the film, The Player\u2019s Club. Before long, HBO recognized her majesty by offering her a chance to do her own HBO Half-hour comedy special and television pilot The Adele Givens show. Adele also served as co-host of the Source Magazine Awards pre-show. Queen Adele Givens wowed audiences everywhere on the very successful Queens of Comedy tour (13 consecutive sold out dates and the album was nominated for a Grammy Award), and made us laugh out loud as the hip hop loving, bad hair day having, DJ (I\u2019Holla) Helen in the movie Beauty Shop. <p>Now the Queen of comedy, Grammy nominated artist, Soul Train Comedy Award nominee, and experienced television and film actress, had added the titles writer. Producer and Director to her resume. She is currently filming a movie she wrote and directed (The real extreme and confusing blaxploitation of \u2026.SCANKHOSE.) All this and beautiful too! It\u2019s safe to say that the little girl from Chicago\u2019s west side has done the city proud! <p>On February 3rd 1990 Queen Adele Givens was crowned the winner of the Crown Royal comedy competition at the Regal Theatre in Chicago!

Her debut album, 19, was released in January 2008 and entered the UK album chart at #1. The album has since received four-times Platinum certification in the UK and has sold 5,500,000 copies worldwide. The album included the hugely popular song Chasing Pavements. 19 earned Adele two Grammy Awards in February 2009 for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. \n\nHer second album, 21, was released on January 24th 2011 in the UK and propelled Adele to unprecedented mega-stardom. In just eleven months, 21 received fourteen-times Platinum certification in the UK for shipments in excess of 4,500,000 copies, and has sold a further 6,200,000 copies in the US denoting sextuple-Platinum status. As of January 2012, 21 has sold an estimated seventeen million copies worldwide. The album has produced three global chart-topping singles thus far: Rolling in the Deep, Someone Like You, and Set Fire to the Rain. 21 won Adele six awards at the 2012 Grammy Awards, among them Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Record of the Year.\n\nAdele graduated from BRIT School in Croydon in May 2006, where she was classmates with Leona Lewis. Adele credits the school with nurturing her talent. In school, she was more interested in going into A&R, and hoped to launch other people's careers. Four months later, she published two songs on the fourth issue of the online arts publication PlatformsMagazine.com. She had recorded a three-song demo for a class project and gave it to a friend who posted it on Myspace where it became very successful and led to a phone call from music label XL Recordings. She doubted if the offer was real because the only record company she knew was Virgin Records, and she took a friend with her to the meeting. Nick Huggett at XL Recordings recommended Adele to manager Jonathan Dickins at September Management and in June 2006 Dickins became her official representative. September was managing Jamie T at the time and this proved a major attraction for Adele who was a big fan of the English singer-songwriter. Huggett then signed Adele to XL Recordings in September 2006.\n\nAdele's breakthrough song, Hometown Glory, was released in October 2007. Adele provided vocals for Jack Pe\u00f1ate's song, My Yvonne, from his debut album. Adele became the first recipient of the BRIT Awards Critics' Choice and was named the number-one predicted breakthrough act of 2008 in an annual BBC poll of music critics, Sound of 2008. She released her second single Chasing Pavements on 14 January 2008, two weeks ahead of her debut album, 19. Chasing Pavements reached number two on the UK Chart, and stayed there for four weeks, finally remaining in the Top 40 14 weeks after its release. The album itself entered the British charts at number one. The Times Encyclopedia of Modern Music would name 19 an \"essential\" Blue Eyed Soul recording.\n\nIn June 2013, Adele was awarded an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours list for services to music.\n\nThe much-anticipated third studio album \"25\" was released on November 20, 2015 on the label XL. The first single from the album, \"Hello\", was released on Friday, October 23, 2015.  \n\nGrammy Awards (2017) - At the 59th Grammy Awards on Sun, February 12, 2017, Adele took the awards for \"Album of The Year\" and \"Best Pop Vocal Album\" for \"25\". and \"Song Of The Year\" and \"Best Pop Solo Performance\" for \"Hello\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Adele\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The group largely wrote the song during recording sessions in Southern France in 1987. The lyrics were written by the band's frontman Robert Smith, who drew inspiration from a past trip to the sea shore with his future wife. Before Smith had completed the lyrics an instrumental version of the song was used as the theme for the French television show Les Enfants du Rock.\n\n\"Just Like Heaven\" was the third single released from the band's 1987 album Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, while Smith's memories of the trip formed the basis for the song's accompanying music video. The song became The Cure's first American hit and in 1988 reached number 40 on the Billboard charts. It has been highly praised by critics and covered by artists such as Dinosaur Jr and Katie Melua. Smith has said he considers \"Just Like Heaven\" to be one of the band's strongest songs.\n\n\nBackground and recording\n\nIn order to develop material for Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Robert Smith forced himself to write music for 15 days of each month. During this regimen, he developed the chords and melody which form the basis of \"Just Like Heaven\". Structurally, Smith found what he had written was similar to The Only Ones's 1979 hit \"Another Girl, Another Planet\". When he brought an instrumental demo of the song to the album recording sessions in Southern France, Cure drummer Boris Williams increased the tempo and added an opening drum fill which inspired Smith to introduce each instrument singularly and in sequence.\n\nWhen the French TV show Les Enfants du Rock asked The Cure to provide a theme song Smith offered the instrumental version. As he explained, \"it meant the music would be familiar to millions of Europeans even before it was released\". He completed the lyrics when the group moved the sessions to Studio Miraval, located in Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur. The band completed the song quickly, and at the time Smith considered it to be the most obvious potential single from the songs the band had recorded during their two week stay at Miraval.\n\nB-side - \"Snow in Summer\"/\"Breathe\"/\"Sugar Girl\"/\"A Chain of Flowers\"\nReleased - 5 October 1987\nFormat - 7\", 12\", CD\nRecorded - Studio Miraval, France, 1987\nGenre - Alternative rock\nLength - 3:32\nLabel - Fiction\nWriter(s) - Robert Smith, Simon Gallup, Porl Thompson, Boris Williams, Lol Tolhurst\nProducer - David M.

The song is the most successful single by the band, reaching number five in their home country of the UK, and the music video won the 1990 Best British Video at the 1990 Brit Awards.\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nThe meaning of \"Lullaby\" has been speculated by fans, including as a metaphor for addiction or for depression, and Smith has offered multiple, different explanations as to its theme or content. Tim Pope, a long-time collaborator of The Cure on many of its music videos, reported that \"Lullaby\" was, in fact, an allegory for lead singer Robert Smith's druggy past.\n\n\n\nMusic video\n\nThe music video for \"Lullaby\" was filmed at a sound stage in London, England. It features Robert in bed, in a dream sequence, and the rest of the band playing tin soldiers who sporadically appear throughout the music video for a few seconds. The music video, during which Smith plays both the cannibalistic \"spiderman\" mentioned in the lyrics (which does not refer to the similarly-named Marvel Comics superhero) and his intended victim, concludes with Smith being swallowed by what appears to be a giant spider.\n\nThe music video, directed by Tim Pope and edited by Peter Goddard won Best Video at the 1990 Brit Awards.\n\n\nReception\n\nUpon its release, \"Lullaby\" became The Cure's highest charting hit in their home country when it reached number five; in fact, it remains their only single to reach the Top 5 in the UK\n\n\n\nReleased-10 April 1989\nFormat-7\", 12\"\nGenre-Alternative rock, dark wave, gothic rock\nLength-4:10\nLabel-Fiction Records\nProducer(s)-Robert Smith, Dave Allen <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cure/_/Lullaby\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was used as the theme music for the BBC sitcom The Smoking Room, for the BBC food programme A Taste of My Life presented by Nigel Slater and plays over the closing credits for the 2007 film Son of Rambow. On its original release, the single was most successful in Ireland, peaking at #4, also reaching #7 in Australia. It was remixed in 1990, which itself was released as a single, peaking at #13 on the UK singles chart.\n\nThere are two versions of \"Close to Me\", one with a brass section and one without. The version without the brass section is the original album version on The Head on the Door while the version with brass instruments is a remix that was released as a single and appears on Staring at the Sea: the Singles. The instrumental brass section appearing on the single versions is actually adapted from a traditional New Orleans funeral march. The 12\" extended mix contains an extended arrangement of the brass section, featuring original material not found on other versions. The versions with brass instruments also include a long creaking sound of a door closing at the beginning. This sound comes from the beginning of the music video that was shot for \"Close to Me\", which features the band trapped in a wardrobe that is falling off of a cliff into an ocean. The lyrics contain the words \"If only I was sure/that my head on the door was a dream\", which inspired the title for the album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cure/_/Close+to+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The single version is a remix edit of the album version, and at 4:48 minutes is significantly shorter than the original album version which runs for 7:24. There are also 2 different remixes on 2 UK 12\" singles, and other singles released around the world, one of which later appeared on Mixed Up as the Extended Dub Mix and differs significantly from the album version in arrangement in that incorporates wholly original drum and bass arrangements. The other is an extended remix of the original album version which, at 7:59, runs slightly longer than the album version. There is also an edit which was released on 12\" in the US, titled \"extended remix\" as in the European and Australasian releases, but which runs for 6:40 rather than 7:59.\n\nAccording to interviews, the inspiration of the song came when a fire broke loose in Robert Smith's home. After that day, Robert was going through the remains and came across his wallet which had pictures of his wife, Mary. The cover of the single is one of the pictures. The same picture was used as the cover of the \"Charlotte Sometimes\" single, but this version was heavily warped and distorted.\n\nIn 2004, the song was voted 278th on Rolling Stone's \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cure/_/Pictures+of+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released as a single on April 8, 1980, and was the only single from their second album Seventeen Seconds. It was also their first chart single in the UK, reaching #34.\n\nThe lyrics tell a vague story about a man looking for a girl in a forest. He hears her calling for him, and as he chases her, he suddenly stops and realizes that he is lost and that the girl is not there. The song is fairly upbeat compared to the other material on the album, and Lol Tolhurst's machine-like steady beat together with Simon Gallup's minimalistic bassline gives this nervous chase more depth and keeps the song on the edge of a frantic groove until the end.\n\nThough not their biggest hit, it is regarded by many fans and critics as one of the best examples of The Cure's sound. The song is also notable for securing the band its first slot on BBC's \"Top of the Pops\".\n\nThe track has been re-recorded a number of times by The Cure. In 1990 the track was re-recorded and remixed as the \"Tree mix\" on the band's \"Mixed Up\" album. It was redone for the second time on the Join the Dots box set this time remixed by Mark Plati and featuring Earl Slick on guitar. Robert Smith supplied vocals for a Blank & Jones cover version in 2003. The song has also been covered by Nouvelle Vague on their first album Nouvelle Vague and by Carpathian Forest on their debut album Black Shining Leather. The song \"Dead Disco\" by the Canadian rock group Metric borrows heavily from the song. Many have said this is in reference to the group and the genre.\n\n* Robert Smith - Voice, Guitar\n* Simon Gallup - Bass\n* Matthieu Hartley - Keyboards\n* Laurence Tolhurst - Drums\n\n\nReleased - April 8, 1980 UK\nFormat - 7\", 12\"\nGenre - Gothic rock, Post-punk\nLength - 5:55\nLabel - Fiction Records\nProducer - Mike Hedges, Robert Smith <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cure/_/A+Forest\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In the UK, it was the band's ninth chart single and their fourth consecutive Top 20 hit;  while in the US it was their first single to reach the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number 99. It was a Top 20 hit in Australia and New Zealand and also charted in several European countries, increasing the popularity of the band.\n\nMusic\n\nThe song is poppy and upbeat, featuring strummed acoustic guitars under a snappy synthesizer riff, although the song's lyrical themes of aging, loss and fear do not particularly reflect the upbeat tempo of the music. It features a distinctive drum intro by Boris Williams and a bass line reminiscent of \"Dreams Never End\" by New Order. The extended version, only released on the 12\" single in North America, features quite a longer introduction to the song.\n\nTitle\n\nThe spacing and punctuation in the title of this song is widely disputed, as it varies between \"In Between Days\", \"Inbetween Days\", and \"In-Between Days\" on many official Cure releases. The single used \"In Between Days\", whereas the album The Head on the Door uses \"In Between Days\" on the back of the album cover and the record label, and \"Inbetween Days\" on the inner sleeve. However, the CD release of the album also uses \"In Between Days\" on the actual disc.\n\nThe 1986 singles compilation Standing on a Beach uses both \"In Between Days\" and \"In-Between Days\", whereas the 1990 remix album Mixed Up, the 1993 live album Show, the 2001 Greatest Hits collection and the 2004 B-sides compilation Join the Dots each use \"Inbetween Days\". The 2006 re-release of The Head on the Door uses \"Inbetween Days\" on the back of the box and the track listing in the booklet, but it uses \"In Between Days\" as the title in the lyrical portion of the book.\n\nA similar inconsistency is present with The Cure's \"Lovesong\", as it is listed as a single compound word in some instances and two separate words (\"Love Song\") in others.\n\nReleased \t15 July 1985\nFormat \t7\" and 12\" vinyl\nRecorded \t1985 at Angel Studios, London, England\nGenre \tNew wave, alternative rock\nLength \t\n\n    2:57 (7\") 4:00 (12\") \n\nLabel \tFiction\nWriter(s) \tRobert Smith\nProducer(s) \tRobert Smith (musician) <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cure/_/Inbetween+Days\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It later appeared on the album Japanese Whispers.\n\nIn the aftermath of the bleak Pornography, Robert Smith returned from a month-long detox in the Lake District to write the antithesis to what The Cure currently represented. Written as a sarcastic reflection on sexual imagery in pop music, the single was a surprise hit. It was most successful in Australia, reaching #15.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe origins of \"Let's Go to Bed\" lie in \"Temptation\", one of the demos for Pornography. The song is a relatively upbeat, guitar-driven instrumental. In August 1982, soon after Simon Gallup's departure from the band, Smith demoed a vocal version of the track, entitled \"Temptation Two\", a psychedelic piece not far removed from the Pornography album but somewhat lighter in tone. At the end of the song, Smith sings a string of wordless syllables, nearly identical to the \"doo doo doo\"s of the later song. The final version was debuted on Kid Jensen's radio show on 27 November 1982.\n\nRobert Smith has often stated that he wished its b-side, the darker \"Just One Kiss\" (also first performed during the session) was released as a single.\n\nThe song was covered by New York pop band Ivy for their 2002 album \"Guestroom\". The video for the cover features a brief appearance by The Smashing Pumpkins' James Iha, also known for his love for, and his own covers of, The Cure. Los Angeles rock band The Dreaming have also covered this song.The hook was also sampled by Rihanna in her song S&M\n\n\nReleased \t15 November 1982\nFormat \t7\", 12\"\nGenre \tNew Wave\nLength \t3:33\nLabel \tFiction Records\nProducer \tChris Parry <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cure/_/Let%27s+Go+to+Bed\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Unlike most other Cure songs of this era, the song was unexpectedly guitar-oriented, featuring no synthesizers. Upon release as a single, \"Never Enough\" topped the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart for three weeks. On the album, it is subtitled \"Big Mix\".\n\nAlthough Perry Bamonte is on the single cover and appears in the music video, he does not have a songwriting credit (as do the other four members) nor does he play on the track.\n\nThe song was re-recorded using acoustic guitars for 2001's Acoustic Hits album (contains re-recordings of songs by the band, and released as a bonus disc to Greatest Hits). The version featured is probably more notable than any other re-recording on the album because it is the only recording from the album released elsewhere, on 2010's various artists album Brit Awards 2010.\n\n\nReleased - 17 September 1990\nFormat - 7\"\nGenre - Alternative rock\nLength - 4:28\nLabel - \tFiction\nProducer(s) - Robert Smith, Dave Allen <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cure/_/Never+Enough\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was recorded at the same time as their first LP in the UK, Three Imaginary Boys (1979) but not included on the album. However it was included on the band's first US album, Boys Don't Cry (1980).\n\n\nComposer Robert Smith has said that the song \"was a short poetic attempt at condensing my impression of the key moments in L'\u00c9tranger (The Stranger) by Albert Camus\" (Cure News number 11, October 1991). The lyrics describe a shooting on a beach, in which the Arab of the title is killed by the song's narrator; in Camus' story the main character, Meursault, shoots an Arab standing on a beach after staring out at the sea and being overwhelmingly blinded by the sun, reflected on the sea, the sand and the knife the Arab was holding.\n\nThe track has a controversial history, since it has often been viewed as promoting violence against Arabs. In the US, The Cure's first compilation of singles, Standing on a Beach (1986), was packaged with a sticker advising against racist usage of the song. It saw controversy again during the Persian Gulf War and following September 11th.[1] \"Killing an Arab\" was the only single from the Three Imaginary Boys era not to be included on that album's 2004 remaster.\n\nThe song was revived in 2005, when the band performed the song at several European festivals. The lyrics, however, were changed from \"Killing an Arab\" to \"Kissing an Arab\". Smith added a whole new opening verse when the band performed it at the Royal Albert Hall, London on April 1, 2006 as \"Killing Another\". The \"killing another\" lyric has also been used during the 2007-2008 4 Tour.\n\nThis song lends two of its lines to the titles of one of The Cure's compilation albums, Standing on a Beach, and to its CD/video counterpart Staring at the Sea.\n\n\"Killing an Arab\" has been covered by Frodus on the 1995 Radiopaque compilation Give Me The Cure, featured on Melbourne band The Living End's EP It's for Your Own Good in 1996 and covered in 2004 by DJ Riton.

The song was initially released on the album Greatest Hits.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe song gets its title from the fact that Robert Smith had believed it would be the last song the band would record, and it is also an anagram of the band's name. This song is about the suicide of friend and Associates singer Billy Mackenzie in 1997.\n\n\"Cut Here\" was originally going to be the B-Side with \"Signal to Noise\" being the A-Side. This fact was confirmed in Join the Dots, with an acoustic version of \"Signal to Noise\" being intended to be on Greatest Hits before the switch. \"Signal to Noise\" was played live in The Cure's 2005 festivals because returning member Porl Thompson really liked the song. It was one of the rare B-Sides to be performed live regularly. (The last was \"The Big Hand\" in 1992.) \"Cut Here\" was played sparringly at festivals from 2001-2002 and has not been played since.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. \"Cut Here\"\n   2. \"Signal to Noise\"\n   3. \"Cut Here\" (Missing Remix)\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n    * Robert Smith: vocals, guitar, 6-string bass, keyboards\n    * Simon Gallup: bass\n    * Perry Bamonte: guitar\n    * Roger O'Donnell: keyboards\n    * Jason Cooper: drums\n\n\nReleased - October 16, 2001\nGenre - Rock\nLength - 4:10\nLabel - Fiction Records\nProducer - Robert Smith <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cure/_/Cut+Here\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Their beat-laden, dreamy sound and Julian Cope-esque rollercoaster melodies create a wall of beautiful sound. Founded in Liverpool in 1980, the band found themselves at the dawn of a new era of sound and were placed among contemporaries such as TEcho And The Bunnymen, Teardrop Explodes, The Cure and many many other edgy, poetic bands sweeping popular culture. Fast forward to 2006 as singer Ian McNabb reactivates The Icicle Works name for a series of six UK concerts in October of that year once again bringing the timeless energy and passion which culminated in the reissue of the band&#39;s debut album as both a 2-CD and limited edition 3-CD set, each featuring a wealth of bonus tracks and radio sessions. Shift to present day and the band have built further on the momentum gained.

The Cure has released 13 studio albums and have sold 27 million albums worldwide and are considered a major influence on alternative rock, goth rock and new wave music. \n\nThe Cure's full lineup history is as follows: Robert Smith (vocals, guitar 1976-present), Lol Tolhurst (drums, keyboards 1976-1989), Michael Dempsey (bass 1976-1979), Porl Thompson (guitar, keyboards 1976-1978, 1983-1992, 2005 -2010), Simon Gallup (bass, keyboards 1979-1982, 1985-present), Matthieu Hartley (keyboards 1979 -1980), Andy Anderson (drums 1983-1984), Phil Thornalley (bass 1983-1984), Boris Williams (drums 1984-1994), Roger O'Donnell (keyboards 1987 -1990, 1995-2005, 2011-present), Perry Bamonte (guitar, keyboards 1990-2005), Jason Cooper drums 1995-present) and Reeves Gabrels (guitar 2012-present)\n\nJust as the group's lineup has changed, the band's sound has evolved throughout the years, starting off as a post-punk band similar to Wire and Gang of Four before morphing into a gothic rock band in the early 80's, to a synthpop group in the mid-80's and a power-pop-alternative band in the early 90's. The Cure has always been an alternative and very independent band which was evident from the early days. Shunning the anarchistic tendencies of many punk bands after their formation in 1976 , The Cure's first release was Killing an Arab, based on material from French writer Albert Camus' \"L'Etranger\" (translated into English as The Stranger or The Outsider). This track courted controversy because of its theme (misinterpreted as racist, it was in fact, about the futility of killing any ethnicity), but it started to secure a small following, which grew following the release of debut album Three Imaginary Boys and non-LP single Boys Don't Cry in 1979, the latter of which would become one of The Cure's most famous songs.  At that time, The Cure embarked on tour as the support for Siouxsie & the Banshees' Join Hands Tour. After the sudden departure of guitarist John McKay, Robert was recruited as guitarist for the Banshees as the band 'felt he was the only person capable of taking on the task.' As a result, Robert completed the tour playing two sets a night with The Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees.\n\nFollowing this, The Cure moved from their punk leanings into the portentous post-punk territory, releasing three albums of doom-laden rock in three years, Seventeen Seconds, Faith and Pornography, the latter of which charted inside the UK top 10, though the band were repeatedly dogged by the \"Second-class Joy Division\" tag. Following their third set of line-up changes, the group released Japanese Whispers, a compilation of three singles and their b-sides. Through their desire to escape the Joy Division description, the singles were a poppier effort, featuring danceable tracks like Let's Go To Bed alongside pop songs like Love Cats. Following the commercial disappointment of follow-up album The Top in 1984, The Cure returned to form with 1985's The Head On The Door. Featuring the singles In Between Days and Close To Me, The Head on the Door was distant from the band's punk roots, having more in common with successful alternative bands like The Smiths and Echo & The Bunnymen than their gloomier roots.\n\nTwo years later, the eighth studio album Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me was a more stadium-sized effort, though featuring audacious pop songs like Why Can't I Be You, it was seemingly caught between two styles. However, it was the band's ninth effort (following the departure of last surviving founder member other than Robert Smith, Lol Tolhurst), Disintegration, that would be their greatest success, both critically and commercially. Disintegration spawned hit singles like Lullaby (no.5 in the UK), Love Song (an impressive no. 2 in the USA), Pictures of You, and Fascination Street. The album itself was a culmination of The Cure's directions through the eighties, featuring the poppier side combined with the more tender aspects, as well as the gloomier facets.\n\nFollowing this, a remix compilation named Mixed Up was released in 1990, featuring one new track, Never Enough, and two years later tenth studio album Wish surfaced, which was a hit mainly from the momentum gained by Disintegration, though it also featured their most famous pop song, Friday I'm In Love (no.6 in the UK and no.18 in the US). During the years following this, the band became distracted and discouraged by the lawsuit launched by former member Lol Tolhurst, who felt he had been deprived of royalties. As a result, the 1996 album Wild Mood Swings felt unfocused, and was a critical and commercial failure, though the single Mint Car was a moderate hit.\n\nIn 1997, The Cure released the compilation Galore, featuring new song Wrong Number. Three years later, at the release of original album Bloodflowers, Robert Smith announced it would be the last album for the band, the album itself being a return to the gloomier rock of Pornography and Faith. Resultantly, another hits compilation was released in 2001. However, in 2004, the band surprised all by returning with a self-titled album, their twelfth studio album, which was a surprise hit, reaching the US Top 10, its lead single - The End of the World  - becoming a modest hit on Modern Rock radio, and receiving a relatively warm reception from the press. \n\nIn May 2005, Smith fired Roger O'Donnell and Perry Bamonte from the band, along with Bamonte's brother Daryl, who had been The Cure's tour manager for many years. The remaining members of the band (Robert Smith, longtime bassist Simon Gallup and Jason Cooper) made a few appearances as a trio before it was announced that founding member Porl Thompson would be returning to The Cure.\n\nIn early 2007 the band toured Asia and Oceania, but a planned North American tour in Autumn 2007 was delayed until Spring 2008 so the band could continue recording their next album.\n\nThe band released their thirteenth album 4:13 Dream on 27 October 2008. Four singles and a remix EP called \"Hypnagogic States\" were releases on the 13th of each month preceding the album's release.\n\n In 2009, Robert Smith won the Godlike Genius award at the NME Awards. On April 19, 2009, the band performed at the Coachella Festival in California.\n\nDuring 2010, Robert Smith contributed songs to the soundtrack of the Tim Burton film \"Alice in Wonderland\" and provided guest vocals on the songs \"Not in Love\" by Crystal Castles and \"Come to Me\" by 65daysofstatic.\n\nBetween 31 May 2011 and 1 June 2011, the band performed three concerts at the Sydney Opera House performing the entirety of one of their first three albums on each night. Porl Thompson did not perform with the band at any of the concerts, but Roger O'Donnell performed with the band for the \"Seventeen Seconds\" and \"Faith\" concerts, and co-founding member Lol Tulhurst performed with the band for the first time since 1988 for the \"Faith\" concert. As of 2011, O'Donnell has returned to the lineup officially. In 2012, the band added former Tin Machine guitarist Reeves Gabrels to the lineup. \n\nIn 2013 The Cure started The Great Circle Tour, headlinig festivals in Japn, South Korea and North America. In 2014 Robert Smith announced the upcoming release of a new album, to be called 4:14 Scream, featuring 14 songs recorded during the 4:13 Dream sessions and also an accompanying double album 4:26 Dream containing all the tracks from those sessions.\n\nThe Cure official website: www.thecure.com\nThe Cure official Myspace: http://www.myspace.com/thecure\nThe Cure on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#/thecure?ref=ts\nThe Cure - Disintegration Microsite: http://www.thecuredisintegration.com/bin/thecure <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Cure\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

All Rights go to Frank Ocean and their respectful owners."}, "description": "\"Thinkin Bout You\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Frank Ocean, released as the lead single from his debut studio album Channel Orange (2012). The song was written by Ocean and produced by Shea Taylor. Originally to be featured on Bridget Kelly's debut album, Ocean released his original version of the track for free on his tumblr. In May of 2012, the song was officially sent to radio and released onto iTunes as a single by Ocean. Kelly would later release her own version of the track entitled \"Thinking Bout Forever\".\n\nLyrically, the track is about a relationship just out of his reach and the turmoil that ensues. The track also explores feelings of regret and heartbreak. The song received highly positive reviews from music critics, who praised the atmospheric production, Ocean's falsetto and writing ability. Some critics noted the possible bisexual undertones featured on the track (as stated above, however, the song was initially intended as a demo version of a song for a female singer, Bridget Kelly). Complex magazine named it the fourth best track of 2011.\n\nIn September 2012, the song peaked at position 32 on the Billboard Hot 100, 117 on the UK Singles Chart, and 13 on the Heatseekers Songs chart. In 2011, the song received a music video directed by visual art group High5Collective released on September 15. Ocean appears in the violent clip revolving around an inter-dimensional love story and zombies. Ocean performed the track during his seven-show tour through North America and Europe in November 2011, at the April 2012 Coachella Musical Festival, and his supporting tour for Channel Orange. \"Thinkin Bout You\" has been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, for shipments of 500,000 copies in the United States. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Ocean/_/Thinkin+Bout+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released as the lead single from his mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra. The song was written by Ocean, Tricky Stewart and Victor Alexander, and produced by Stewart. Lyrically, the song narrates a tale of a young female dental student who makes a living doing porn and who recreationally uses local anesthetic drugs that she acquires from her place of study. The song explores themes of isolation, loneliness and a lack of feeling caused by numbness. The song received highly positive reviews from music critics and was listed as one of the best songs of the year by publications such as The New York Times, Spin, Ology, Zimbio and Pitchfork Media. Reviews praised the dark subject matter of the song, and praised Ocean's ability to create narratives and the sonic atmosphere of the track.\n\nWhen Nostalgia, Ultra was expected to be released as an EP by Def Jam, \"Novacane\" was released as the first single, though the EP release was later cancelled. The song peaked at number 82 on the Billboard Hot 100 and entered the top 10 on the Heatseekers Songs chart. The song received a music video directed by Australian director Nabil Elderkin released on June 16. The highly stylized video shows a long take of Ocean sitting around in a darkly lit room. Ocean performed the song during a show in New York with alternative hip hop group OFWGKTA, and during his seven show tour through North America and Europe. It was also performed during his 14 show Channel Orange tour through North America.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Ocean/_/Novacane\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The track features two competing voices, adding a sense of tension and conflict to the otherwise dreamy music. The lyrics include cultural references to the late A$AP Yams (who is featured in the video along with A$AP Rocky), Pimp C, and Trayvon Martin. \n\nThe song is the lead single from Frank Ocean\u2019s highly anticipated third album, Blonde, originally titled Boys Don\u2019t Cry. It was released the day after his visual album Endless on Apple Music. The video is highly stylized and features race cars, nudity, immolation, partying and a devil. The video contains scenes of a party, which is later revealed to be staged for a film crew. Frank Ocean appears on a stage in the video, and begins singing when the voices switch. \n\nThe song was first teased by Chance the Rapper, who was rumored to collaborate on the album.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Ocean/_/Nikes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He was born Christopher Edwin Breaux in Long Beach, California. He has helped pen tracks for Justin Bieber, John Legend, Brandy, and Beyonce Knowles over the last few years. In 2011, Ocean released his debut mixtape, Nostalgia, Ultra, for free via his Tumblr.\n\nVenting about his decision to drop the record his own way, he took to Twitter on March 1, 2011: \"i. did. this. not ISLAND DEF JAM. that's why you see no label logo on the artwork that I DID. guess its my fault for trusting my dumbass lawyer and signing my career over to a failing company. fuck Def Jam & any company that goes the length of signing a kid with dreams & talent w/ no intention of following through. fuck em. now back to my day. i want some oatmeal and toast. brunch swag.\"\n\nAs a member of the Odd Future (OFWGKTA)  collective, his sound is distinctively soulful/r&b influenced, yet done in a way that could pass for something totally different. As Tyler, the Creator states, \u201cIt\u2019s Smooth Ass Music About Bitches, Relationships And Being A Rich Young Nigga\u2026But In A Swagged Out Way.\u201d \n\nOcean was evacuated from the University of New Orleans to Los Angeles, California just as Hurricane Katrina hit in August 2005, and stayed in Los Angeles to pursue a music career. Ocean joined Los Angeles based collective OFWGKTA, who he met through mutual friends, at the end of 2009. In the end of 2009, he met Tricky Stewart, who helped Ocean sign a contract with Def Jam Recordings as an artist, however, he was initially unable to build a relationship with the company. In 2010, he changed his name from Christopher \"Lonny\" Breaux to Christopher Francis Ocean via a legal website. In an April 2011 interview, Ocean intimated that his relationship with Def Jam has strengthened since the release of his mixtape. On April 28, 2011, Ocean was arrested on unspecified charges by the LAPD, and was released on the morning after on April 29, 2011. Ocean joined his OFWGKTA bandmates for the first time on tour from May 12 to May 19, 2011. On May 31, 2011, Def Jam released the single Novacane on iTunes soon followed by Swim Good Taken from his mixtape Nostalgia, ULTRA.

It serves as the second single from her fifth studio album of the same name (2015). The song was released on September 18, 2015, by Hollywood and Island Records for download on digital retail sites such as Amazon.com. It was written by Lovato, Max Martin, Ilya Salmanzadeh, and Savan Kotecha. Commercially, it has reached the top 30 in Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, New Zealand, Scotland, and the United States.\nThe music video for \"Confident\" was released on October 9, 2015 through Lovato's Vevo channel. The video was directed by Robert Rodriguez, who is known for Sin City, Machete and the Spy Kids franchise. The video stars Lovato as well as Michelle Rodriguez, Jeff Fahey, Zane Holtz and Marko Zaror. It was shot at Troublemaker Studios in Austin, Texas. Lovato had asked Robert Rodriguez to direct the music video after meeting him through her role as Maia in From Dusk till Dawn: The Series. Rodriguez stated: \u201cI wanted it to look like a movie, not like a vamped up, over-the-top music video or a movie in a video, but actually something that looked like it was from a spy film. I felt it was this great culmination of movie, ideas and visuals all put together into this song created by Demi Lovato.\u201d\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Demi+Lovato/_/Confident\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

She co-wrote the track with Simon Wilcox and its producer, Sir Nolan. It was initially released exclusively to music streaming services through Island, Hollywood and Safehouse Records on July 1, 2016, was serviced to pop radio on July 12, 2016, and was made available to iTunes on July 15, 2016. \"Body Say\" is a dance ballad with an R&B beat, and explores themes of sexuality and self-confidence. Lovato co-wrote the track with Simon Wilcox and its producer Sir Nolan. The song employs \"slinky\", synth-y \"bedroom beats\" behind lyrics, which Zach Johnson of E! News deemed \"sexier\" than her past single, \"Cool for the Summer\", that discuss all the things Lovato would do to a lover if her \"body had a say.\" Critics have also made note of the sexual nature of the song given Lovato's recent (at the time of the song's release) breakup with long-term boyfriend, Wilmer Valderrama. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Demi+Lovato/_/Body+Say\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In 2002, she made her debut as child actress in Barney & Friends. In 2008, she came to prominence as a starring cast member in the television film Camp Rock. She signed to Hollywood Records the same year, and released her debut studio album, Don't Forget, in September 2008. The album sold 89,000 copies within its first week, debuting at number 2 on the Billboard 200 It has since been certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over 530,000. In 2009, Lovato was commissioned her own television series, Sonny with a Chance. That July, her second album, Here We Go Again, became her first to debut atop the U.S. Billboard 200, selling 108,000 copies in its first week and spawning the single of the same name which became her first to break the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 15.\nAfter the release of additional television films and their accompanying soundtracks in 2010, Lovato's personal struggles sent her acting career into hiatus, and saw the closure of her television show Sonny with a Chance after its second season. She released her third album, Unbroken, in September 2011. The album addresses several of her difficulties, notably her lead single \"Skyscraper\" which became her first single to be certified platinum by the RIAA. The second single, \"Give Your Heart a Break\", was later certified double-platinum in the United States. The album had been certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. Since 2012, Lovato has served as a judge and mentor on the American version of The X Factor. She released fourth album, Demi, in May 2013 to critical success, selling 110,000 copies within its first week, becoming her highest opening week to date. The album was preceded by its lead single, \"Heart Attack\", that February and was certified double-platinum by the RIAA. In September 2013, Lovato announced plans to go on a North American leg of her third headlining concert tour, The Neon Lights Tour in promotion of her fourth studio album Demi.\nThroughout her music career, Lovato has embarked on several concert tours. In 2008, she served as the opening act for the Jonas Brothers' Burnin' Up Tour and Avril Lavigne's Best Damn Tour. Later that year, she embarked on her first promotional tour, the Demi Live! Warm Up Tour. Since then she has held two headlining concert tours, Demi Lovato: Live in Concert and A Special Night with Demi Lovato. Her work has additionally earned several accolades, including one MTV Video Music Award, twenty five Teen Choice Awards nominations, eleven of which she has won, four People's Choice Awards, one ALMA award, a Billboard Touring Award and several others. In 2013, Maxim ranked her 26th on their Hot 100 while Billboard ranked her second on their Social 50 Artists of the Year. Outside of her work in the entertainment industry, Lovato is involved in philanthropic activities through charity work and various social and environmental causes. In May 2013, she was awarded for her dedication as a mentor to teens and young adults with mental health challenges at a National Children's Mental Health Awareness Day hosted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in Washington. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Demi+Lovato\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was included on Wonder's Talking Book album and released as a single in many countries. It reached number one in the USA, and number eleven in the UK, in February 1973.\n\nWonder had actually written this song for Jeff Beck, but at the insistence of his own manager, Wonder himself recorded it first. Beck was instead offered \"Cause We've Ended As Lovers\", which he recorded for 1975's Blow by Blow. Jeff Beck played guitar on Talking Book and later recorded his own version of \"Superstition\" with Beck, Bogert & Appice.\n\nWonder's music had been undergoing a marked change from his earlier Motown pop to a more personal style. This shift had been evident on his two prior albums, but it was Talking Book, and \"Superstition\" in particular that brought the new style to the awareness of the public in general.\n\nThe song deals with superstitions, and mentions several popular fables in its lyrics.\n\n\"Superstition\" is immediately recognizable for its opening drum beat, which was performed by Wonder, and for its notably funky clavinet riff. The song also heavily features brass instruments and saxophones, notably a trumpet lead by Trevor Laurence, and the electronic Arp and Moog synthesizer sounds that Malcolm Cecil and Robert Margouleff helped to create for the album.\n\nWonder performed \"Superstition\" on the children's television show Sesame Street in 1972, as well as on Soul Train and WNET's Soul. The song also featured in a series of commercials for Levi's jeans, broadcast in the United States in late 2006.\n\nThe song was featured in a scene of John Carpenter's The Thing. T.K. Carter's character, Nauls, listens to it on a boom box in the kitchen, defiantly turning up the volume when he is asked to turn it down. It was featured in the end credits of Wes Craven's Vampire In Brooklyn and also in the movie I, Robot starring Will Smith where Smith's character plays it after waking up.\n\nThe song has also been covered by Melvin Van Peebles, Raven-Symone, and Stevie Ray Vaughan. (Vaughan and Wonder had mutual admiration for one another; Wonder would later write the song \"Stevie Ray Blues\" in honor of Vaughan). Bucky Covington covered the song on the fifth season of American Idol, and his version was included on the CD. The song is also covered by Widespread Panic along with the Dirty Dozen Brass Band on Panic's 2000 release Another Joyous Occasion. The song was also mixed by Alicia Keys in the song \"Karma (Karmastition Remix)\".\n\nIn November 2004, Rolling Stone ranked Superstition at #74 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Stevie+Wonder/_/Superstition\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It also reached #1 in the United World Chart.\n\nThe song was written about Duke Ellington, the great jazz artist who influenced Wonder's style. Ellington died in 1974 and the song was a tribute. The lyrics also refer to Count Basie, Glenn Miller, Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nThe artists, apart from Stevie Wonder, who perform on the original version were: Raymond Pounds (drums), Nathan Watts (bass), Mike Sembello (lead guitar), Ben Bridges (rhythm guitar), Hank Redd (alto saxophone), Trevor Laurence (tenor saxophone), Raymond Maldonado (trumpet), and Steve Madaio (trumpet).\n\nWonder rerecorded the song for the live album Natural Wonder.\n\nIn the early to mid-1990s, \"Sir Duke\" was played during the NBA's New York Knicks games at Madison Square Garden.\n\n\"Sir Duke\" is featured in the Derrick Comedy sketch \"Progressions of a Mad Hatter\".\n\n\"Sir Duke\" was also played at the 2004 Democratic National Convention after the Presidential nomination acceptance speech of John Kerry and John Edwards. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Stevie+Wonder/_/Sir+Duke\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Most would probably remember him from recordings he made in the early 90s under his previous moniker \u201cLennox\u201d, most notably the double-A side \u201cDon\u2019t Go\u201d/\u201dFree\u201d; two slices of sensual and conscious UK Soul respectively. In recent times Lex can be found in the guise of Musical Director, vocalist/composer and keyboard player for none other than Mr Omar Lye-Fook on the tour circuit, as well as preparing subtly in the background for his own solo comeback. \u00a0 Janette Mason - Musical Director & Piano Even if you\u2019ve never been to this exceptional pianist\u2019s gigs, you\u2019ll have heard her special touch time and again - on many albums from Ian Shaw to Robert Wyatt, live in concert with Oasis and Jimmy Somerville as well as her numerous contributions for television and soundtracks for the movies.

Stevland Hardaway Judkins, 13 May 1950 in Saginaw, MI, USA - a.k.a. Little Stevie Wonder), a singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer and activist.  He d\u00e9buted, as Little Stevie Wonder, with the single \"I Call It Pretty Music, But the Old People Call It the Blues\" (1961, Tamla Motown) and his latest album is \"A Time 2 Love\" (Oct 2005, Motown)\n\nStevland lost his eyesight shortly after birth. When he was four, his mother left his father, and moved with the children to Detroit.  She changed her name back to Lula Hardaway and later changed her son's surname to Morris, partly for family reasons. Stevland Morris has remained Stevie Wonder's legal name ever since.\n\nWonder signed with Motown's Tamla label at the age of eleven, and continues to perform and record for Motown to this day. Altogether, he has released more than thirty U.S. Top 10 hits and received twenty-two Grammy Awards, the most ever awarded to a male solo artist. In 2008, Billboard magazine placed Wonder fifth in their list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists. He has recorded numerous critically and commercially successful albums, as well as hit singles. Since the mid-1960s, he has written and produced songs for some of his labelmates (such as Smokey Robinson and the Miracles and The Spinners), as well as outside artists like Michael Jackson. A multi-instrumentalist, Wonder plays drums, guitar, synthesizers, congas, and most famously the piano, harmonica, and keyboards. \n\nWonder forged his divergent styles into a trademark sound, putting his musical signature on a quartet of albums that would change music forever: 1972's Talking Book, 1973's Innervisions, 1974's Fullfillingness' First Finale, and 1976's Songs in the Key of Life. By the end of the decade, Wonder had won a record fifteen Grammys, as well as numerous other awards.\n\nIn the following decades he wrote, among other classics, his 1982 collaboration with Paul McCartney, \"Ebony and Ivory,\" which remained number one for seven weeks in a row. 1984's The Woman in Red soundtrack produced the enduring classic \"I Just Called to Say I Love You,\" yet another number-one hit that gained him an Academy Award.\n\nIn 1989 Wonder was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame alongside The Rolling Stones. \n\nHis contribution to worldwide social and political change is just as impressive. He championed the effort to make Martin Luther King's birthday a national holiday, as well as becoming a driving force behind 1985's USA for Africa campaign, and being visible in U.S. musicians' fight against apartheid in South Africa. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Stevie+Wonder\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released October 13, 2008.\n\nAccording to the Kids Songfacts, the  song is about being filled with such typical college feelings as naivety, idealism, nostalgia, happiness and sadness . \n\nKids has been re-recorded several times.  The \"newer\" version that appears on Oracular Spectacular is updated from earlier versions that appear on Time to Pretend EP released in  2005 and We (don't) Care released a year before. A track entitled Kids (Afterschool Dance Megamix) appears on the album Climbing to New Lows also released in 2005.\n\nTo date, the single has peaked at #9 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, where Time to Pretend had previously peaked at #23.\nNME named it the number-one song on its list of the Best Singles of 2008.\nTwo months after exiting the UK Top 40, the song was featured in an advertisement for the BBC1 program Waterloo Road. From this the song gained renewed interest, re-entering the UK Top 40, and on January 16, 2009, the song reached its highest position to date of #16.\nKids also came in at #5 on Australia's Triple J Hottest 100 countdown for 2008.\nThe single received considerable airplay in the U.S., UK, Ireland and Australia before the release date, charting in the UK, Ireland and Australia. In Australia, Kids debuted before the release date at #89, and currently it has peaked at #30. Kids (Soulwax Remix), a Soulwax remix of the song was played heavily on UK radio ahead its official release as well.\nThe song got to the number one spot on the Norwegian chart, based on downloads alone. This made some controversy about how reliable the chart was, as the song had not been playlisted on any major radio stations and it disappeared from the chart the next week.\n\nTo date, Kids has featured in multiple media. It was included in soundtrack for the videogames \"FIFA 09\" and \"Shaun White Snowboarding\". It made appearances in films such as \"That's It, That's All\", \"American Teen\" and \"Stranger Than Fiction\". As well as featuring in several TV shows and series like, \"Survivors\", \"Paris Hilton's British Best Friend\", \"Waterloo Road\", \"The Real Hustle\" and \"The Vampire Diaries\".\n\nAn acoustic version of Kids was recorded by The Kooks in August 2008, to appear on the next volume of Triple J's cover compilation Like a Version. Another acoustic version by Australian singer Ben Lee appears on the bonus CD from his 2009 album The Rebirth of Venus. The song has also been covered live by Weezer, Jack's Mannequin, Our Lady Peace and VIC. Matt Hires has also covered the song in some of his live shows, as well as Swedish indie rockband Vinklad. \n\nMGMT was involved in a legal dispute with the President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy. Sarkozy's UMP party used the song on several occasions, before offering the band a \u20ac1 gesture. Eventually, UMP reached an agreement on a \u20ac30,000 ($39,000) settlement fee. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/MGMT/_/Kids\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

birds,\nTorment ignites essence, delights from the earth\nWhat you find shocking\nThey find amusing,\nSomething else to soften a sadistic urge\nWhen they tell you the extent of the vice\nThen the prime time mission is to choke the statistician,\nAnd like the senses that you're lurking behind\nWhile it gnaws right through to your core,\nOh I'd twist it more\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you think that you're free (Free like a kite)\nWatching as it flies by (Spy the unknown)\nFocus on the quiet oars\nTell me how far you'd go (Go where you like)\nKnowing your air won't last (Last one to know)\nWould you feel better holding the stars up?\n\nWhat if the beast escapes (apes have it good)\nAnd separates like a cloud (loud like a fault),\nSeeps into the hollow bones?\nWouldn't its eyes expand\nAnd zero in

Die jahrelange Wartezeit ist vor\u00fcber. Am 17. Oktober stellten MGMT ihre wirklich hei\u00df ersehnte neue Single online. Nach vielen Ank\u00fcndigungen und Versprechungen und viereinhalb Jahre nach der letzten Ver\u00f6ffentlichung war es endlich soweit: Mit \u201eLittle Dark Age\u201c erschien der Vorbote der gleichnamigen f\u00fcnften Platte, und er ist der Knaller. \u201eMGMT are goth now\u201c, urteilte das Fachblatt Spin auch in Bezug auf das Steampunk-BDSM-Video, in dem die Band nichts Geringeres wagt als ein T\u00e4nzchen mit dem Tod pers\u00f6nlich. Die Musik dazu l\u00e4dt jedenfalls so richtig dazu ein. Mit diesem etwas d\u00fcster-wavigen Track im Midtempo erschlie\u00dft sich MGMT ein neues Feld.<p>Welch\u2019 weiten Weg hat diese Band nicht schon zur\u00fcckgelegt, seit sie als experimentelle Elektroclash-Pioniere noch unter dem Namen The Management angefangen haben. Die Markenzeichen der Masterminds Andrew VanWyngarden und Ben Goldwasser sind auch in diesem neuen St\u00fcck unverkennbar: Der Synthie-Sound, der so intelligent wie catchy daherkommt, die Art, Pop mit psychedelischen und elektronischen Elementen zu schaffen, und die Boshaftigkeit, mit der die fragile und vordergr\u00fcndige Leichtigkeit in 1000 Scherben zerbricht, sobald man genauer hinh\u00f6rt. Kein Wunder also, dass MGMT sp\u00e4testens seit ihrem zweiten Album \u201eCongratulations\u201c als eine der einflussreichsten Bands \u00fcberhaupt gilt und als eine, die den Eklektizismus zur perfekten Kunstform erhoben hat. Jetzt also sind die New Yorker mit neuem Material am Start und wollen die Welt auch live mit ihrem einzigartigen Sound verz\u00fccken.<p>Ende Januar spielen MGMT eine exklusive Show im Berliner Huxleys.</p></p></p></p>", "title": "MGMT + Molly Nilsson", "url": "http://berlin.eventful.com/events/mgmt-molly-nilsson-/E0-001-109367243-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "Germany", "venue": "Huxley's Neue Welt", "date": "2018-01-30 20:00:00"}, {"city": "Bruxelles", "description": null, "title": "MGMT", "url": "http://brussels.eventful.com/events/mgmt-/E0-001-109391038-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "Belgium", "venue": "Ancienne Belgique", "date": "2018-02-03 20:00:00"}, {"city": "Brixton", "description": " <strong>Customers have to be over 14 years of age to attend this event.</strong> ", "title": "MGMT", "url": "http://london.eventful.com/events/mgmt-/E0-001-109421054-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United Kingdom", "venue": "Electric Brixton", "date": "2018-02-06 00:00:00"}, {"city": "Paris", "description": " \n", "title": "MGMT", "url": "http://paris.eventful.com/events/mgmt-/E0-001-109716657-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "France", "venue": "La Cigale", "date": "2018-02-05 19:30:00"}, {"city": "Amsterdam", "description": " \n", "title": "MGMT", "url": "http://amsterdam.eventful.com/events/mgmt-/E0-001-109421052-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "Netherlands", "venue": "Paradiso", "date": "2018-02-02 20:30:00"}, {"city": "Milan", "description": " \n", "title": "Justice & MGMT - Milano Summer Festival 2018", "url": "http://eventful.com/milan/events/justice-mgmt-milano-summer-festival-2018-/E0-001-110115236-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "Italy", "venue": "Ippodromo del Galoppo", "date": "2018-07-17 00:00:00"}, {"city": "West Lafayette", "description": " Hospitality And Tourism Mgmt Career Day is happening on 25 Sep 2018 at Purdue University West Lafayette, United States Of America.

It was the first single and second track from their third album, Songs for the Deaf, and was released on November 26, 2002. \"No One Knows\" was a chart success, becoming the band's only single to top the US Modern Rock charts. The song was also critically acclaimed, receiving a nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 2003 Grammy Awards.\n\nAccording to Homme, \"No One Knows\" existed before the recording sessions for Songs for the Deaf:\n\n    We have patience with music, a year or five years down the road it may kind of rewrite itself and become what it's supposed to be. There's two songs on this record that are over five years old, you know? 'God is the Radio' and 'No One Knows'.\n\nThe main guitar riff of the song originally appeared on the track \"Cold Sore Superstars\" from Can You See Under My Thumb? There You Are, the seventh volume of Homme side-project The Desert Sessions. Recording for Songs for the Deaf began in March 2002 at three studios across California. Though the liner notes credit Homme and Eric Valentine with producing the majority of the album \u2013 including \"No One Knows\" \u2013 Homme credits Valentine with merely recording the beginning of the album for contractual reasons, and departing the project to leave recording and producing duties to the band and Adam Kasper.\n\nThe critical response to \"No One Knows\" was generally positive. In The Guardian review of the album, reviewer Dave Simpson, said of the song in his four star review of Songs for the Deaf \"No One Knows has killer riffs to spare\". Playlouder were similarly enthused, calling the song \"soulful, like the last gasp of the hero in an old western\". Eric Carr of Pitchfork called it an \"easy groove\" and \"four-to-the-floor slime of the highest quality\".\n\n\"No One Knows\" was awarded the number one position on Australian national radio station Triple J's annual Hottest 100 2002, with four other Queens of the Stone Age tracks also charting. The March 2005 edition of Q magazine placed it at number 70 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks saying of the song \"Possibly the only full-on, legs akimbo guitar great to be based around a rhythm that goes oompah-oompah, here Josh Homme joined the ranks of the immortal\". In September 2006, it was placed at number 13 on NME's list of the 50 Greatest Tracks Of The Decade. Rolling Stone placed \"No One Knows\" at number 97 on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time saying of the track \"QOTSA guitarist and overall mastermind Josh Homme found the sweet spot between hooky hard rock and the pulverizing metal he'd grown up playing\". The song was listed at number eleven on the 2002 Pazz & Jop list, a survey of several hundred music critics conducted by Robert Christgau. \"No One Knows\" was nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 2003 Grammys and was the band's first, but they lost out on the award to Foo Fighters for \"All My Life\".\n\n\"No One Knows\" was released as a single on November 26, 2002 and became the most successful single from Songs for the Deaf. The song's peak placings of number one, number five and number 51 on the US Modern Rock, US Mainstream Rock (where it lasted for twenty weeks) and the Billboard Hot 100 charts respectively remain the highest of the band's career. \"No One Knows\" is also the band's highest charting single on the Dutch Singles Chart, number 39, the Irish Singles Chart, number 26, and the UK Singles Chart, number 15.\n\nThe music video for \"No One Knows\" was directed by Dean Karr and Michel Gondry; Gondry filmed the first half on June 26 and 27, 2002, with Karr taking over on July 15. Josh Homme has said Gondry was chosen because he \"did all those videos for Bj\u00f6rk and we're huge fans of Bj\u00f6rk, so we're excited\".\n\nThe video is split into two sections and switches between them throughout. The first sees band members Homme, Nick Oliveri and Mark Lanegan driving a truck at night, whereupon they hit a deer. When they get out to inspect, the deer proceeds to attack them before going on a rampage in their truck. The second section of the video is of Homme, Oliveri, Troy Van Leeuwen and Dave Grohl performing the song against a black background.\n\n\"No One Knows\" received heavy rotation on music video channels culminating in a nomination for the MTV2 Award at 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, where it lost out to AFI for \"Girl's Not Grey\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queens+of+the+Stone+Age/_/No+One+Knows\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Gibbons does not regularly tour with the band, so the other vocal was performed by Lanegan, until he stopped touring with the band. Currently, Josh Homme sings alone with backing vocals from the rest of the band, who lack either of the studio musicians' deep growls. In the previous line-up, Homme played bass and Alain Johannes played a quite different version of Gibbons' solo.

The band is frequently labeled stoner rock, although they reject the label. They developed a style of riff-oriented, heavy music which the band's founder and mastermind Josh Homme described as \"robot rock\", saying that he \"wanted to create a heavy sound based on a solid jam, just pound it into your head\". Since then, their sound has evolved to incorporate a variety of different styles and influences.\n\nWhile in high school, Homme got together with locals Brant Bjork, Chris Cockrell (later replaced by Nick Oliveri) and John Garcia resulting in the formation of Kyuss (firstly known as \"Sons of Kyuss\"). Queens of the Stone Age formed in 1997, rising from the ashes of Kyuss and began playing together during the now legendary Desert Sessions. Homme has drawn all of the members from that diverse group of musicians for Queens of the Stone Age. The band originally formed under the name Gamma Ray, but almost faced a lawsuit from the European metal band of the same name.\n\nQueens of the Stone Age have gone through many line-up changes since first breaking into the hard rock scene. Their most recent line-up includes: Josh Homme (guitar, vocals), Troy Van Leeuwen (guitar, lap steel, keyboards, backing vocals), Jon Theodore (drums, percussion), Michael Shuman (bass, backing vocals), and Dean Fertita (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals).\n\nFormer core members include Joey Castillo, Alain Johannes, Natasha Shneider, Mark Lanegan, and Nick Oliveri, among other members and contributors. In 2002, regarding the band line-up, Homme said: \"It really is more of a musical experiment\u2026 It keeps moving and reinventing itself. That way we never get painted into a corner.\"\n\nDave Grohl recorded drums, percussion and backing vocals on Songs for the Deaf and toured in support of the album in 2002 before returning to the Foo Fighters. Grohl also made a live appearance in 2007, to play Make It wit Chu, and recorded tracks on \u2026Like Clockwork, following Joey Castillo's departure.\n\nMark Lanegan has long been an on/off vocalist for the band, toured from 2001 to 2005 and made live appearances in 2007 and 2010. He has recorded with the band on all albums except for their self-titled debut album. Lanegan has also played keyboards in live performances during the tour preceding the release of Lullabies to Paralyze, before Natasha Shneider joined the band.\n\nJosh Homme and Nick Oliveri  were seen as the only two consistent Queens of the Stone Age members. Oliveri had previously played alongside Homme in the band Kyuss and joined Queens of the Stone Age as its permanent bass guitarist and co-lead vocalist, in 1998, upon the release of its debut album, Queens of the Stone Age. Being friends since childhood, the two meshed well together. Oliveri's punk background brought an element of danger and attitude to the Queens' live shows.  As the band's two core members, the duo recorded the breakthrough albums, Rated R and Songs for the Deaf, together. Oliveri's unique \"howling\" singing style made him easily distinguishable on songs such as Six Shooter from the album Songs for the Deaf; he also displays a more melodic singing style in Rated R songs such as Auto Pilot.\n\nHowever, Homme fired Oliveri in 2004 for excessive partying and an alleged incident of domestic abuse (an accusation which Oliveri strongly denies). The duo repaired their friendship shortly afterwards. Oliveri, however, did not return to the band. In 2013, upon hearing that former contributor Dave Grohl was recording drums for the band's sixth studio album, \u2026Like Clockwork, Oliveri asked Homme if he too could return on bass guitar. Homme ultimately did not grant Oliveri's request. He does, however, appear on backing vocals on the album track, If I Had a Tail.\n\nDiskographie:\n\n1997 - Kyuss / Queens of the Stone Age\n1998 - Queens of the Stone Age / Beaver Split\n1998 - Queens of the Stone Age\n2000 - Rated R\n2002 - Songs for the Deaf\n2002 - Sample This School Boy\n2002 - 2002-10-29: Rock City, Nottingham, UK\n2002 - 2002-11-06: Stockholm, Sweden\n2003 - Songs For The Deaf Tour Edition \n2004 - Stone Age Complication\n2005 - Lullabies to Paralyze\n2005 - Lullabies To Paralize Tour Edition\n2005 - MTV Unplugged (Berlin 2005-06-10)\n2005 - Over the Years and Through the Woods\n2006 - 2005-12-20: Los Angeles, CA, USA\n2006 - Over The Years And Through The Woods\n2007 - The Definitive Collection Of B-sides & Rarities\n2007 - Era Vulgaris\n2008 - Era Vulgaris Tour Edition\n2013 - ...Like Clockwork\n2017 - Villains\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Queens+of+the+Stone+Age\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released as a single in the same year, and reached number three in the U.S. Billboard charts, and number six in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone magazine voted \"Imagine\" the third greatest song of all time. Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter said, \"In many countries around the world \u2014 my wife and I have visited about 125 countries \u2014 you hear John Lennon's song 'Imagine' used almost equally with national anthems.\"\n\nIn the book Lennon in America, written by Geoffrey Giuliano, Lennon commented that the song was \"an anti-religious, anti-nationalistic, anti-conventional, anti-capitalistic song, but because it's sugar-coated, it's accepted.\" Lennon also commented, it's \"virtually the Communist Manifesto, even though I am not particularly a communist and I do not belong to any movement.\"\n\nThe lyrics were thought to be inspired by Lennon's hopes for a more peaceful world, though their origins are not known for certain. In 1963 Lennon penned the lyrics to \"I'll Get You\" with an opening verse of, \"Imagine I'm in love with you, it's easy cause I know.\" The first verse of \"Imagine\" would seem to be a reworking of this. But the song's refrain may have been partly inspired by Yoko Ono's poetry, in reaction to her childhood in Japan during World War II. According to The Guardian, primordial versions of the song's refrain can be found in her 1965 book Grapefruit, where she penned lines such as, \"imagine a raindrop\" and \"imagine the clouds dripping.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon/_/Imagine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The B-side of the single is Ono's song \"Beautiful Boys\". The single debuted at #3 in the UK, then moving to #2 and finally reaching #1, where it spent two weeks, knocking off the top spot his own re-released \"Imagine\". In the US the single spent three weeks at #2. The single was also a commercial success in New Zealand where it spent 5 weeks at #1. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon/_/Woman\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Available on Amazon: http://bit.ly/JLbox & iTunes http://bit.ly/JLboxi Video..."}, "description": "Jealous Guy is a song written and performed by John Lennon which first appeared on his 1971 album \"Imagine.\" It is one of the most commonly covered Lennon songs, with at least ninety-two recorded cover versions by musicians like Donny Hathaway, the Black Crowes, Jeff Tweedy, Peter Criss (of KISS), and Deftones.\n\nThe song's genesis came in India, after The Beatles attended a lecture by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi about a \"son of the mother nature\". This inspired both Paul McCartney and John Lennon to write songs about the same subject. McCartney's composition \"Mother Nature's Son\" was selected for The Beatles (the White Album), while Lennon's song \"Child of Nature\" was not. After that, Lennon continued to play it into the Get Back sessions. Eventually, the lyrics were scrapped and replaced by the now well known \"Jealous Guy\" lyrics for Imagine.\n\nAccording to the Jealous Guy Songfacts, Joey Molland and Tom Evans of the band Badfinger  both played acoustic guitar on this track. Badfinger were signed to the Beatles-run Apple label and George Harrison recommended to Lennon, \"if you need some guitar players on Imagine, use the Badfinger guys.\"\n\n\"Jealous Guy\" was released as a single with \"Going Down on Love\" (a track from Walls and Bridges) as the B-side in the United Kingdom in November 1985. It reached number 65 in the charts.\n\nA promotional video was made for the song in 1971. It showed, mostly in a continuous overhead shot by helicopter, John and Yoko travelling in a hearse from their Tittenhurst Park mansion to a nearby lake, where they were then shown hopping into a rowing boat.\n\nAlthough self-explanatory, the subject of the song is John Lennon not only apologizing to Yoko Ono for his jealousy, but also to explain it away by saying \"That's how I am.\" The lyrics at the end reflect this: \"I'm just a jealous guy - watch out / look out\".\n\nThough the relationship between John and Yoko is regarded by many as one of the greatest publicized romances of the 20th century, there was a period in the early 1970s, after The Beatles split, where John became entangled in a self-destructive downwards spiral. His drinking became more frequent and his relationship with Yoko became strained. It was during this period that John reworked \"Child of Nature\" to be \"Jealous Guy\" as a public apology.\n\nJohn had jealousy problems with his first wife, Cynthia Powell, and when he left her for Yoko, the jealousy continued. Yoko commented, \"The song said it all!  After we got together he made me write out a list of all the men I'd slept with before we met. I started to do it quite casually \u2013 then I realized how serious it was to John. He didn't even like me speaking Japanese because that was a part of my mind that shut him out.\"\n\nFollowing Lennon's death in 1980, Roxy Music recorded a cover version of the song, this attracted some criticism at the time as it was suggested that they were cashing in on the success of Lennon's work following his death. \n\nIn 1977, John sat in the presidential suite of the Okura Hotel in Tokyo and began singing and playing his old songs with his acoustic guitar. The gigantic hotel suite had lifts that arrived straight into the Lennon lounge. As John was playing \"Jealous Guy\" to himself, the lift doors opened and a Japanese couple, who had arrived on the wrong floor walked out. They sat and listened as John continued the song. When the song ended, they seemed displeased and went back down the elevator. Little did any of them know it, but this was to be John's last ever 'public' performance. They were the last two members of the general public to ever watch John Lennon perform a song.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon/_/Jealous+Guy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song appears to tell the story of someone growing up in the working class of capitalism. According to Lennon in an interview with Jann S. Wenner of Rolling Stone magazine in December 1970, it is about working class individuals being processed into the middle classes, into the machine.  Lennon stated (in the same interview) that he hoped that it was a warning to the people, a contemporary song for the revolution, for workers, thematically like Give Peace a Chance , aimed to replace the older songs like \"We Shall Overcome\".\n\nNotable Covers:\n\n# Tommy Roe recorded his version in 1973. peaked at #97 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n# Marianne Faithfull covered the song on her 1979 album Broken English.\n# Then-New Zealand politician Marilyn Waring covered the song as a single in 1980.\n# Jerry Williams covered the song in 1984 on his album Working Class Hero.\n# Richie Havens covered the song for his 1987 album Richie Havens Sings Beatles and Dylan.\n# Mike Peters covered the song when with The Alarm as a backing track to their 1989 single \"A New South Wales\".\n# David Bowie's band Tin Machine recorded a version of the song on their self-titled debut album.\n# Cyndi Lauper covered the song live on Lennon: A Tribute in 1992.\n# Screaming Trees covered the song for the 1995 tribute album Working Class Hero: A Tribute to John Lennon.\n# Roger Taylor, of Queen, covered the song on his 1998 album Electric Fire.\n# Marilyn Manson covered the song on the B-side of the \"Disposable Teens\" single.\n# Noir D\u00e9sir covered the song on the 2000 album Libert\u00e9 de Circulation'.\n# Hilton Valentine covered the song on his 2004 album It's Folk'n' Skiffle, Mate!\n# Elbow covered the song for Q magazine in 2005.\n# Ozzy Osbourne recorded a version for his 2005 collection Under Cover.\n# Tina Dickow covered the song for Amnesty International's 'Make Some Noise' campaign in Denmark.\n# The Academy Is... covered the song in 2006 on its From the Carpet EP.\n# Green Day contributed a cover of the song to the Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur.

King.\n\nIt's from his album Rock 'N' Roll (1975).\n\nAccording to the documentary History of Rock 'n' Roll, Ben E. King had no intention of recording the song himself when he wrote it.[1]  King had written the song for The Drifters, who passed on the chance to record it. It was not until after the \"Spanish Harlem\" recording session that he had some studio time left over. The session's producers, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, asked if he had any more songs and King played \"Stand by Me\" on the piano for them. They liked it and called all the studio musicians back in to record it. The song was not released on an album until it had been out as a single for two years. After those two years the song appeared as track  seven on King's Don't Play That Song.\n\nKing's version went to number one on the R&B charts[2] and was a Top Ten hit on the U.S. charts twice\u2014in its original release in 1961, when it peaked at #4, and a 1986 rerelease coinciding with its use as the theme song for the movie of the same name following its appearance in the film, when it peaked at #9, and also in an advertisement for Levi Jeans. It also reached #1 on the UK Singles Chart in 1987 after its re-release, mostly due to the jeans spot, originally reaching #27 on its first release.\n\n\"Stand by Me\" was ranked number 121 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 1999, BMI named it as the fourth most-performed song of the 20th century, with about 7 million performances.[3]\n[edit] Structure\n\nThe song uses a version of the common chord progression now called the 50s progression, also known as a \"turn-around\", which have been called the \"'Stand by Me' changes\"[4] after the song.\n[edit] Notable covers, remixes and samples\n\n    * Ben E. King recorded a song that paraphrased it musically, \"Don't Play That Song (You Lied)\".[citation needed]\n    * The Searchers included the song on their 1963 debut album Meet the Searchers.\n    * Otis Redding recorded a version for his album Pain in My Heart.\n    * John Lennon recorded his version of the song for his 1975 album Rock 'n' Roll. Lennon's cover of \"Stand by Me\" was his last hit prior to his five-year retirement from the music industry. This version of the song had a more rock sound than R&B. The acoustic introduction of this version is reminiscent of Ringo Starr's \"Only You (And You Alone)\" from 1974. Lennon suggested Starr cover that song, and Lennon plays guitar on both songs. The B-side of the single was \"Move Over Ms. L\", a rare and raucous track also covered by The Who drummer Keith Moon.\n    * Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller have a version which was featured in the hit musical Smokey Joe's Cafe.\n    * Playing for Change made a music video rendition of \"Stand By Me\" which is a collaboration of over 35 street performers and musicians from all over the world.\n    * Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire recorded his version of the song on his 1985 album Maurice White. White's remake of \"Stand by Me\" peaked at number 6, 11 and 50 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks, Adult Contemporary and Billboard Hot 100 charts respectively.[5]\n    * Mickey Gilley performed a version which was featured in the hit 1980 film Urban Cowboy. It was a #1 country hit for him in August of that year, also reaching #22 on the Pop charts and #3 at Adult Contemporary.\n    * Pennywise recorded a punk cover which was originally released on the EP Wildcard in 1989.\n    * Ronnie Milsap recorded a gospel-altered version on his recent album, Then Sings My Soul.\n    * Gigi D'Agostino released a dance version of this song.\n    * Seal covered the song on his album Soul.\n    * Lemmy Kilmister performed the song with Dave Lombardo and DJ Baron for the soundtrack of the 2009 Flip Skateboards video \"Extremely Sorry.\"\n    * Overboard performed an a cappella version of the song for their 2008 album, Castaways.\n    * Boxer Cassius Clay, later known as Muhammad Ali, released a version of the song in 1963.\n    * J.R. Rotem interpolated Stand By Me when he produced Beautiful Girls by Sean Kingston\n    * U2 has covered it many times while on tour, and once with Bruce Springsteen during the The Joshua Tree Tour. It was also sung during the U2 360\u00b0 Tour at the Rose Bowl at the end of their song I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.\n    * Andy Madadian, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora recorded a version of this song (available only on web) in 2009 as a musical message of \"worldwide solidarity with the people of Iran\".\n    * Timon & Pumbaa also did a version of this song, though during the song sequence when Timon's singing, Pumbaa ends up getting into dangerous situations of sorts.\n    * Stephen King and Warren Zevon recorded a version for the charity compilation album Stranger than Fiction. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon/_/Stand+by+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was recorded at Record Plant Studios in New York City in late October 1971, with the help of producer Phil Spector. It features soaring, heavily echoed vocals, and a sing-along chorus. The children singing in the background were from the Harlem Community Choir and are credited on the song's single.\n\nAlthough the song is a protest song about the Vietnam War, it has become a Christmas standard and has appeared on several Christmas albums.\n\nThe lyric is based on a campaign in late 1969 by John Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, who rented billboards and posters in eleven cities around the world that read: \"WAR IS OVER! (If You Want It) Happy Christmas from John and Yoko\". The cities included New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Rome, Athens, Amsterdam, Berlin, Paris, London, Tokyo and Hong Kong. At the time the US was deeply entrenched in the unpopular Vietnam War. The line \"War is over, if you want it, war is over, now!\", as sung by the background vocals, was taken directly from the billboards.\n\nThe song's melody and chord structure has been compared to that of the folk standard known as \"Stewball\". It is possible that \"Happy Christmas\" was merely a re-write of the traditional standard.\n\nThe record starts with a barely-audible whisper of Christmas greetings to their children: Yoko whispers \"Happy Christmas, Kyoko\", then John whispers \"Happy Christmas, Julian\". The lyric sheet from the 1982 release The John Lennon Collection erroneously gives this introduction as \"Happy Christmas, Yoko. Happy Christmas, John\".\n\nThe single was released in the US on 6 December 1971, but never charted on the Billboard Hot 100 charts; the UK release was delayed until the following November due to a publishing dispute. Upon release, it reached #4 in the UK Singles Chart.

Available on Amazon: http://bit.ly/JLbox & iTunes http://bit.ly/JLboxi Video..."}, "description": "\"(Just Like) Starting Over\" is a song written and performed by John Lennon for his Double Fantasy album.\n\nThis song embodied the sense of renewal in Lennon and Yoko's professional and personal lives during the writing and recording of Double Fantasy. \"It was kinda obvious what Starting Over was about,\" said journalist David Sheff, who did the last major interview with Lennon, to Mojo. \"He'd been untrusting of Yoko, she'd been untrusting of him, all that kind of stuff. But in that one song was this incredible optimism and joy.\" ((Just Like) Starting Over Songfacts) \n\n It was released as a single on 24 October 1980 and reached number one in both the USA and UK two weeks after he was murdered. It is his biggest solo American hit, staying at #1 for five weeks. (When Lennon was shot in New York City on 8 December 1980 the single was at #3 in the US and the following week reached the summit.) In the UK it had peaked at #8 in the charts and had fallen out of the Top 20 before Lennon's death propelled it to #1, making an unprecedented #21 to #1 move. By 6 January 1981 there were 3 Lennon songs in the UK top 5, a feat never achieved before or since.\n\nThis was the first single released from Double Fantasy, and the first new recording Lennon had released since 1975. It was chosen by Lennon not because it was the best track on the album, but because it was the most appropriate following his five year absence from the recording industry. He referred to it during production as the \"Elvis  (Elvis Presley) / Orbison (Roy Orbison)\" track, as he \"tongue in cheek\" impersonated their vocal styles. The uplifting bell at the intro of the song serves as the antidote to the morose bell sound which opens Lennon's first solo album, Lennon seeing it as him having come full circle.\n\nAlthough its origins were in unfinished older compositions like \"Don\u2019t Be Crazy\" and \"My Life\", it was one of the last songs to be completed in time for the Double Fantasy sessions. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hear it until the last day of rehearsal,\u201d producer Jack Douglas said in 2005. Lennon finished the song while on holiday in Bermuda, and recorded it at The Hit Factory in New York City just weeks later. The original title was to be \"Starting Over\". \"(Just Like)\" was added at the last minute because a country song of the same title was recently released by Tammy Wynette.\n\nWhile commercial releases of the song (original 45rpm singles, LP's and Compact Discs) run a length of 3 minutes and 54 seconds, promotional 12\" vinyl singles originally issued to radio stations feature a longer version, officially running at 4 minutes and 17 seconds. This version extends the coda fadeout, and is highly desired by collectors, as it has not appeared on any CD reissue or compilation.\n\nIt is listed at #53 on Billboard's All Time Top Songs.\n\n The Flaming Lips recorded a version for the benefit album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon/_/(Just+Like)+Starting+Over\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was also released as a single, reaching 26 in the UK Single Charts and #18 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, the B-Side was Meat City. Originally titled \"Make Love Not War,\" the song evoked lingering hippie sentiments mixed with the evolving mysticism of the early 1970s.[citation needed] Although Phil Spector was not involved in this album, Lennon's production is similar to the Spector \"Wall of Sound.\"\n\nThis song, which was begun in 1969 and can be heard in the Beatles' Let It Be sessions, was inspired by the book of the same name by Robert Masters and Jean Houston (1972), which emphasized the power of the human brain to induce various states of consciousness without the aid of external substances. The book presented a series of exercises intended to maximize one's potential for problem solving, conflict resolution, visionary thinking, creativity, focused listening and super-communication. Each application would start with a brief meditation cycle followed by the guided instructions of a director. During the exercise, only the director would speak, but each person would share their experience afterwards. Mind alteration had long since been a point of interest to Lennon, however he was aware of the risks involved with chemical consumption. A recommendation by Lennon himself is included with the book. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon/_/Mind+Games\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Available on Amazon: http://bit.ly/JLbox & iTunes http://bit.ly/JLboxi Video..."}, "description": "\"Mother\" is a song by British musician John Lennon, taken from his 1970 album John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. An edited version of the song was released as a single in 1970. This version later appeared on Lennon's 1975 compilation Shaved Fish, as well as on the 1997 compilation Lennon Legend: The Very Best of John Lennon. The single edit of this song is significantly shorter (about 3:38) than the album version. This version cuts out the beginning tolling bells as well as some of Lennon's more guttural screams that intensify at the ending of the song. The B-side features \"Why\" by Yoko Ono.\n\nThough the song is called \"Mother\", it is actually a cry to both of his parents, who \"abandoned\" him in his childhood - father Alf Lennon left the family when John was an infant, and mother Julia was hit by a car and killed on the street by an allegedly drunk-driving off-duty policeman, when her son was 17. Lennon bemoans the loss of his parents singing lyrics such as \"Mother, you had me/but I never had you\"; \"Father, you left me/but I never left you\"; \"I needed you/you didn't need me\"; and \"Mama, don't go/Daddy come home\". It is one of three songs which Lennon wrote for his mother, along with \"Julia\" and \"My Mummy's Dead\". The song begins with the sound of a church bell ringing ominously, signifying death.\n\nAlthough Lennon said that \"Mother\" was the song that \"seemed to catch in my head,\" he had doubts about its commercial appeal and he considered issuing \"Love\" as a single instead. \"Love\" was eventually released as a single in 1982.\n\nLennon was inspired to write the song by a period of using primal therapy, which works on the assumption that the patient has several defences which must be stripped down to reveal the \"real person\". Lennon's wife Yoko Ono worked on this with Dr. Arthur Janov, originally at their home at Tittenhurst Park for a period of three weeks and then at the Primal Institute, California where they remained for four months. Lennon described the therapy as \"something more important to me than The Beatles.\"\n\nBarbra Streisand recorded \"Mother\" (as well as Lennon's \"Love\") on her 1971 album Barbra Joan Streisand and was a single as well. The song was also featured on the live album Live in New York City by Lennon, but released by Yoko Ono after his death. Other songs born out of this period of therapy include \"Working Class Hero\" and \"Isolation\". Shigesato Itoi, creator of the Mother video game series, stated in an interview that this song was in large part the inspiration for his naming of the series. Mia Martini recorded in 1972 this song in Italian, with the title literally translated as \"Madre\". Christina Aguilera covered the song in 2007 for the benefit album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur, and Emmanuel Jal's version was available on that album as an iTunes exclusive bonus track. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon/_/Mother\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

solo album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. The album was released on December 11, 1970 in the U.S. and the UK.\n\nThis song was very controversial upon its release, dealing with religious themes.\n\nMeaning\n\nThe first movement of the song discusses Lennon's disdain for popular religious belief. He believed that God was something different to everyone, and that most people did not focus enough on the moral lessons of religion.[citation needed] He describes God as \"a concept by which we measure our pain\".\n\nIn the second section of the song, Lennon lists many idols that he does not believe in (including The Beatles), ending by stating that he just believes in himself and Yoko. The idols he lists are: magic, I Ching, the Bible, tarot, Hitler, Jesus, Kennedy, Buddha, mantra, Gita, yoga, kings, Elvis, Zimmerman (Bob Dylan) and The Beatles.\n\nThe final section of the song describes Lennon's change since the breakup of The Beatles. He states that he is no longer the \"Dreamweaver\" or \"The Walrus,\" but just \"John.\" The final line of the song, \"The dream is over,\" represents Lennon's stance that the myth \"the Beatles were God\" had come to an end. \"If there is a God,\" Lennon explained, \"we're all it.\"[1]\n\nPersonnel\n\nThe musicians who performed on the original recording were as follows:[2]\n\n    * John Lennon - vocals\n    * Billy Preston - piano\n    * Ringo Starr - drums\n    * Klaus Voormann - bass\n\nAppearances in popular culture\n\n    * The line \"I don't believe in Beatles, I just believe in me\" was referenced in the 1986 film Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\n    * The song has been performed by Queen guitarist Brian May.[3]\n    * Irish rock band U2 wrote a song entitled \"God Part II\", referring to the original Lennon song. The lyrics, written by lead singer Bono, continue the pattern of stating things he doesn't believe in.\n    * \"God\" (and the album Plastic Ono Band generally) was mocked in the National Lampoon Comedy Radio song \"Magical Misery Tour\". This parody reportedly consists entirely of actual quotes from Lennon's famous Rolling Stone magazine interview following the breakup of The Beatles. It ends with \"Lennon\" crying out, \"Mother! They're trying to crucify me!\", followed by a heavily-echoed fadeout of repeated primal screams \"Fuck! Fuck!\".[4]\n    * \"God\" was covered by Jack's Mannequin and Mick Fleetwood, released on Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur (2007).\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon/_/God\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was recorded at Record Plant Studios in New York City in late October 1971, with the help of producer Phil Spector. It features soaring, heavily echoed vocals, and a sing-along chorus. The children singing in the background were from the Harlem Community Choir and are credited on the song's single.\n\nAlthough the song is a protest song about the Vietnam War, it has become a Christmas standard and has appeared on several Christmas albums.\n\nStructure and release:\n\nThe lyric is based on a campaign in late 1969 by John Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, who rented billboards and posters in eleven cities around the world that read: \"WAR IS OVER! (If You Want It) Happy Christmas from John and Yoko\". The cities included New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Rome, Athens, Amsterdam, Berlin, Paris, London, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Helsinki. At the time the US was deeply entrenched in the unpopular Vietnam War. The line \"War is over, if you want it, war is over, now!\", as sung by the background vocals, was taken directly from the billboards.\n\nThe song's melody and chord structure has been compared to that of the folk standard known as \"Stewball\".\n\nThe record starts with a barely-audible whisper of Christmas greetings to their children: Yoko whispers \"Happy Christmas, Kyoko\", then John whispers \"Happy Christmas, Julian\". The lyric sheet from the 1982 release The John Lennon Collection erroneously gives this introduction as \"Happy Christmas, Yoko. Happy Christmas, John\".\n\nThe single was released in the US on 6 December 1971, but never charted on the Billboard Hot 100 charts; the UK release was delayed until the following November due to a publishing dispute. Upon release, it reached #4 in the UK Singles Chart. The song was re-released in the UK on 20 December 1980 shortly after John Lennon's death on 8 December 1980, peaking at Number 3.\n\nMusicians on the original recording were:\nVocals: John Lennon, Yoko Ono and the Harlem Community Choir\nGuitar and bass guitar: Hugh McCracken, Chris Osborn, Teddy Irwin, Stuart Scharf\nKeyboards, chimes and glockenspiel: Nicky Hopkins\nDrums and sleigh bells: Jim Keltner\n\nKlaus Voormann was supposed to play bass guitar on the song but was unable to attend the session when his plane was delayed. One of the four guitarists played the bass part but it is unknown which one. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon/_/Happy+Christmas+(War+Is+Over)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released on the 1980 album Double Fantasy, the last album by Lennon and Ono released before his death.\n\nThe song was written for Lennon's son Sean, his only child with Yoko Ono. It begins with John comforting his son from what is presumably a nightmare and develops into John passionately describing the love he has for his son and the joy Sean gave him. At the end of the song, John whispers \"Good night Sean, see you in the morning.\"\n\nThe lines \"Every day in every way/It's getting better and better\" are repeated in the song. They are inspired by the mantra of French psychologist \u00c9mile Cou\u00e9, who had his patients repeat the lines \"Day by day, in every way, I am getting better and better\" (Tous les jours \u00e0 tous points de vue je vais de mieux en mieux) over and over again as part of therapy.\n\nIt's also been suggested that the lyrics \"Every day in every way/It's getting better and better\" are something of a tribute to Paul McCartney, as Paul had written the famous song \"Getting Better\" on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which included the lyrics \"It's getting better and better.\"\n\nAt the end of the song, John Lennon whispers \"Good night, Sean. See you in the morning. Right again\" in a similar fashion to what Ringo Starr whispers at the end of the Beatles song Good Night, which was a song written by John Lennon for his other son, Julian Lennon.\n\nThis song is not to be confused with \"Beautiful Boys,\" a song by Yoko Ono that also appears on Double Fantasy.\n\nIt is included in the movie Mr. Holland's Opus featuring Richard Dreyfuss. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon/_/Beautiful+Boy+(Darling+Boy)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

(original album) / John Lennon."}, "description": "\"How Do You Sleep?\" is a song from John Lennon's 1971 album Imagine, in which he attacks his former The Beatles songwriting partner and close friend Paul McCartney. The song features a slide guitar part played by George Harrison.\n\nAccording to the How Do You Sleep Songfacts, the feud between Lennon and McCartney originated after The Beatles manager Brian Epstein passed away. Paul wanted his new father-in-law to manage the group while the other Beatles wanted the notorious Allen Klein. Lennon and McCartney maintained a frosty relationship after the band broke up. \n\nThe song's lyrics refer to the Paul is dead hoax (\"Those freaks was right when they said you was dead\").\n\nThe song begins with the words, \"So Sergeant Pepper took you by surprise\", referring to the landmark album that the Beatles made. Preceding this first line are ambient sounds evocative of those heard at the beginning of the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album.\n\nThe lyrics \"The only thing you done was yesterday/And since you've gone you're just another day\" are direct shots at Paul McCartney as well, the first lyric being a reference to the Beatles' 1965 song \"Yesterday\", McCartney's most popular song and technically the first Beatles' \"solo\" track because no other Beatle was involved in the recording. The second lyric could be considered a reference to McCartney's hit single \"Another Day\", released earlier in 1971.\n\nAlthough Lennon receives the sole credit as the song's author, multiple reports indicate that Ono as well as Allen Klein, John's manager, also contributed lyrics.\n\nIn addition to George Harrison on slide guitar, the song featured Lennon on piano and vocals, Klaus Voormann on bass, Alan White on drums, acoustic guitar played by Ted Turner, Rod Linton, and Andy Davis, as well as additional piano parts by Nicky Hopkins and John Tout (Hopkins likely contributing electric piano, as he had done previously on the Beatles \"Revolution\").\n\nLennon felt attacked by McCartney, who later admitted that lines in the song \"Too Many People\" on the album Ram were intended as digs at Lennon (Lennon thought that other songs on the album, such as \"3 Legs,\" contained similar attacks). Ringo Starr visited the studio during the recording of the song and was reportedly upset, saying: \"That's enough, John.\" Lennon and McCartney later reconciled.\n\nA demo version of the song appears on John Lennon Anthology, released in 1998.\n\nIn the DVD special documentary on RAM Paul McCartney said that on hearing \"How Do You Sleep?\", a song from John Lennon's album Imagine, considered writing a song \"Very Well, Thank You.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon/_/How+Do+You+Sleep%3F\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

But it was the albums rhythmically aggressive and seductive title track where fans got their first glimpse of the authentic John Waite, a no-holds-barred rock n roll performer devoted heart and soul to live performance and making sure every fan in the audience left the concert hall just as elated and exhausted as the band theyd paid to see.After John Lennons assassination, December 9, 1980, a bizarre thing happened during one of those furious Babys performances when John was pulled from the stage by an overzealous fan during an encore. The freak event seriously injured his knee and the group disbanded shortly thereafter. From the ashes of the Babys, however, rose an abundant and prodigious solo career, ignited by the well-received release, Ignition, that featured the single, Change, which rode the AOR charts for weeks in 1982, the year a new cable channel that would alter the course of popular media culture called MTV launched. At the forefront of its early play list was the video for the Holly Knight-penned track that in 1985, was included on the platinum-selling Vision Quest soundtrack.Johns next solo effort, 1984s No Brakes, did exactly what the title inferred, barreling at runaway train speed to international acclaim and U.S. platinum success thanks to the smash hit, Missing You, which did not stop until it reached Number 1 on the Billboards Hot 100 Singles, Album Rock Tracks and Adult Contemporary charts. The following up single, Tears was a top 10 hit on the Billboard Mainstream Rock charts.Continuing to evolve as both a songwriter and formidable stage presence, Mask of Smiles was released in 1985, possessing a pair of muscular hit melodies, Every Step of the Way, and If Anybody Had a Heart, which appeared on the soundtrack to the 1986 motion picture, About Last Night starring Demi Moore. Johns fourth solo LP, Rovers Return, highlighted by the superlative, These Times Are Hard for Lovers. The same season that Bon Jovi was urging two lovers to live on a prayer, John delivered an aortal anthem of timeless resonance. Baby we can make it cause our love will pull us through/ these times are hard for lovers its down to me and you/Nothings gonna break us if we hang on to whats true, these times are hard for lovers, I believe I you.I dont have a plan and most of the songwriting is a knee jerk reaction of being alive. I try to speak from an honest place where the listener can both hear and feel where Im coming from; the job is mine, to help them understand me. Theres a real need as an artist to express who you are and where youre coming from.A long and prodigious career often combines composition and interpretation, like in 1990 when John recorded the Martin Page and Bernie Taupin-penned track, Deal for Life for the Days of Thunder soundtrack. But two years prior to that cinematic adventure, superbly performing another songwriters work led to one of the biggest hits on John Waites illustrious resume. In 1988, a reunion with former Babys band mates, Jonathan Cain and Ricky Phillips along with uber-guitarist Neal Schon from Journey and drummer Deen Castronovo resulted in the John Waite fronted supergroup, Bad English. And in 1989, the groups ballad, When I See You Smile, penned by Grammy-winning songwriter, Diane Warren went to Number 1 on Billboards Hot 100 and was certified Gold. The album reached Top Five and sold more than two million units in the U.S. alone. Bad English released two albums before breaking up in 1992.Since returning to the recording studio and concert trek as a solo artist in 1995, John has produced a string of solid, existentially eccentric, courageously eclectic and blisteringly electric rock n roll records, including 1995s Temple Bar, 1997s When You Were Mine, 2001s Figure in a Landscape, 2004s The Hard Way, 2006s Downtown: Journey of a Heart and 2010s In Real Time an extraordinary live recording that featured burning in-concert realizations of the Babys Change, Back on My Feet Again and Head First, not to mention Bad Englishs Best of What Ive Got as well as a mind-blowing cover of Led Zeppelins Rock and Roll. It was this lifelong passion for original Country that inspired Johns sensational 2006 duet with bluegrass legend, Allison Krauss, where the two combined honeysweet vocal forces to remake his international hit, Missing You. On February 5, 2007, they performed the song on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.John teamed up with Matchbox 20 lead guitarist and songwriter, Kyle Cook in 2011 and their creative chemistry birthed the exhilarating Rough & Tumble, a long form exercise in raucous riffs and bloody truths highlighted by Further the Sky, Shadows of Love and the Classic Radio chart topping title track, a remarkable feat for any musician to reach number one airplay after three and a half decades in the music business trenches.All-Access Live hit the streets in 2012 and delivered on all stages of Johns careersolo, The Babys and Bad English. Bearing a dynamic, stripped down sound which shows off his talented three-piece band, Waite demonstrates why hes considered one of the great rock and roll singers, imbuing the timeless material with saber toothed vitality and kinetic power.In 2014, Waite is back with Best. Navigating raucous rock, gut bucket blues and country, Waites new greatest hits album is a thrilling snapshot representing the inspired artistic breadth of this legendary artists entire career tallying more than 40 years on the rock and roll highway. From re-recorded versions of signature classics, Back on My Feet Again, Isnt It Time and Missing You, hard-hitting live renditions of Head First, Saturday Night and Change to the more introspective fare of Suicide Life, Downtown and Bluebird Cafe, Best goes a long way in proving theres many miles left of unexplored road for this rock and roll wunderkind.The story is far from over for the Lancaster, England-born rock star/balladeer/storyteller who was inspired onto his musical path by childhood blues-based heroes like Free, the Small Faces and Humble Pie, along with a deep connection to the Celtic folk music of his homeland. The legacy of John Waite is a beautiful monster of sound and vision, the chronicle of an authentic artist, a superstar, a seeker of truth and a soother of hearts. He walks and rocks among us.", "title": "John Waite", "url": "http://austin.eventful.com/events/john-waite-/E0-001-108041454-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Austin City Limits Live @ Moody Theater", "date": "2018-02-22 19:30:00"}, {"city": "Liverpool", "description": " The race for the holy grail of pop memorabilia is on, in the world-premiere of a brand-new comedy.

Nineteen-time Grammy nominee, four-time Grammy winner and all-time guitar great Larry Carlton has set a standard for artistry that spans four decades. John Pizzarelli has been hailed by The Boston Globe for &quot;reinvigorating the Great American Songbook and re-popularizing jazz,&quot; while also performing the music of Joni Mitchell, Tom Waits and Lennon-McCartney.<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.mayoarts.org/event/john-pizzarelli-and-larry-carlton#artistbackground\" rel=\"nofollow\">Background</a></li></ul><ul><li><p><u><strong>Larry Carlton</strong></u><br><p>Larry Carlton\u2019s own musical story began in Southern California. He picked up his first guitar when he was only six years old. He was introduced to jazz in junior high school after hearing The Gerald Wilson Big Band album, Moment of Truth, with guitarist Joe Pass. Larry then became interested in Barney Kessel, Wes Montgornery and the legendary blues guitarist B.B. King. Saxophonist John Coltrane was also a major influence on Carlton, beginning with Coltrane\u2019s 1962 classic Ballads.<p>In 1968 he recorded his first LP, With A Little Help From My Friends (Uni). The enthusiastic industry response garnered him a place among jingle singers The Going Thing, recording on camera and radio commercials for Ford. Mid-season in his second year, he segued to Musical Director for Mrs. Alphabet, an Emmy-nominated children\u2019s show on the same network. It was here that Carlton showcased his acting skills, performing as the show\u2019s co-star, &quot;Larry Guitar.&quot;<p>Calls began to increase significantly as Carlton gained distinction for the unmistakable and often imitated &quot;sweet&quot; sound he delivered with his Gibson ES-335. He also broke new ground with his new trademark volume pedal technique, eloquently displayed in his featured performance on \u00adCrusader One with legendary jazz/rock group The Crusaders in 1971. Joni Mitchell\u2019s Court and Spark album, the first record she made with a rhythm section, displays his distinctive Technique \u2013 a style Mitchell referred to as &quot;fly fishing.&quot;<p>During his tenure with The Crusaders (through 1976), Carlton performed on 13 of their albums, often contributing material. In 1973, Carlton released his second solo project, SinginglPlaying, on Blue Thumb Records \u00ad aptly titled, as he not only played guitar, but also performed vocals on eight tracks. Carlton\u2019s demand as a session player was now at its zenith, he was constantly featured with stars from every imaginable genre, ranging from Sammy Davis, Jr., and Herb Alpert to Quincy Jones, Paul Anka, Michael Jackson, John Lennon, Jerry Garcia and Dolly Parton. At the same time, he was still performing more than 50 dates a year with The Crusaders.<p>Before he transitioned completely to a solo career, Carlton became one of the most in-demand studio musicians of the past three decades. Carlton\u2019s catalog of work includes film soundtracks, television themes and work on more than 100 gold albums.<p>Ultimately, Carlton began scaling back his session work substantially, while continuing to perform and record with the Crusaders. He shifted his emphasis to the challenges of arranging and producing, and built his own studio-Room 335-in his home. During this period he arranged and produced projects for Barbra Streisand, Joan Baez and Larry Gatlin, as well as producing and co-writing the theme for the hit sitcom Who\u2019s The Boss and co-writing (with Michel Columbier) and arranging the acclaimed movie soundtrack for Against All Odds.<p>As his association with the Crusaders began to draw to a close, Carlton signed with Warner Bros. Records in 1977. Between \u201978 and \u201984, Larry recorded six solo albums for Warner Bros. Records: Mr. 335: Live In Japan, Friends; Eight Times Up; Sleep Walk; Strikes Twice; Larry Carlton. The latter self-titled album was released hot on the heels of his debut session with rock supergroup Steely Dan. Rolling Stone magazine lists Carlton\u2019s tasty ascent on Steely Dan\u2019s Kid Charlemagne as one of the three best guitar licks in rock music.<p>With more than 3000 studio sessions under his belt by the early 1980s, Carlton had picked up four Grammy nominations. In addition to winning a Grammy (`81) for the theme to &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; (a collaboration with Mike Post), he also was voted NARAS\u2019s &quot;Most Valuable Player&quot; for three consecutive years. NARAS then named him &quot;Player Emeritus&quot; and retired him from eligibility.<p>In 1985 he was approached by the newly formed MCA Master Series to consider doing an acoustic jazz album. His first release for the new label was Alone, But Never Alone, a consensus No. 1 album on the Radio & Records and Billboard Jazz charts. The twelve months of 1987 brought some of the biggest highlights in Carlton\u2019s solo career. In addition to winning the Grammy for &quot;Minute by Minute,&quot; Carlton received a Grammy nomination for &quot;Best Jazz Fusion Performance&quot; for his live album Last Nite. Coming off of the success of two acoustic albums and one live album, Carlton was on a hot streak and entered the studio to work on his next project, On Solid Ground. The all-electric project was nominated for a Grammy in 1989. The release of On Solid Ground came almost one year after Carlton was brutally shot in a random act of violence outside his Los Angeles studio.<p>In 1990, MCA acquired GRP Records and placed their jazz artists under the GRP moniker. Immediately, GRP issued a greatest hits package of Carlton\u2019s work on MCA, called Collection. In 1991, Carlton entered the studio to record a blues-based album with John Ferraro, keyboard man Matt Rollings, bassist Michael Rhodes and harmonica player Terry McMillan. Interrupted by label and consumer demands for another jazz offering, Carlton temporarily shelved what would become Renegade Gentlemen and recorded and released Kid Gloves in \u201992. A pop-oriented Jazz collection of lilting acoustic ballads and biting electric workouts, the album marked the first time Carlton had included both acoustic and electric tracks on a single solo project.<p>In between touring, Carlton resumed work on the bluesy Renegade Gentlemen. Taking the original six tracks to Nashville (his first time to record in that city), and joining up once again with Michael Rhodes and Terry McMillan, plus drummer Chris Layton (from Stevie Vaughan\u2019s band Double Trouble) and keyboard wizard Chuck Leavell, he recorded four tracks, plus did additional production and mixing on the blues rocker in time for a \u201993 release.<p>Carlton toured extensively that year and the next with jazz superband Stanley Clark And Friends (Stanley Clark, Larry Carlton, Billy Cobham, Deron Johnson and Najee). The quintet released Stanley Clark and Friends Live A t The Greek in \u201994.<p>Larry & Lee, Carlton\u2019s 1995 collaboration with guitar great Lee Ritenour, garnered him his eighth Grammy nomination. This was followed by The Gift in \u201996 and Larry Carlton Collection Volume 2 in \u201997. That same year, his virtuosity and reputation secured him a place in the crum\u00adtopping award-winning Warner Bros. Records\u2019 group Fourplay, when member Lee Ritenour left to head his own label. Carlton doubled the fun by signing to Wamer Jazz as a solo artist at the same time. Since then he has released two albums with Fourplay: 4 in \u201998 and a refreshingly different Christmas album, Snowbound, in October \u201999. 1999 also brought Larry Carlton his very own spot on Hollywood\u2019s prestigious Rockwalk. On June 3, he was inducted along with Joe Satriani, Steve Vai and Jimmie Vaughn.<p>The year 2000 starts with Carlton putting his singularly superb fingerprints on the new millennium with his star-studded solo release on Wamer Bros. Records, Fingerprints. Utterly unique, Larry Carlton has set a standard for artistry that spans three decades (and two centuries) and he is undoubtedly destined to leave his mark on jazz, blues, pop and rock for the foreseeable future\u2026<p><u><strong>John Pizzarelli</strong></u><br>\u00a0<p>World-renowned guitarist and singer John Pizzarelli has been hailed by the Boston Globe for \u201creinvigorating the Great American Songbook and re-popularizing jazz.\u201d The\u00a0Toronto Star\u00a0pegged him as \u201cthe genial genius of the guitar.\u201d And the\u00a0Seattle Times\u00a0saluted him as \u201ca rare entertainer of the old school.\u201d<p>Established as one of the prime contemporary interpreters of the Great American Songbook, Pizzarelli has expanded that repertoire by including the music of Paul McCartney, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Tom Waits, Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim and the Beatles. His themed shows, often performed with his wife Jessica Molaskey, suggest there is no limit to Pizzarelli\u2019s imagination or talent.<p>The New York Times called their recent \u201cMy Generation\u201d show \u201cbrilliant,\u201d raving the couple \u201cembrace the present, or what used to be the present, and reflect on the passage of years. Like all of their shows, \u2018My Generation\u2019 is deeply felt. You have a strong sense that they are baring their personal struggles and resetting their compasses as they go forward.\u201d<p>An earlier rave from the Times noted, \u201cThe ability to infuse pop and jazz with a Chekhovian wisdom about life\u2019s ups and downs is the special gift of John Pizzarelli and Jessica Molaskey, long-married musical partners whose work gets deeper each year.\u201d<p>Having concentrated on the music of Paul McCartney, Johnny Mercer and Frank Sinatra over the last two years, Pizzarelli has returned to the bossa nova of Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim with his July 28, 2017 Concord Jazz release Sinatra & Jobim @ 50.\u00a0 With co-vocalist Daniel Jobim, grandson of the legendary Brazilian composer, the two explore songs Sinatra and Jobim recorded in 1967 and 1969 as well as add new songs to the mix flavored with the spirit of the classic Francis Albert Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim album.<p>For an artist The New York Times calls \u201cone of the foremost interpreters of Jobim\u2019s bossa nova classics,\u201d the step was natural.<p>\u201cWe had a very successful run in Brazil [in 2016] and my manager said you should think about making another Brazilian record,\u201d Pizzarelli says referring to his 2004 release Bossa Nova. \u201cI looked around at what would make sense in terms of an anniversary.\u201d<p>Homing in on the Sinatra-Jobim sessions, John says, \u201cWe had an advantage: Daniel had performed a number of those things with us at the Caf\u00e9 Carlyle two years earlier.\u201d Like Sinatra and Jobim, who started their sessions in January 1967, Pizzarelli and company were finished in three days of recording\u2014in January 2017.<p>Pizzarelli\u2019s latest album for Concord is a follow-up to his wildly successful Midnight McCartney, an album The New Yorker said \u201cmay be the best collection of McCartney covers ever recorded.\u201d<p>Since its release in 2015, Pizzarelli has toured North America, South America, Asia and Europe performing shows centered on Frank Sinatra\u2019s centennial, the songs of Johnny Mercer and a McCartney program in which his quartet is joined by strings and a horn section. He also tours on a double bill with pianist Ramsey Lewis and is looking forward to touring a celebration of Nat King Cole\u2019s music for his centennial, which will be in 2019.<p>\u201cHis sound was singular and inspired,\u201d says Pizzarelli, who started playing guitar at age six, following in the tradition of his father Bucky. \u201cI\u2019ve always said we\u2019re an extension, a 21st-century version of what that group was.\u201d<p>While plenty of jazz greats influenced his work\u2014Benny Goodman, Les Paul, Zoot Sims, Clark Terry and Slam Stewart, among others\u2014Cole has been Pizzarelli\u2019s hero and foundation over the last 25 years. He devoted two albums to his music,\u00a0Dear Mr. Cole\u00a0in 1994 and\u00a0P.S. Mr. Cole, recorded and released five years later.<p>Pizzarelli\u2019s solo recording career started in 1990 with\u00a0My Blue Heaven\u00a0on Chesky Records. He played clubs and concert halls on the jazz circuit, opening for such greats as Dave Brubeck, Ramsey Lewis and Rosemary Clooney. In 1993, he was honored to open for Frank Sinatra\u2019s international tour and then joined in the celebration for his 80th birthday at Carnegie Hall, bringing down the house singing \u201cI Don\u2019t Know Why I Love You Like I Do\u201d with his father accompanying him.<p>After recording albums for RCA devoted to torch ballads\u00a0(After Hours), classic swing and bold originals\u00a0(Our Love Is Here to Stay),\u00a0 holiday songs\u00a0(Let\u2019s Share Christmas)\u00a0and the Fab Four\u00a0(John Pizzarelli Meets the Beatles), Pizzarelli signed with Telarc International, a division of Concord Music Group. His string of successful albums started in 2000 with\u00a0Kisses in the Rain, a diverse set of standards and original tunes that showcase the spontaneity of his live performances within a studio setting,\u00a0followed by\u00a0Let There Be Love.<p>On his 2002 album,\u00a0The Rare Delight of You, Pizzarelli teamed up with veteran pianist George Shearing. In the tradition of classic quintet-and-vocalist recordings, they lay down great standards (including \u201cBe Careful, It\u2019s My Heart,\u201d \u201cIf Dreams Come True\u201d and \u201cLost April\u201d) as well as a couple originals, all with vibrant arrangements. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the John Pizzarelli Trio along with pianist Ray Kennedy and bassist/brother Martin Pizzarelli,\u00a0Live at Birdland\u00a0was released in April 2003. This two-disc set seamlessly blends James Taylor folk with Gershwin and Van Heusen standards, in addition to original Pizzarelli compositions. After listening to the recording, a JazzTimes critic raved, \u201cSpend five minutes with Pizzarelli and you\u2019ll fully appreciate his inimitable warmth, humor and munificence of spirit.\u201d<p>In 2004, Pizzarelli made his first album of Brazilian music, Bossa Nova. Produced by Russ Titelman, the acclaimed disc features several Brazilian musicians including drummer Paulo Braga, pianist C\u00e9sar Camargo Mariano and vocalist Daniel Jobim. According to\u00a0Billboard, \u201cHis performance throughout, as both vocalist and guitarist, is exceptional.\u201d<p>Knowing You, Pizzarelli\u2019s 2005 release, pays homage to the many talented musicians and songwriters he\u2019s met throughout his career, among them Jimmy McHugh, Sammy Cahn, Alan and Marilyn Bergman, Johnny Mandel and Brian Wilson. The\u00a0Associated Press\u00a0called the disc \u201cA classy, urbane session. The rich colors make this among the best of Pizzarelli\u2019s albums.\u201d<p>In 2006, Telarc introduced\u00a0Dear Mr. Sinatra, John\u2019s tribute set to \u201cOl\u2019 Blue Eyes,\u201d featuring the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra. The collection features John Clayton\u2019s clever reworking of\u00a0 standards such as\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve Got You Under My Skin\u201d and \u201cYou Make Me Feel So Young,\u201d as well as songs written for Sinatra, \u201cRing-A-Ding-Ding!,\u201d \u201cNice and Easy\u201d and \u201cThe Last Dance.\u201d\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0praised the recording for \u201cexploding with enthusiasm and excitement.\u201d<p>His 2008 recording, the GRAMMY Award-nominated\u00a0With a Song in My Heart, celebrates the music of composer Richard Rodgers and includes swinging Rodgers & Hart standards like \u201cThe Lady Is a Tramp,\u201d \u201cMountain Greenery\u201d and \u201cJohnny One Note\u201d and theater songs from\u00a0South Pacific\u00a0and\u00a0The King and I.<p>The singer-guitarist\u2019s first-ever Duke Ellington recording,\u00a0Rockin\u2019 in Rhythm, was released in February 2010. For the dozen tracks, Pizzarelli took the tack of Ellington, noticeably displaying the strengths of the musicians in the band. In addition to a cut for solo guitar, four songs highlight the quartet (with pianist Larry Fuller, bassist Martin Pizzarelli and drummer Tony Tedesco) and seven include the Swing Seven horns with arrangements by Don Sebesky.<p>Pizzarelli married songs from great pop songwriters of his own generation with traditional jazz arrangements and melodies.\u00a0\u00a0Double Exposure, released in 2012, united the Beatles and Lee Morgan, Tom Waits with Billy Strayhorn and the Allman Brothers Band with the style of Wes Montgomery.<p>As he told the\u00a0Wall Street Journal, \u201cI asked myself a couple of questions: \u2018How can we take the style we do and communicate it to people who grew up on Gershwin and people who grew up on the Beatles? How do we communicate jazz to the non-jazz listeners?\u2019\u201d<p>The Guardian\u00a0in the U.K. was among the many publications to praise the album: \u201cThe arrangements are sharp and witty, the singing deceptively easygoing, and the guitar playing just terrific. It\u2019s a delight.\u201d<p>Pizzarelli\u2019s Midnight McCartney had its origins in McCartney\u2019s GRAMMY-winning 2012 album,\u00a0Kisses on the Bottom. Pizzarelli played guitar on 10 of the album\u2019s 14 tracks and backed Sir Paul at an iTunes concert at Capitol Records Studios, the GRAMMY Awards and the Recording Academy\u2019s annual MusiCares Person of the Year Gala.<p>Fifteen months after those gigs, McCartney wrote to Pizzarelli to consider recording some of his lesser-known songs in a jazz style. The album hit a new chart high for John, reaching No. 4 on Billboard\u2019s Jazz Albums chart.<p>In addition to being a bandleader and solo performer, John has been a special guest on recordings for major pop names such as James Taylor, Natalie Cole, Kristin Chenoweth, Tom Wopat, Rickie Lee Jones and Dave Van Ronk, as well as leading jazz artists such as Rosemary Clooney, Ruby Braff, Johnny Frigo, Buddy DeFranco, Harry Allen and, of course, Bucky Pizzarelli.

A bona fide guitar hero, perennial<br>poll-winner (winning more awards than any guitarist living or dead), and prolific composer, he<br>has amassed over 30 albums as a leader while collaborating on more than a dozen or so others<br>with the likes of the fusion supergroup Return to Forever (with Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke and<br>Lenny White), the celebrated acoustic Guitar Trio featuring fellow virtuosos John McLaughlin<br>and Paco de Lucia, and the Rite of Strings trio with bassist Clarke and violinist Jean-Luc Ponty.<br>And while his dazzling technique on both acoustic and electric guitars has afforded him regal<br>status among the hordes of fretboard fanatics who regularly flock to his concerts, the depth of Di<br>Meola&#39;s writing along with the soulfulness and the inherent lyricism of his guitaristic expression<br>have won him legions of fans worldwide beyond the guitar aficionado set.<p>A pioneer of blending world music and jazz, going back to early Latin-tinged fusion outings like<br>1976&#39;s Land of the Midnight Sun, 1977&#39;s Elegant Gypsy and 1978&#39;s Casino, the guitar great<br>continues to explore the rich influence of flamenco, tango, Middle Eastern, Brazilian and African<br>music with his World Sinfonia, an ambitious pan-global group that he formed in 1991. Their<br>exhilarating world music fusion has been documented on such releases as 2000\u2019s The Grande<br>Passion (featuring the Toronto Symphony Orchestra), 2007\u2019s Live in London, 2011\u2019s Pursuit of<br>Radical Rhapsody and the stunning 2012 DVD, Morocco Fantasia (recorded at the Mawazine<br>Festival in Rabat, Morocco and featuring special guests Said Chraibi on oud, Abdellah Meri on<br>violin and Tari Ben Ali on percussion).<p>Growing up in Bergenfield, NJ with the music of Elvis Presley, The Ventures and The Beatles, Di<br>Meola naturally gravitated to guitar as a youngster and by his early teens was already an<br>accomplished player. Attaining such impressive skills at such a young age didn&#39;t come easy for<br>Al, but rather was the result of focused dedication and intensive periods of woodshedding<br>between his junior and senior years in high school. \u201cI used to practice the guitar eight to ten<br>hours a day,\u201d he told Down Beat. \u201cAnd I was trying to find myself, or find the kind of music that<br>suited where I was going with the guitar.\u201d<p>His earliest role models in jazz included guitarists Tal Farlow and Kenny Burrell. But when he<br>discovered Larry Coryell, whom Al would later dub \u201cThe Godfather of Fusion,\u201d he was taken with<br>the guitarist&#39;s unprecedented blending of jazz, blues and rock into one seamless vocabulary on<br>the instrument. \u201cI used to ride the bus from New Jersey to see him at little clubs in Greenwich<br>Village,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWherever he was playing, I&#39;d be there.\u201d In 1972, Al enrolled at the Berklee<br>College of Music in Boston and by the second semester there began playing in a fusion quartet<br>led by keyboardist Barry Miles. When a gig tape of that band was later passed on to Chick<br>Corea by a friend of Al&#39;s in 1974, the 19-year-old guitarist was tapped to join Corea\u2019s fusion<br>supergroup Return to Forever as a replacement for guitarist Bill Connors.<p>After three landmark recordings with Return to Forever -- 1974&#39;s Where Have I Known You<br>Before, 1975&#39;s Grammy Award winning No Mystery and 1976&#39;s Romantic Warrior -- the group<br>disbanded and Al subsequently started up his career as a solo artist. His 1976 debut as a<p>leader, Land of the Midnight Sun, was a blazing showcase of his signature chops and Latin-<br>tinged compositions that featured a stellar cast including drummers Steve Gadd and Lenny<p>White, bassist Anthony Jackson and Jaco Pastorius, keyboardists Jan Hammer, Barry Miles and<br>Chick Corea and percussionist Mingo Lewis. Over the course of six more albums with Columbia<p>Records \u2013 Elegant Gypsy, Casino, Splendido Hotel, Electric Rendezvous, Tour De Force and<br>Scenario \u2013 Al established himself as an influential force in contemporary music.<br>1980 marked the triumph of the acoustic guitar trio with Paco De Lucia and John McLaughlin.<br>Their debut recording on Columbia Records, Friday Night in San Francisco, became a landmark<br>recording that surpassed the four million mark in sales. The following year, 1981, Di Meola was<br>inducted into Guitar Player\u2019s Gallery of Greats after five consecutive wins as Best Jazz Guitarist<br>in the magazine\u2019s Readers Poll and winning best album and acoustic guitarist for a total of a<br>record eleven wins. The three virtuosos in the trio toured together from 1980 through 1983,<br>releasing the studio album Passion, Grace & Fire in 1982. In 1995, they reunited for a third<br>recording, Guitar Trio, follow by another triumphant world tour.<p>In early 1996, Di Meola formed a new trio with the violinist Jean-Luc Ponty and RTF bandmate<br>Stanley Clarke called The Rite of Strings. Their self-titled debut was released in 1995. Di Meola<br>subsequently recorded with the likes of opera superstar Luciano Pavarotti, pop stars Paul<br>Simon, classical guitarist Manuel Barrueco, and Italian pop star Pino Daniele. Over the course<br>of his career, he has also worked and recorded with Phil Collins, Carlos Santana, Steve<br>Winwood, Wayne Shorter, Tony Williams, Herbie Hancock, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Milton<br>Naciemento, Egberto Gismonti, Stevie Wonder, Les Paul, Jimmy Page, Steve Vai, Frank Zappa<br>and Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba.<p>Di Meola\u2019s 2013 release All Your Life was an acoustic tour de force that had him revisiting the<br>music of a seminal influence \u2013 The Beatles. \u201cI really credit the Beatles for the reason why I play<br>guitar,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was a major catalyst for me to want to learn music, so their impact was<br>pretty strong.\u201d A virtual one-man show of virtuosity, it features the guitar great interpreting 14<br>familiar Beatles tunes in the stripped-down setting of strictly acoustic guitar.<br>While currently juggling acoustic tours in Europe and electric tours in the United States, Di<br>Meola arrives at the perfect marriage of the two aesthetics on his latest album, 2015\u2019s Elysium,<br>which finds the guitar great blending the lush tones of his nylon string Conde Hermanos<br>acoustic prototype model and a \u201971 Les Paul electric (his Return to Forever and Elegant Gypsy<br>axe) in a collection of songs that are at once invigorating and alluring. \u201cIt represents a new<br>composition phase for me, whereby the writing became, in a sense, my therapy during a<br>challenging personal transition in my life,&quot; he said.<p>Di Meola is currently on tour in Europe and North America. In 2015, he was honored as the<br>22nd recipient of the Montreal Jazz Festival\u2019s Miles Davis Award, created in 1994 to honor a<br>great international jazz musician for the entire body of his or her work and for that musician\u2019s<br>influence in regenerating the jazz idiom.<p>During a 40-plus year career marked by hugely influential recordings and worldwide tours, Di<br>Meola has regenerated the jazz idiom three times over while dedicating himself to his art. And at<br>age 63, this guitar hero seems inspired to begin a new chapter in his career with the release of<br>OPUS (EAR Music) in February 2017.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>", "title": "Al Di Meola Duo: An Intimate Acoustic Evening feat. song from \u201cOpus\u201d, Piazzolla, Lennon & McCartney & Di Meola\u201d (Album Release)", "url": "http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/al-di-meola-duo-intimate-acoustic-evening-feat-s-/E0-001-109844698-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "City Winery - New York", "date": "2018-02-12 00:00:00"}], "description": "John Winston Ono Lennon, MBE (born John Winston Lennon; 9 October 1940 \u2013 8 December 1980) was an English singer, songwriter, musician, and activist who co-founded The Beatles, the most commercially successful and musically influential band in the history of popular music. He and fellow member Paul McCartney formed a much-celebrated songwriting partnership.\n\nBorn and raised in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. He formed his first band, the Quarrymen, in 1957 which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. When the group disbanded in 1970, Lennon embarked on a sporadic solo career that produced albums including John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine, and songs such as \"Give Peace a Chance\", \"Working Class Hero\", and \"Imagine\". After he married Yoko Ono in 1969, he added \"Ono\" as one of his middle names. Lennon disengaged himself from the music business in 1975 to raise his infant son Sean, but re-emerged with Ono in 1980 with the new album Double Fantasy. He was shot and killed in front of his Manhattan apartment three weeks after its release.\n\nLennon revealed a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. Controversial through his political and peace activism, he moved from London to Manhattan in 1971, where his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a lengthy attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. Some of his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture.\n\nBy 2012 (thirty-two years after his death), Lennon's solo album sales in the United States had exceeded 14 million units. He is responsible for 25 number-one singles on the US Hot 100 chart as a writer, co-writer, or performer. In 2002, Lennon was voted eighth in a BBC poll of the 100 Greatest Britons and in 2008, Rolling Stone ranked him the fifth-greatest singer of all time. In 1987, he was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Lennon was twice inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\u2014first in 1988 as a member of the Beatles and again in 1994 as a solo artist. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

is happening by accident\nListen, I don't slack a bit\nGame plan solid, no cracks in it\nSaid I want a billion now nothing less is adequate\nGrab and check, cashing it\nI was born addicted to the money\nDifference is now if finally found a way to manage it\nWhat you think I'm paid for nothing?\nYou must be mistaken someone\nI had to go make that fund and I'm trying to be great at something\nSpend not saving nothing\nFlying from the bay to London\nThey say that money talks but you're not saying nothing\nNow try and shade me, I'm like I guess\nWhy yes, you drive a Toyota, please define flex\nSign CDs and I sign breasts\nUnderstand, to these female fans, I'm sex\nListen...\n\nThis is the anthem\nTold the world I need everything and some, yeah\nTwo girls that's a tandem\nShe

la chanson Drifting par G-Eazy\r\n[Tory Lanez]\nGot this flight to London, I ain't pop no Xans for it\nIn case you was wonderin', I ain't even plan for it\nI just left L.A, barely caught the plane\nFuckin' TSA, swear a nigga ran for it\nAin't used to this fame shit\nThis you-all-know-my-name-shit\nMe, I'm just the same kid\nThat fucked around and made it\nFucked over my main chick\nDamn she was the main chick\nThinkin' 'bout the game\nI shouldn't have played, but I played it\n\n[Chris Brown]\nAnd now I'm missin' your love\nI'm faded once again, I don\u2019t know where I am\nBut I just know I'm driftin' far from you\nI'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart won't\nJust let me grow away from you\n\n\n\n\nDon't you know we're driftin' off, driftin' off?\nI know you think that it's my fault we're fallin' off\nAll this hope and disregard, driftin' off\nI know you think there ain't no fault, we fall apart\nAnd now I'm missin' your love\n\n[G-Eazy]\nI blame it on the distance\nWhy I'm fuckin' with these bitches\nThese numbers in my phone\nA text pops up, she's like, \"Who is this?\"\nYou probably got a mistress\nProbably every week it switches\nNow is this cause for concern?\nAnd should I be suspicious?\nI'm overseas trippin', a million miles away\nAnd she's still in L.A., my mom's out in the Bay\nAnd these overseas minutes add up, that's a lot to pay\nI can pay it, yeah I know, but it's the excuse I say\nShe's been tryna track me down\nI feel like I'm cattin' now\nDodgin' her when she's the one\nI'm out here trippin', actin' wild\nStart to wonder if I've changed\nI'm like how could that be now?\nWould these bitches be here really\nIf I wasn't rappin' now?\nNow tell me now\n\n[Chris Brown]\nI'm faded once again, I don\u2019t know where I am\nBut I just know I'm driftin' far from you\nI'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart won't\nJust let me grow away from you\nDon't you know we're driftin' off, driftin' off?\nI know you think that it's my fault we're fallin' off\nAll this hope and disregard, driftin' off\nI know you think there ain't no fault, we fall apart\nAnd now I'm missin' your love\n\n[G-Eazy]\nI'm just so conflicted\nIt's been so long since we've kicked it\nAnd I can't lie, I've missed it\nBut somewhere the current shifted\nAnd now I'm somewhere else\nFar away, feel like we drifted\nHard to face the facts\nI'm drinkin' to escape, and then get lifted\nGet swept under a rug\n'Til I'm trippin' on a pile\nGet a change, somethin' different for a while\nYeah we grew apart with time\nWe ain't kicked it in a while\nBut I still think about you now\nWithout you, see there's differences now\nBut shit happens, how could we have known?\nNothin' can prepare us\nFrom sleepin' at your parents\nNow to sold out shows in Paris\nTo parties at my hotel\nAshin' blunts off of my terrace\nTell me, how'd we ever come to live this careless?\nTell me now\n\n[Chris Brown]\nI'm faded once again, I don\u2019t know where I am\nBut I just know I'm

It is the fourth single (third in Europe) from Clarkson's second album, Breakaway (2004). The song, which Clarkson wrote at age 16, discusses the difficulties she faced due to her parents' divorce. \n\nCritically, \"Because of You\" garnered positive reviews by music critics, who praised Clarkson's vocals. The song became Clarkson's most successful single around the world; in the United States, it peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 and sold over 1.5 million digital downloads. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nIn 2007, Clarkson re-recorded the song as a duet with country music artist Reba McEntire for Reba's album Reba: Duets (2007). The duet version was released in Summer of 2007, reaching a peak of #2 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, becoming Clarkson's first official entry on that chart. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kelly+Clarkson/_/Because+of+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

According to the Since U Been Gone Songfacts, the song almost didn't make it onto the Breakaway album; when Clarkson heard the first, acoustic version of the tune, she didn't like it. It wasn't until it was given a rocking treatment that she warmed to the song. It was released in 2004 as the second single from the album in the U.S. and the first in Europe (see 2004 in music). Its lyrics recall a failed relationship in which the protagonist later expresses relief about the breakup. Clarkson, who sought interest in a more rock-oriented image, wanted to alter the song's original composition to allow more drums. The song has a punk-pop influence in drums and guitar riffs\n\nThe song was successful during 2005 (see 2005 in music), and was the second U.S. digital download to sell over one million copies. It reached number two on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and the Canadian airplay chart. In the UK, where \"Since U Been Gone\" was released as the first single from Breakaway, it reached number five and remained on the chart until the second quarter of 2006 (see 2006 in music). At the Grammy Awards of 2006, Clarkson received a Grammy Award for the song in the category of \"Best Female Pop Vocal Performance\". Since U Been Gone charted at ninety-seven in \"Blender Magazine's\" 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born.\n\nMuch of the song's melody and chords resemble those of The Strokes' \"Barely Legal\" on their album Is This It. \"Since U Been Gone\" writers Max Martin and Dr. Luke admitted on several occasions to being heavily influenced by The Strokes when writing the Clarkson song. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kelly+Clarkson/_/Since+U+Been+Gone\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song appears on Clarkson's sophomore album \"Breakaway\", from which it was released as the third US single in the second quarter of 2005. \n\nThe song tells the story of a failed relationship, which although initially started off well (your arms around me tight / everything felt so right), has left Clarkson devastated (now I can't breathe / no I can't sleep / I'm barely hanging on). She regrets having allowed herself to be vulnerable to him (opened up and let you in / you made me feel alright for once in my life), and has resolved that no matter how much she is actually hurting, he will not get the satisfaction of seeing her cry (you won't get to see the tears I cry / behind these hazel eyes). \n\nThe single was successful, peaking at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100, #9 in the UK, #4 in Canada, #6 in Australia, #7 in New Zealand and #4 in Ireland. \n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kelly+Clarkson/_/Behind+These+Hazel+Eyes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released between April 23, 2007 and June 11, 2007 to multiple countries. The single was a success for Clarkson (see its charts below). The music video involves Clarkson's ex-boyfriend attempting to drown her in her bathtub. Then, he heads to an airport to meet his new girlfriend, but he is wracked with guilt over what he has done. Apparitions of Clarkson are present in his car, and again at the airport to haunt him. Clarkson then resurfaces from the bathtub, as the ex-boyfriend wakes up from the dream, still in his car. When he walks out, Clarkson leaves the house and drives off in the car, leaving her ex-boyfriend behind. Clarkson also performs the song with her band in an empty white room, all wearing white clothes, during various scenes in the music video. It was written by Kelly Clarkson and Jimmy Messer and produced by David Kahne.\n\nThe single peaked at:\n#5 - Australia\n#8 - US\n#9 - UK\n#11 - Ireland\n#12 - Canada\n#19 - Germany, World\n#20 - New Zealand\n#23 - Bulgaria, Netherlands\n#27 - Switzerland\n#36 - Austria\n#39 - Sweden\n#44 - Belgium <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kelly+Clarkson/_/Never+Again\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Clarkson recorded her debut album with RCA Records after having won the highly-publicized first season of the television series American Idol in 2002. \n\nThough originally marketed as a pop musician, she eventually developed a more rock-oriented image. Her debut album, Thankful, was released in 2003 and debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 with almost 300,000 copies sold in its first week, now certified double platinum with over 4.5 million copies sold. Her first single, A Moment Like This, broke the record for largest leap to #1, shooting from #52 to #1, where it remained for two weeks. The second single, Miss Independent, was also a success, hitting #1 on the US Top 40 Mainstream chart and remaining there for six weeks. Further singles Low and The Trouble With Love Is were released but failed to mimic the success of her previous songs. However, Low managed to become a hit in Canada and reached #2. To date, Thankful has been certified 2x Platinum in the United States, Platinum in Canada and Gold in Australia.\n\nHer second studio album, Breakaway, was released in 2004 and debuted at #3 on the Billboard 200 and also at #3 in the UK album charts. It is her biggest selling album to date, selling over 6 million copies in the US and 15 million worldwide, making it the most successful album released so far by an American Idol alumnus. The first single in the US, Breakaway, peaked at #6 in the Billboard Hot 100 and #22 in the UK. Arguably her biggest single from the album, Since U Been Gone followed and peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #5 on the UK singles chart, marking the beginning of a successful worldwide music career for Clarkson. It won a Grammy award in 2006 for \"Best Female Pop Vocal Performance\". Behind These Hazel Eyes was the next single, reaching #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #9 in the UK chart. Because Of You was then released to huge sucess, hitting #1 in 5 countries, peaking at #7 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and UK singles chart. Clarkson\u2019s final single, Walk Away, peaked at #12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #21 on the UK singles chart. The album has been certified multi-platinum in at least 6 countries, going 7x Platinum in Ireland, 6x Platinum in the US and Australia, 5x Platinum in the UK and Canada, and 3x Platinum in New Zealand. The album won a Grammy award in 2006 for \"Best Pop Vocal Album.\"\n\nClarkson\u2019s third album, entitled My December, was released in 2007. It peaked at #2 on the US and UK album charts. Her first single, Never Again, was released worldwide and reached #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #9 on the UK singles chart. She then released Sober in America, which did not perform as well on the charts as Never Again, peaking at #10 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100. One Minute was subsequently released in Australia, peaking at #36 on the Australian singles chart. Don\u2019t Waste Your Time followed, peaking at #14 on the Australian singles chart. The album's somewhat disappointing performance may be attributed to ongoing negative press and poor publicity. Nonetheless, My December has been certified Platinum in the US, Australia and Canada, and Gold in the UK and Ireland.\n\nClarkson\u2019s fourth album titled All I Ever Wanted was released in early 2009. Debuting at #1, it received favourable reviews from critics worldwide. The lead single, My Life Would Suck Without You, advanced from #97 to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in its first week of release, breaking the record for the largest leap to the position in chart history. This marks the second time Clarkson has broken that record, the first time being with her single A Moment Like This. My Life Would Suck Without You also reached #1 in the UK charts, making it her first #1 there. Her second single from the album, I Do Not Hook Up, peaked at #20 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #36 on the UK singles chart. The third single from the album, Already Gone, was released on August 11, 2009 in America and the 21st in Australia. It has so far peaked at #12 in Australia, #15 in Canada, #23 in New Zealand, #66 in the UK, #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent 8 weeks at #1 on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary songs chart. All I Ever Wanted was announced as the fourth single from the album and was released on March 9, 2010. All I Ever Wanted has charted at #1 in the US, #2 in Australia and Canada, #3 in the UK and #6 in New Zealand, selling over 1.2 million copies worldwide so far. The album received a 2010 Grammy nomination for \"Best Pop Vocal Album.\"\n\nMr. Know It All, the first single from Clarkson\u2019s fifth album Stronger, debuted on August 30, 2011 during a live webcast hosted by the singer. The song was sent to radio for adds immediately after and was made available for download on September 5, 2011. It has since peaked in the top 20 of singles charts worldwide, including a #1 peak in South Korea, #1 in Australia, #4 in the UK, and #10 in the US, thus becoming her ninth top ten hit overall in the US. Stronger was released worldwide on October 24, 2011, charting at #2 in the US, #5 in the UK, #3 in Australia, and #4 in Canada. Stronger is her fifth consecutive album to debut within the top 3 in the US and has sold over a million copies worldwide since its release. Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You) was released in early 2012 to massive success; it became Clarkson's third #1 and tenth top-ten hit overall in the US, and likewise peaked in the top ten of countries worldwide. Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You) has since become Clarkson's biggest radio hit to date in the US and even topped the Billboard Dance charts, making Clarkson the only artist in history to have a #1 on Hot 100, Pop, Country, HAC, AC & Dance charts. Dark Side has since been announced and released as the album's third single worldwide.\n\nIn a career spanning over a decade, Clarkson has accumulated ninety-one number ones on the Billboard charts and eleven international number one singles, and has sold over 20 million albums worldwide. She is known for her vocal versatility and range. Her music has mainly dealt with themes of heartbreak, independence, and self-empowerment for women and young teens. Apart from her work in music, Clarkson has also ventured into television and film. Clarkson's film debut was in the romantic musical From Justin to Kelly (2003) and she also appeared in American Dreams as Brenda Lee, in Reba, on The Voice as a guest advisor, on Duets as a mentor and judge. Clarkson's musical work has also gained her numerous accolades, including three Grammy Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards, twelve Billboard Music Awards, four American Music Awards, two Academy of Country Music Awards, two American Country Awards, and a Women's World Award. In 2012, Clarkson was ranked nineteenth on VH1's list of \"100 Greatest Women in Music.\" In 2013, Clarkson was ranked number 105 on Joel Whitburn's \"Top 500 Artists Of All Time,\" number 5 on both \"Top Billboard 200 Female Artists\" and \"Adult Contemporary Artists,\" number 27 on \"Top Billboard 200 Artists,\" and number 75 on Billboard's \"Hot 100: Top 100 Artists.\" Billboard also ranked Clarkson as the 14th-best-selling artist of the 2000s and one of the top 200 album sellers of the Nielsen SoundScan era at number 187. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kelly+Clarkson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

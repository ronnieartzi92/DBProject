His mother is half Lebanese, half American Indian, his father Irish-American. While his peers got off on cheesy corporate rock and the kind of line-dancing tunes recently fashionable in Gap ads, Shawn was groovin to the blaxploitation funk Sly and the Isleys. Later, his local Baptist Church widened his appreciation of black music, but when he sang and played drums in its gospel choir, he discovered some of his white friends were racists who disapproved. F**k this, he thought, time to leave the Mid-West but not before playing in local band Lotus with future country superstar Martina Mcbride.\n\nNext stop Los Angeles. Already an able multi-instrumentalist (guitar, drums, perc,bass, etc) Shawn now set about developing his songwriting. There were bands, publishing deals, relationships,tours and day jobs: more notches on the bedpost of experience. Shawn was introduced to producers the Dust Brothers( post Paul's Boutique) and spent much time hanging out,drinking cappuccino's and making mix tapes from their dusted record collection. .This period also saw Shawn befriend the late Jeff Buckley, and somebody, somewhere has a tape of them jamming Honky Tonk Woman. \"Keith your fired\"!!!!!\n\nIn 1995, Shawn moved to London, where he recorded his solo debut for DJ Gilles Peterson's Talkin Loud label. For all the wrong reasons, the album was never released. It was soul destroying; a bit like somebody erasing 3 years of your life. Resolving to write and record on his own terms, Shawn kept working. He created the infamous \"Planet of the breaks\" series aswell as 5 volumes of \"Ape Breaks\" becoming the most sampled drummer of his generation in the process. He passed CDs of songs to friends with no agenda other than hope you enjoy it. As Shawn continued to do it his way, airplay garnered by a self-financed EP prompted several major labels to phone him. He had no intention of reboarding the corporate merry-go-round. Instead, he opted to sign a deal with Mark Jones at Wall of Sound. \"The labels got real credibility\" he says, \"Mark was happy to put out a record which sounds exactly like I wanted it to\".

Written and composed by the group's original tenor, Lew DeWitt, the song peaked in popularity in January 1966, spending four weeks at No. 2 on the Billboard magazine Hot Country Singles chart, and reaching No. 4 on the Hot 100 chart.\n\nIn the years since its release, \"Flowers on the Wall\" became one of the trademark songs of the Statler Brothers' 40-year career.\n\nThe song is a wryly humorous account of a man's isolated life. Recounting his sad, daily pursuits, \"Counting flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all, playing solitaire till dawn with a deck of fifty-one, smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo,\" are all acts of boredom and lost purpose as well as isolation. The Chorus of the song ends with the words: \"So don't tell me I've nothing to do.\"\n\nThe song gained exposure amongst a new generation after it was used by Quentin Tarantino in Pulp Fiction.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Statler+Brothers/_/Flowers+on+the+Wall\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

summer\nWhen the nights are hot and long\nAnd it's bad in December\nWhen they play those Christmas songs\n\nSo if you ask me and I don't tell you\nBet your sweet bottom dollar I lied\n'Cause there's never been one better\nThan Susan when she tried\n\nNo there's never been a woman\nWho could make me weak inside\nAnd give me what I needed\nLike Susan when she tried\n\nNo there's never been a

He joined them first as a temporary replacement for Lew DeWitt, after DeWitt heard him singing at a ski resort and recommended him. Following an audition in Nashville, Jimmy was contacted by the Statler Brothers and performed his first show with them on January 28, 1982, in Savannah, Georgia. Due to the debilitating effects of Crohn\u2019s Disease, Lew was unable to return to the stage with the Statlers, andJimmy was hired as a permanent replacement in August of 1982.<br> Fortune quickly lived up to his name. He wrote the group\u2019s second No. 1 hit, \u201cElizabeth,\u201d on their 1983 album Today, and followed that with two more No. 1 hits\u2013\u201cMy Only Love\u201d (from 1984\u2019s Atlanta Blue) and \u201cToo Much On My Heart\u201d (from 1985\u2019s Pardners in Rhyme). Fortune also wrote the top-10 hit \u201cForever\u201d from 1986\u2019s Four for the Show and co-wrote the top-10 hit \u201cMore Than a Name on the Wall\u201d from 1988\u2019s The Greatest Hits.<br> Jimmy has performed in all of the U.S. States, in Canadian Provinces, and in front of audiences as large as 100,000. He was part of the Statlers\u2019 annual Happy Birthday USA celebration in Staunton, Virginia, for 14 years. He also sang on many of the Statlers\u2019 gold, platinum, and double platinum recordings. Jimmy\u2019s career included The Nashville Network\u2019s popular \u201cThe Statler Brothers Show\u201d which aired for seven seasons and debuted in 1991 as the highest rated show for the network. Jimmy was privileged to perform at the White House on two occasions, once for President Ronald Reagan, and once for President George H. W. Bush. He also presented a special gift to actress Elizabeth Taylor by singing his song \u201cElizabeth\u201d to her for a birthday celebration.<br> Jimmy and The Statler Brothers were inducted into the GMA (Gospel Music Association) Hall of Fame on October 29, 2007, and inducted into the CMA (Country Music Association) Hall of Fame in June 29, 2008.<br> After the Statler Brothers retired on October 26, 2002, Jimmy seized the opportunity to launch a solo career to share new music with his fans. His first solo CD, When One Door Closes, was released August 2003 on Audium/Koch. He released a gospel album, I Believe, in June 2005, a Christmas CD, Feels Like Christmas, in 2006, a live concert DVD in 2007 a country CD, \u201cWindows\u201d in 2009, \u201cLessons\u201d in 2012, and \u201cHits and Hymns\u201d CD and DVD through Spring House Productions in 2015.

Especially on a debut album. Time and attention-strapped listeners size up an artist within a song or two, then move on or delve in further. Fortunately, it only takes Margo Price about twenty-eight seconds to convince you that you&#39;re hearing the arrival of a singular new talent. &quot;Hands of Time,&quot; the opener on &#39;Midwest Farmer&#39;s Daughter&#39; (coming Spring 2016, Third Man Records), is an invitation, a mission statement and a starkly poetic summary of the 32-year old singer&#39;s life, all in one knockout, self-penned punch. Easing in over a groove of sidestick, bass and atmospheric guitar, Price sings, &quot;When I rolled out of town on the unpaved road, I was fifty-seven dollars from bein&#39; broke . . .&quot; It has the feel of the first line of a great novel or opening scene in a classic film. There&#39;s an expectancy, a brewing excitement. And as the song builds, strings rising around her, Price recalls hardships and heartaches -- the loss of her family&#39;s farm, the death of her child, problems with men and the bottle. There is no self-pity or over-emoting. Her voice has that alluring mix of vulnerability and resilience that was once the province of Loretta and Dolly. It is a tour-de-force performance that is vivid, deeply moving and all true. <br><br> &quot;I&#39;m writing from my heart and life experiences,&quot; Price says. &quot;I knew I wanted to start the record with this song, but everyone in the band said, &#39;No, no, that&#39;s a bad move.&#39; And then Third Man said, &#39;We think this should be the first song,&#39; and I was like, &#39;Yes!&#39; It really just lays it out. If you can get through &#39;Hands of Time,&#39; the rest of the record is going to come very easily.&quot; <br><br> And indeed it does. The honky tonk comeuppance of &quot;About To Find Out,&quot; the rockabilly-charged &quot;This Town Gets Around&quot; and weekend twang of &quot;Hurtin&#39; (On The Bottle)&quot; all add fresh twists to classic Nashville country, while sounding like they could&#39;ve been hits in any decade. Meanwhile, the hard-hitting blues grooves of &quot;Four Years of Chances&quot; and &quot;Tennessee Song&quot; push the boundaries further west to Memphis (the album was recorded at Sun Studio). Throughout, producer Alex Munoz, engineer Matt Ross-Spang and the ace band help frame the material with spare, spacious arrangements, keeping the focus on Price&#39;s soulful vocals. <br><br> &quot;I think about an artist like Bobbie Gentry, who was able to mix country with soul,&quot; Price says. &quot;But really, I never set out to make a country soul record. It&#39;s just that I like Etta James, and I like Hank Williams, and sometimes those things come together and make nice little babies.&quot; <br><br> Her tastes developed early. Growing up in Aledo, Illinois (pop. 3,612), Price was surrounded by music -- everything from Tom Petty to the Statler Brothers. By middle school, she was singing in the choir and doing the national anthem at local football games. &quot;I was one of the only people who could sing it without changing keys,&quot; she says, with a laugh. With money from her eighth grade graduation, Price bought her first guitar and started writing songs, influenced by Joni Mitchell and Maria Muldaur. After dropping out of college, she moved to Nashville in 2003 and began the usual apprenticeship of open mic nights and networking. <br><br> Though she loved the friendliness of Music City, she says, &quot;I didn&#39;t feel like the glossy country music at the time had any space for me.&quot; On the advice of her great uncle, Bobby Fischer, a successful tunesmith with over 500 cuts by artists including George Jones, Tanya Tucker and Reba McEntire, she kept writing and honing her voice. She soon met bass player -- and future husband -- Jeremy Ivey, and formed a band called Buffalo Clover. They self-released three records and built a local following. Of course, the music biz being the minefield of dreams that it is, there were false promises and glittering temptations along the way (humorously catalogued in &quot;This Town Gets Around&quot;). &quot;I&#39;m so glad that I didn&#39;t sacrifice my integrity five or ten years ago,&quot; Price says. &quot;I had opportunities to. I remember meeting this one guy who said, &#39;I&#39;m a big producer and I know all these people on Music Row.&#39; So Jeremy and I tried to write some mainstream country songs. We created pen names because we didn&#39;t want anyone to know it was us -- Sylvia Slim and Sam Pickens. Together it was Slim-Pickens. We wrote a couple things, and I felt gross doing it. The producer guy didn&#39;t like it, and we didn&#39;t either. So it was, &#39;All right, I tried that, now I&#39;m just going to write for myself.&#39;&quot; <br><br> That decision was brought into even sharper focus by personal tragedy. &quot;I lost my firstborn son to a heart ailment,&quot; Price says, &quot;and I was really down and depressed. I was drinking too much. I was definitely lost. I did some things that I regret very much now that resulted in a brush with the law. Thank god I had my friends and family to keep me going. Coming through that, I thought, &#39;I&#39;m just going to write music that I want to hear.&#39; It was a big turning point.&quot; <br><br> With a new batch of songs, Price approached producers and labels. Nobody responded. Feeling like &quot;an outcast in Nashville,&quot; she turned her sights on Memphis instead. &quot;I once heard someone say, &#39;Nashville has glitz, but Memphis has grit.&quot;&#39;And I&#39;m like, &#39;Hey, I&#39;ve got grit too! I&#39;m gonna go to Memphis and make this record.&#39;&quot; <br><br> A year before, she had visited the legendary Sun Studio, as a tourist. &quot;The first time I walked in the room, the guide said, &#39;This is where Elvis stood.&#39; They have the X on the floor, and she said, &#39;It&#39;s rumored that Bob Dylan came in and kissed the X on the floor.&#39; So I waited for everybody to leave, then I got down on my knees, and thought, &#39;There, now I&#39;ve kissed both Bob Dylan and Elvis.&quot; <br><br> Her curiosity piqued by a &quot;Make Your Own Demo at Sun&quot; sign, Price met the house engineer, Matt Ross-Spang. &quot;He and I clicked right off the bat. I liked his energy. He had great ideas. We did a single, and it didn&#39;t turn out the way I wanted. But Matt was persistent about us working together again.&quot; To finance the sessions for &#39;Midwest Farmer&#39;s Daughter,&#39; Price and Ivey skipped the usual crowd-funding route, instead selling one of their cars, some instruments and even pawning her wedding ring. Price says, &quot;My husband said, &#39;This is all or nothing. I believe in you. I believe in this record. I&#39;ll sell our house if it comes down to it.&#39;&quot; <br><br> In Memphis, Price and her band worked the night shift, from 7pm-2am (after the museum had closed), cutting tracks live to analog tape. &quot;It was cool to do later sessions,&quot; she says. &quot;It&#39;s like doing shows, where you&#39;re singing at 11 o&#39;clock. My voice was already warmed up. It was such a relaxed vibe at Sun. And it felt haunted in a good way, like Elvis and Johnny were watching over us.&quot; <br><br> With the album done, Price says she shopped it to &quot;literally every label in Nashville.&quot; Except the one where it ended up. &quot;Honestly, I didn&#39;t think it would fit at Third Man,&quot; she says. &quot;Then a friend said, &#39;You&#39;re on Jack&#39;s radar, he wants to hear the record.&#39; I was like, &#39;No way.&#39; I sent it over, and it just felt like home. A good creative space to be involved in, and everyone is so down to earth. It was awesome when I met with Jack. He told me he thought my voice was a breath of fresh air, and that he loved the record.&quot; <br><br> As Price looks ahead to a busy 2016, full of touring and promoting &#39;Midwest Farmer&#39;s Daughter,&#39; she reflects on her hopes for what listeners might get from these songs. &quot;I hope that the record helps people get through hard times or depression. That&#39;s ultimately what music did for me in my childhood, and especially in my early adult years. It&#39;s about being able to connect personally with a song, and hopefully, it makes you feel not so lonely.&quot;", "img": null, "title": "MARGO PRICE - NOWHERE FAST TOUR -Particle Kid", "url": "http://phoenix.eventful.com/events/margo-price-nowhere-fast-tour-particle-kid-/E0-001-106552242-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Crescent Ballroom", "city": "Phoenix"}], "description": "The Statler Brothers were an American country music vocal group founded in 1955 in Staunton, Virginia.\n\nOriginally performing gospel music at local churches, the group billed themselves as The Four Star Quartet, and later The Kingsmen. In 1963, when the song \"Louie, Louie\" by the garage rock band also called The Kingsmen became famous, the group elected to bill themselves as The Statler Brothers. Despite the name, only two members of the group (Don and Harold Reid) are actual brothers and none have the surname of \"Statler\". The band, in fact, named themselves after a brand of facial tissue they had noticed in a hotel room (they joked that they could have turned out to be the Kleenex Brothers). Don Reid sang lead. Harold Reid, Don's older brother, sang bass. Phil Balsley sang baritone and Jimmy Fortune sang tenor after replacing original tenor Lew DeWitt in the early 1980s due to the latter's ill health. DeWitt died on August 15, 1990 of heart and kidney disease, stemming from complications of Crohn's disease.\n\nThe band's style was closely linked to their gospel roots. \"We took gospel harmonies,\" said Harold Reid, \"and put them over in country music.\"\n\nThe group remained closely tied to their gospel roots, with a majority of their records containing at least one gospel song. They produced several albums containing only gospel music and recorded a tribute song to the Blackwood Brothers, who influenced their music. The Statler Brothers also wrote a tribute song to Johnny Cash, who discovered them. The song was called \"We Got Paid by Cash\", and it reminisces about their time with Cash\n\nSince forming, the Statler Brothers have released over 40 albums. They received Grammy Awards in 1966 and 1973. Two of their best-known songs are their first big hit, Flowers on the Wall, and the socially-conscious Bed of Roses. Late in their career they had a regular variety show on the cable television channel then known as The Nashville Network. Throughout their career, much of their appeal was related to their considerable ability for comedy and parody that they frequently interspersed into their musical act; they were frequently nominated for awards for their comedy as well as their singing. They recorded two comedy albums as Lester Moran and the Cadillac Cowboys, and one-half of one side of the album Country Music Then and Now was also devoted to satirizing small-town radio stations' Saturday morning shows.\n\nThe group disbanded and retired after completing a farewell tour on October 26, 2002. Balsley and the Reid brothers continue to reside in Staunton, while Fortune has relocated to Nashville, where he is continuing his music career as a solo artist. He has released three albums as a soloist. The Statlers continue to be the most awarded act in the history of country music.\n\nSince the Statlers' retirement in 2002, Don has pursued a second career as an author. He authored or co-authored three books: Heroes and Outlaws of the Bible, Sunday Morning Memories, and You'll Know It's Christmas When.... He and Harold co-wrote a history of the Statler Brothers titled Random Memories released in February 2008.\n\nThe Statler Brothers have been credited as the first country music act to transfer the genre's nostalgia from a rural to a suburban setting.

His signature booming left-hand and fleeting right created a unique sound that can be heard on his recordings as a sideman with the John Coltrane Quartet in the 1960s and on his 80-plus albums as a leader. Tyner&#39;s most recent project for McCoy Tyner Music/Half Note Records is his first solo effort in almost a decade titled Solo: Live From San Francisco. The release is the third for his label and features eleven solo vignettes recorded at the Herbst Theater in 2007. <br><br>Tyner&#39;s blues based piano style, replete with sophisticated chords and an explosively percussive left hand has transcended conventional styles to become one of the most identifiable sounds in improvised music. His harmonic contributions and dramatic rhythmic devices form the vocabulary of a majority of jazz pianists. <br><br><br><br>Born in 1938 in Philadelphia, he became a part of the fertile jazz and R&B scene of the early &#39;50s. His parents imbued him with a love for music from an early age. His mother encouraged him to explore his musical interests through formal training. <br><br>At 17 he began a career-changing relationship with Miles Davis&#39; sideman saxophonist John Coltrane. After Coltrane left Davis&#39; band, Tyner joined Coltrane for the classic album My Favorite Things (1960), and remained at the core of what became one of the most seminal groups in jazz history, The John Coltrane Quartet. The band, which also included drummer Elvin Jones and bassist Jimmy Garrison, had an extraordinary chemistry, fostered in part by Tyner&#39;s almost familial relationship with Coltrane. <br><br>During his tenure with John Coltrane, Tyner also held the piano chair on seminal albums such as Live At The Village Vanguard in 1961, Ballads, Live at Birdland in 1963, Crescent, A Love Supreme, The John Coltrane Quartet Plays, Kulu Se Mama, Ascension, Sun Ship, and Meditations. &quot;He was like a big brother to me,&quot; Tyner recently said of Coltrane. &quot;He looked out for me and taught me an incredible amount. It was a wonderful period in my life.&quot; <br><br>In 1965, after over five years with Coltrane&#39;s quartet, Tyner left the group to explore his destiny as a composer and bandleader. Among his major projects is a 1967 album entitled The Real McCoy, on which he was joined by saxophonist Joe Henderson, bassist Ron Carter and fellow Coltrane alumnus Elvin Jones. His 1972 Grammy-award nomination album Sahara, broke new ground by the sounds and rhythms of Africa. Since 1980, he has also arranged his lavishly textured harmonies for a big band that performs and records when possible. <br><br>In the summer of 2005, Tyner joined forces with the Blue Note Jazz Club in New York and became the first client of Blue Note Management. That summer, Tyner began work on some unique projects, including performances with tap-dancer Savion Glover and the development of the Impulse! Septet, featuring his trio with some of today&#39;s top hornmen. <br><br>Tyner&#39;s partnership with the Blue Note has led to the formation of his own record label, aptly titled McCoy Tyner Music. The label is a subsidiary of the Blue Note&#39;s <br>In-House record label, Half Note Records. The label launched on September 11, 2007, upon the release of Tyner&#39;s latest CD, &quot;Quartet&quot; featuring Joe Lovano, Christian McBride, and Jeff &quot;Tain&quot; Watts. <br><br>McCoy Tyner&#39;s second release for the McCoy Tyner Music label, titled GUITARS, was released on September 23, 2008. The recording features the stellar rhythm section of Tyner, Ron Carter, and Jack DeJohnette with four modern guitarists (and one banjo) of our time: Bill Frisell, Marc Ribot, John Scofield, Derek Trucks, and Bela Fleck. The package is a CD/DVD that includes 3 hours of multi-angle viewing capabilities. In August 2009, Tyner released his third recording for McCoy Tyner Music, a solo piano performance recorded live in San Francisco during the summer of 2007 titled Solo: Live From San Francisco. The recording featured Tyner playing eleven vignettes, both standards and original compositions. <br><br>Tyner has always expanded his vision of the musical landscape and incorporated new elements, whether from distant continents or diverse musical influences. More recently he has arranged for big bands, employed string arrangements, and even reinterpreted popular music. Today, Tyner has released nearly 80 albums under his name, earned four Grammys and was awarded Jazz Master from the National Endowment for the Arts in 2002. He continues to leave his mark on generations of improvisers, and yet remains a disarmingly modest and spiritually directed man.

The band, which also included drummer Elvin Jones and bassist Jimmy Garrison, had an extraordinary chemistry, fostered in part by Tyner&#39;s almost familial relationship with Coltrane. <br><br>During his tenure with John Coltrane, Tyner also held the piano chair on seminal albums such as Live At The Village Vanguard in 1961, Ballads, Live at Birdland in 1963, Crescent, A Love Supreme, The John Coltrane Quartet Plays, Kulu Se Mama, Ascension, Sun Ship, and Meditations. &quot;He was like a big brother to me,&quot; Tyner recently said of Coltrane. &quot;He looked out for me and taught me an incredible amount. It was a wonderful period in my life.&quot; <br><br>In 1965, after over five years with Coltrane&#39;s quartet, Tyner left the group to explore his destiny as a composer and bandleader. Among his major projects is a 1967 album entitled The Real McCoy, on which he was joined by saxophonist Joe Henderson, bassist Ron Carter and fellow Coltrane alumnus Elvin Jones. His 1972 Grammy-award nomination album Sahara, broke new ground by the sounds and rhythms of Africa. Since 1980, he has also arranged his lavishly textured harmonies for a big band that performs and records when possible. <br><br>In the summer of 2005, Tyner joined forces with the Blue Note Jazz Club in New York and became the first client of Blue Note Management. That summer, Tyner began work on some unique projects, including performances with tap-dancer Savion Glover and the development of the Impulse! Septet, featuring his trio with some of today&#39;s top hornmen. <br><br>Tyner&#39;s partnership with the Blue Note has led to the formation of his own record label, aptly titled McCoy Tyner Music. The label is a subsidiary of the Blue Note&#39;s <br>In-House record label, Half Note Records. The label launched on September 11, 2007, upon the release of Tyner&#39;s latest CD, &quot;Quartet&quot; featuring Joe Lovano, Christian McBride, and Jeff &quot;Tain&quot; Watts. <br><br>McCoy Tyner&#39;s second release for the McCoy Tyner Music label, titled GUITARS, was released on September 23, 2008. The recording features the stellar rhythm section of Tyner, Ron Carter, and Jack DeJohnette with four modern guitarists (and one banjo) of our time: Bill Frisell, Marc Ribot, John Scofield, Derek Trucks, and Bela Fleck. The package is a CD/DVD that includes 3 hours of multi-angle viewing capabilities. In August 2009, Tyner released his third recording for McCoy Tyner Music, a solo piano performance recorded live in San Francisco during the summer of 2007 titled Solo: Live From San Francisco. The recording featured Tyner playing eleven vignettes, both standards and original compositions. <br><br>Tyner has always expanded his vision of the musical landscape and incorporated new elements, whether from distant continents or diverse musical influences. More recently he has arranged for big bands, employed string arrangements, and even reinterpreted popular music. Today, Tyner has released nearly 80 albums under his name, earned four Grammys and was awarded Jazz Master from the National Endowment for the Arts in 2002. He continues to leave his mark on generations of improvisers, and yet remains a disarmingly modest and spiritually directed man.

Sar & The Real McCoy, was a German Eurodance group, who are best known for their international hits Another Night in 1993 and Run Away in 1994.\n\nReal McCoy was the brainchild of German rapper and producer Olaf \"O-Jay\" Jeglitza. After having released a few limited edition 12\" singles in Germany under the name \"The Alliance\" with friend Frank \"Quickmix\" Hassas, their first major breakthrough came in December  1989 when a cover of the Technotronic hit \"Pump Up The Jam\" went to #16 on the German singles chart.\n\nAt this point, the act was faceless so for the second single, the original track It's On You, singer Patsy Petersen and 'rapper' Shampro were enlisted to join the group. O-Jay felt uncomfortable being the frontman so Shampro mimed O-Jay's raps. The single, on its release in 1990, climbed to #11 in Germany. An album \"On The Move\" was also released.\n\nAfter this things went a little quiet for a while until they hooked up with David Brunner, Head of A&R at Hansa Records. He was impressed by a song O-Jay had co-written called \"Another Night\" but was dissatisfied with Patsy's vocals.\n\nConvinced he had a hit on his hand, Brunner persuaded O-Jay to let him release the new version of \"Another Night\" with Patsy (miming Karin Kasar's vocals) and O-Jay to replace Shampro as the new \"M.C. Sar & The Real McCoy\". It was a #18 hit in Germany in 1993 and all over continental Europe, followed by the album \"Space Invaders\" but then Clive Davis at Arista Records in the USA showed some interest. He had already had success taking Ace of Base to the States and now wanted to do the same with a re-branded Real McCoy.\n\nA new video was made, another singer Vanessa Mason was found to form a trio and the single shot to #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in late 1994, also reaching #1 on Radio & Records magazine's CHR/Pop Airplay chart. It was also re-released in the United Kingdom, where it had only reached #61 the previous year. This time it was far more successful and within three weeks had climbed to #2, selling more than 312,000 copies and also reached #1 in Australia. The Follow-up, Automatic Lover (Call for Love) reached #52 on the Billboard Hot 100, #10 in the UK, and #5 in Australia. \"Run Away\" became the follow-up single to \"Automatic Lover\"; it became the groups second #1 single in Australia and also got to #3 in the USA in early 1995 (and #6 in the UK). A freshened-up US album called \"Another Night\" was released, with some new tracks, also with vocals by Karin Kasar, and Real McCoy were awarded Best New Act at the American Music Awards in 1995.\n\nLove & Devotion was a #11 hit in the UK in April of that year, and Come And Get Your Love, a cover of the song by Redbone, peaked at #19 on both sides of the Atlantic ending a great year for the act. Shortly afterwards, Patsy left the act and was replaced by Lisa Cork.\n\nIn 1997, Real McCoy returned with a new single and album called One More Time, this time with Vanessa Mason and Lisa Cork actually performing on the record. The album was co-written with American songwriter/producer Brent Argovitz who brought Lisa Cork into the band. The single itself was released in many nations around the world on vinyl and CD-Maxi Singles with a total of 18 remixes amongst all the releases. One More Time (the single) peaked at #27 on the Billboard Hot 100. It became a Top 20 hit on both Rhythmic/Dance format radio and on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. However, \"One More Time\" completely missed the UK Top 75. A few other singles were released such as a cover of the Shania Twain hit, (If You're Not In It For Love) I'm Outta Here! and I Wanna Come (With You) (which \"Bubbled Under\" the Hot 100). Before long the group disbanded.\n\nAlthough the group decided to stop recording together, a completely new line-up were hired to form a \"new\" Real McCoy in 1999, much like the producers of 2 Unlimited had done a year earlier. Jason, Gabi and Ginger recorded a brand new version of the 1990 hit It's On You, which was released only in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In 2000, they also released a new song titled \"Hey Now\". Both singles failed to chart.\n\nO-Jay went on to produce and re-mix for several German artists such as Yvonne Catterfeld, B3, Daniel K\u00fcblb\u00f6ck and ATC.\n\nIn 2003, O-Jay released a solo CD single under the A45 record label (Germany) with several mixes of his winning eurodance formula called \"Nite to Remember\", a song very reminiscent of the Real McCoy tracks with his rap and female vocals.\n\nSeveral \"greatest hits\" compilations have been issued in recent years, and O-Jay started his own weblog in 2004, in which he finally revealed that the group's biggest hits had in fact been performed by Karin Kasar. He has also speculated that yet another Real McCoy group was being lined up without his permission, but so far they have not been launched. O-Jay still performs under the name Real McCoy and collaborated with Ich Troje to represent Poland at the Eurovision Song Contest 2006. The song, Follow My Heart, failed to qualify for the grand final.\n\nIn early 2007, O-Jay started a new record label, Phears Music, with a distribution partnership with Sony BMG in Germany. He also released a brand new four track digital single \"People Are Still Having Sex\", a cover of LaTour's 1980's house hit, in anticipation of a new album and tour for Real McCoy in 2008. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Real+McCoy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Celebrating decades of recording and touring that have nearly singlehandedly reshaped the definition and scope of the blues via the infusion of exotic sounds from the Caribbean, Africa and South Pacific, the two-time Grammy winning singer, songwriter, film composer, guitarist and multi-instrumentalist was feted with the Lifetime Achievement for Performance Award at the 13th Annual Americana Honors and Awards.Ive been performing for over 50 years, and to be recognized for the road Ive traveled means the world to me, says Mahal, who during the show performed Statesboro Blues which he first recorded on his eponymous 1968 debut album on dobro with a band that included Cooder and Don Was. I could not have done this without the audience that has been so supportive of me throughout my musical journey. It was a fantastic night and I was thrilled to be there and celebrated among such other outstanding American musical treasures like Jackson Browne and Flaco Jimenez, whose music and talent I am a fan of. It certainly represented a diversity of musical styles and culture. Thats what Im talking about essay help!The night at the legendary Ryman Auditorium capped another extraordinary year for Mahal, which began with a performance at the Gregg Allman Tribute Concert in Atlanta and included playing on the entire Blind Boys of Alabama Christmas album; performing as part of the Bonnaroo Superjam on a bill featuring Derek Trucks with Chaka Khan, Eric Krasno from Soulive, renowned R&B/blues session drummer James Gadson, David Hidalgo from Los Lobos and Susan Tedeschi; and playing and recording with Van Morrison in Dublin.Since the release of 2008s Maestro, his most recent studio recording which received a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Blues Album, Mahal has been busier than ever touring and recording at a whirlwind pace with old friends and fellow musical sojourners. In 2010, after being nominated for Entertainer of the Year by the Blues Foundation, he joined Jimmy Fallons Late Night studio band The Roots as a special musical guest on the Rolling Stones classic Shine a Light. He also opened in Lake Tahoe for Bob Dylan. One of the highlights of the following year as performing a special opening solo set for Eric Clapton and Wynton Marsalis at Lincoln Center; Mahal also performed several songs with his two fellow legends. The concert was recorded and released as a CD and CD/DVD entitled Wynton Marsalis & Eric Clapton Play The Blues Live From Jazz at Lincoln Center.After starting 2012 producing and performing (vocals, guitar and banjo) on Vusi Mahlaselas live album Say Africa, Mahal joined the critically acclaimed Experience Hendrix tour for a three week run that included performances by everyone from Buddy Guy, Dweezil Zappa and Robby Krieger to Robert Randolph, Jonny Lang, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Keb Mo and Living Colour. Energized anew after the Sony Legacy release of two collections celebrating the riches and rarities of his musical legacy the two disc set The Hidden Treasures of Mahal Mahal 1967-1973, featuring a full live 1970 concert from Royal Albert Hall, and The Complete Columbia Albums Collection box set, featuring all of his LPs from 1968-1976 the bluesman enjoyed a wildly productive 2013.That spring found Mahal singing and playing harmonica on Further Down the Road from Claptons Old Sock album, and performing as a featured guest at Claptons Crossroads Guitar Festival at MSG (NYC) where over 30 of the worlds greatest guitarists played sidemen to each other over two nights. Mahal jammed with The Allman Brothers Band featuring David Hidalgo and Cesar Rosas of Los Lobos and in a special unplugged acoustic set with Keb Mo.That June marked the release of the all-star soundtrack album to Ghost Brothers of Darkland County, a supernatural blues n roots musical featuring music and lyrics by John Mellencamp, a libretto by author Stephen King and production by T-Bone Burnett. Mahal appeared on Home Again with Sheryl Crow, Dave Alvin and Phil Alvin, in addition to Tear This Cabin Down and What Kind of Man Am I. He later performed on Vicksburg Blues on actor/recording artist Hugh Lauries album Didnt It Rain and a new rendition of his song Winding Down on the Sammy Hagar & Friends recording. He capped the year with An Evening with Taj Mahal at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles.Mahals career has been full of and defined by colorful twists and turns, unexpected whimsical ventures and a commitment to a muse that has long preferred freewheeling innovation to conformity. So theres always the challenge of finding the right words and phrases to capture just what hes meant to American music over the past half century. Miles Mellough, who wrote the stark and honest, no holds barred liner notes for The Complete Columbia Albums Collection, captures the complexities perfectly on several posts he penned on his blog Birds with Broken Wings after the box set came out.Heres the thing, plain and simple, he writes. Taj Mahal has always been a conundrum; a man who is capable of mirroring many things to many people, and the reason why is because hes an enigma an alchemist and a contrarianThrough his music hes been a dirt farmer, a man of gentry, and a Mississippi riverboat gambler. Hes played the role of the pious country preacher of old South camp meetings to a chain gang prisoner breaking rocks in the hot, midday sun. Hes been a hard-boiled harp player with a gold tooth and process blowing gritty on the South side of Chicago to a West Indies fishing boat captain sipping Banana Daiquiris with a St. Kitts womanLike the blues tree with its many roots, Mahal has become the sum of many parts. But if you were to strip him of the elements that have come to define him publicly, youd no doubt find that beneath it all hes really just a simple man with a harp, a steel guitar, and a banjo in his rucksack; a man making music with a whole hell of a lot of heart and soul.In another post, Mellough ruminated on the global fusion approach Mahal has taken to the blues, which has caused its share of controversy: While purists may have sometimes had issues with his unusual blend of acoustic blues mingled with the sweet sounds of Africa, the West Indies and South Pacific Islands, I believe Mahal elevated the music form to an entirely new plane. By approaching the blues from a global perspective, Mahal presents it as part of a broader musical palette, a world canvas. Using traditional country blues as a starting place, Mahal perfumes the pot by mixing a spicy concoction of Afrocentric roots music, a blues gumbo kissed by reggae, Latin, R&B, Cajun, Caribbean rhythms, gospel, West African folk, jazz, calypso, and Hawaiian slack key. The savory dish he serves is both a satisfying and uplifting stew that actually transforms singin the blues into something to be very happy about.The Early YearsThe parents of Harlem born Henry St. Claire Fredericks, Jr. (Mahals given name until his dreams of Gandhi, India and social tolerance inspired him to change it) came of age during the Harlem Renaissance and instilled in their son a sense of pride in his West Indian and African ancestry. Growing up in Springfield Massachusetts, Mahals father was a jazz pianist, composer and arranger of Caribbean descent (called The Genius by Ella Fitzgerald) who frequently hosted musicians from the Caribbean, Africa and the U.S. His mother was a schoolteacher and gospel singer from South Carolina. Henry Sr. had an extensive record collection and a shortwave radio that brought sounds from across the world into their home.Back in the 1950s, Springfield was full of recent arrivals from all over the globe, allowing Mahal to understand and appreciate many world cultures. We spoke several dialects in my house Southern, Caribbean, African and we heard dialects from eastern and western Europe, he says. In addition, musicians from the Caribbean, Africa and all over the U.S. frequently visited the Fredericks home, and Mahal became even more fascinated with roots the origins of the various forms of music he was hearing, the path they took to reach their current form, and how they influenced each other along the way. He threw himself into the study of older forms of African-American music, which the major record companies of the day largely ignored.Mahals parents started him out on classical piano lessons, but he soon expanded his scope to include clarinet, trombone and harmonica and discovered his talent for singing. His stepfather (his mother remarried after Henry Sr. was killed in a tragic accident) owned a guitar and Mahal began playing it in his early teens, becoming serious when a guitarist from North Carolina moved in next door and taught him the various styles of Muddy Waters, Lightnin Hopkins, John Lee Hooker and Jimmy Reed and other titans of Delta and Chicago blues.Before music became a viable option, Mahal who first began working on a dairy farm at 16 and was a foreman by 19 thought about pursuing a career in farming. Over the years, this ongoing passion has led to him performing regularly at Farm Aid concerts. In the early 60s, he studied agriculture (minoring in veterinary science and agronomy) at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, where he formed the popular U. Mass party band, the Elektras. After graduating, he headed west in 1964 to Los Angeles, where he formed the Rising Sons, a six-piece outfit that included guitarist Ry Cooder.The band opened for numerous high-profile touring artists of the 60s, including Otis Redding, the Temptations and Martha and the Vandellas. Around this same time, Mahal also mingled with various blues legends, including Howlin Wolf, Muddy Waters, Junior Wells, Buddy Guy, Lightnin Hopkins and Sleepy John Estes. He and Cooder also worked during this period with the Rolling Stones, and in 1968, he performed in the classic film The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus.This diversity of musical experience served as the bedrock for Mahals first three recordings: Taj Mahal (1967), The Natchl Blues (1968) and Giant Step (1969). Drawing on the eclectic sounds and styles hed absorbed as a child and a young adult, these early albums showed signs of the musical exploration that would become Mahals hallmark in the years to come. In the 1970s, Mahal carved out a unique musical niche with a string of adventurous recordings, including Happy To be Just Like I Am (1971), Recycling the Blues and Other Related Stuff (1972), the GRAMMY-nominated soundtrack to the movie Sounder (1973), Mo Roots (1974), Music Fuh Ya (Music Para Tu) (1977) and Evolution (The Most Recent) (1978). The type of blues he was playing in the early 70s showed an aptitude for spicing the mix with exotic flavors that kept him from being an out and out mainstream genre performer.Mahals recorded output slowed somewhat during the 1980s as he toured relentlessly and immersed himself in the music and culture of his new home in Hawaii. Still, that decade saw the well-received release of Mahal in 1987, as well as the first three of his celebrated childrens albums on the Music For Little People label. He returned to a full recording and touring schedule in the 1990s, including such projects as the musical scores for the Langston Hughes/Zora Neale Hurston play Mule Bone (1991) and the movie Zebrahead (1992). Later in the decade, Mahal released a series of recordings with the Phantom Blues Band, including Dancing the Blues (1993), Phantom Blues (1996), and the two GRAMMY winners, Seor Blues (1997) and the live Shoutin in Key (2000). Overall, he has been nominated for nine GRAMMY Awards.During this same period, Mahal continued to expand his multicultural horizons by joining Indian classical musicians on Mumtaz Mahal in 1995, and recording Sacred Island, a blend of Hawaiian music and blues, with the Hula Blues Band in 1998. Kulanjan, released in 1999, was a collaborative project with Malian kora master Toumani Diabate (the kora is a 21-string west African harp). Mahal felt that this recording embodied his musical and cultural spirit arriving full circle. He recorded a second album with the Hula Blues Band, Hanapepe Dream, in 2003, followed by the European release Zanzibar in 2005. His 2008 Heads Up International recording Maestro marked the 40th anniversary of his recording career and featured performances by Ben Harper, Jack Johnson, Angelique Kidjo, Los Lobos, Ziggy Marley and others many of whom have been directly influenced by Mahals music and guidance.What inspires me most about my career is that Ive been able to make a living playing the music that I always loved and wanted to play since the early 50s, Mahal says. And the fact that I still am involved in enjoying an exciting career at this point in time is truly priceless. Im doing this the old fashioned way and it aint easy. I work it and I earn it. My relationship with my audience has been fun, with great respect going both ways! I am extremely lucky to have fans who have listened to the music I choose to play and have stayed with me for 50 years. These fans have also introduced their children, grandchildren and in some cases great-grand children to this fabulous treasure of music that I am privileged to represent. Its very exciting, to say the least.Like ancient culture, he adds, the people are as much a part of the performance as the music. Live communication through music, oh yeah, its right up there with oxygen!", "img": null, "title": "TAJ MAHAL", "url": "http://charlotte.eventful.com/events/taj-mahal-/E0-001-108207899-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "McGLOHON THEATER at Spirit Square", "city": "Charlotte"}], "description": "Ziggy Alberts is a home-schooled songwriter, free surfer & environmental enthusiast based out of Byron Bay, Australia.

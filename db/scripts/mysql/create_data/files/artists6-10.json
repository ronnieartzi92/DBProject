The performance, based on a prose piece written by Rogoff that engages with and interprets Franz Kafka\u2019s short story \u201cThe Burrow,\u201d explores our shrinking privacy and how the disruptive quality of sound shapes our personal and social lives. An interactive discussion will follow the performance.<p>Structured as a fictional lecture that is delivered to an imagined class, Burrow: Revisited offers an interaction with literature that is non-academic and explorative, probing exciting new ways of transmitting, teaching, and enjoying literary work. Alex Waterman, a New Music composer who is deeply interested in how to create artificial soundscapes in order to provide multi-dimensional imaginary landscapes for the audience, has created an original score. <p>Through this performance, sparked by Rogoff\u2019s experiences as a teacher, the beauties of literature are revealed and become transformative. Rogoff\u2019s short story, upon which the performance is based, is about a moment of conflict between a patient and a therapist triggered by the intrusion of the memory of another patient at a psychological clinic. Social media and the speed of communications impact our cultural atmosphere, our quality of discourse, and our political environment, creating anxieties similar to the psychological puzzles explored by Kafka. By staging the performance as a \u201cfake\u201d lecture, the typical classroom setting will be transformed and theatrically disrupted while Waterman\u2019s score explores the subtly ubiquitous threat of noise pollution, such as cell phones, cars, and planes. <br></p></p></p>", "title": "World Premiere of BURROW: REVISITED", "url": "http://eventful.com/portland_me/events/world-premiere-burrow-revisited-/E0-001-110362637-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Maine College of Art", "date": "2018-02-02 19:00:00"}, {"city": "Philadelphia", "description": null, "title": "Tech N9ne", "url": "http://philadelphia.eventful.com/events/tech-n9ne-/E0-001-110533090-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Theater of the Living Arts", "date": "2018-05-31 23:59:00"}, {"city": "Portland", "description": " with Remo Drive, Foxx Bodies<br> &quot;I don&#39;t want to be in an emo band anymore,&quot; proclaims Sorority Noise frontman Cameron Boucher. &quot;But I have no problem with people calling us that, because in the strictest of senses, we are an emotionally driven band.&quot;That, is Sorority Noise in a nutshell: part of a movement, but also discrete and determined to break free from the pack. Truth be told, the Connecticut-based quartet Boucher, guitarist/vocalist Adam &quot;Scuff&quot; Ackerman, bassist/vocalist Ryan McKenna and drummer Charlie Singer have always operated a little differently than most of their peers.For starters, Boucher attends the University of Hartford for jazz saxophone and music production, while guitarist Ackerman studies acoustic and upright bass. But it&#39;s not just their unorthodox musical chops that set the band apart in the underground punk scene. With the release of their Topshelf Records debut, Joy, Departed, Sorority Noiserecently named one of the 100 Bands You Need to Know in 2015 by Alternative Pressare poised to break out in a big way.It&#39;s clear from the opening track, &quot;Blissth,&quot; which creaks and swells like the best of Brand New&#39;s softer side; the buoyant energy and self-reflection of first single &quot;Art School Wannabe,&quot; featuring Modern Baseball&#39;s Jake Ewald; the Pinkerton-era Weezer stomp of &quot;Nolsey;&quot; and the heartbreaking, album-closing &quot;When I See You (Timberwolf).&quot;Joy, Departed is more than just the best iteration of Sorority Noise to date; the album also marks a creative shift for Boucher, who draws musical influence from a diverse crop of acts spanning Regina Spektor and jazz trumpeter Chet Baker to The Smiths and Broken Social Sceneand previously spent time fronting screamo band Old Gray. In some ways, the singer says he approached the creative process like writing his very first album.[Before this record], everything was just scattered songs I&#39;d been working on for two or three years,&quot; Boucher explains. &quot;Without having an outlet to put them out, I was just sitting on them. We&#39;d pull a song out and jam it and put it on an album. Same with the lyrical content: It was spread over a much larger time. Going into this record, I&#39;d used up all of my old songs. Joy, Departed was written over a three-month period of my life. There are points where I look back and look forward, but it&#39;s definitely more lyrically focused on a set time and experience in the present. There&#39;s a sense of cohesion on this record.&quot;Boucher started Sorority Noise in late 2013 with friends as an outlet to explore musical styles outside his work in Old Gray. The group then recruited Ackerman and issued their debut full-length, Forgettable, in May 2014. Much buzzand tours with buzz bands Modern Baseball and The Hotelier followed, as did a split 7&quot; with Somos and the arrivals of Singer (whom Boucher had played with in Old Gray) and McKenna.Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Joy, Departed is Boucher&#39;s candidness, addressing heavy lyrical topics some of his peers wouldn&#39;t dream of covering. Look no further than &quot;When I See You (Timberwolf),&quot; which paints the forlorn portrait of a close friend spiraling through the throes of addiction, a situation Boucher saw manifest itself in his own life.&quot;It&#39;s about someone getting over drug issues while another person falls into it,&quot; the singer says. &quot;It&#39;s like, &#39;How could you let this happen to yourself after you&#39;ve seen what the people you love went through?&#39;&quot;&quot;Charlie went through years of opiate problems, and I went with him at points,&quot; Boucher continues openly about his bandmate. &quot;We&#39;re both 100% percent fine now, but there&#39;s so many people having drug problems and a lot of bands who play it safe and don&#39;t want to talk about it. I think it&#39;s important to be shown in modern music. I like to be honest about my past and talk about things that have had me down. As a lyricist, you are responsible for the people who care about your music.&quot;That&#39;s ultimately what makes Joy, Departed such an important album: It&#39;s life, warts and all, sung by someone who&#39;s experienced it firsthand. It&#39;s not always rosy, but it&#39;s real. Above all, it&#39;s an album meant to be experienced as a body of work, not single songs plucked piecemeal or shuffled on a streaming service. And for Boucher, he hopes it will show critics and fans alike Sorority Noise has something to say.&quot;The pomp and circumstance that comes with the bastardization of depression in emo music the entire song broken into one lyric, into one Tumblr post, and having that represent the band? I don&#39;t want that,&quot; Boucher concludes, circling back to his earlier point. &quot;I want someone to put on a whole record and connect to it that way. I don&#39;t intend to write a line that&#39;s a tattoo lyric or something that could be deciphered easily. The emo culture has a tendency to adapt itself to that, and I want to be more than that.&quot;", "title": "Sorority Noise", "url": "http://portland.eventful.com/events/sorority-noise-/E0-001-109696474-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Analog Cafe & DRD Records Little Theater", "date": "2018-03-17 19:00:00"}, {"city": "Hamburg", "description": " <p>With An Object, their fourth full-length album, No Age has forgone the straight and narrow route, landing in a strange and unexpected place, feet planted in fresh, fertile soil. This new LP finds drummer/vocalist Dean Spunt exploding from behind his kit, landing percussive blows with amplified contact mics, 4-string bass guitars, and prepared speakers, as well as traditional forms of lumber and metal. Meanwhile, guitarist Randy Randall corrals his previously lush, spastic, sprawling arrangements into taught, refined, rats&#39; nests. Lyrically Spunt challenges space, fracturing ideological forms and complacency, creating a striking new perspective that reveals thematic preoccupations with structural ruptures and temporal limits.<br><br> As the title An Object suggests, these eleven tracks, produced by No Age and their long-time collaborator Facundo Bermudez, who recorded tracks on their Weirdo Rippers LP (2007) and toured with the band in support of Everything In Between (2010), are meant to be grasped, not simply heard. Whether in the fine grit of Randall&#39;s sandpaper guitar scrapes on Defector/ed, or Spunt&#39;s percussive stomp and crack on Circling with Dizzy and An Impression, created largely through the direct manipulation of contact mics, these are songs that pivot on the sheer materiality of music-making. Spunt&#39;s creative deployment of bass guitar accented through a modified speaker on the beautifully catchy I Won&#39;t Be Your Generator is a case in point: even at its most lyrical an Object incorporates the process of its creation into the very backbone of the songs. Still, this is hardly a work of avant garde noise music or l&#39;art concret. These songs are hummable, political, and, on tracks like, No Ground, C&#39;mon, Stimmung, and Lock Box (in which Spunt&#39;s vocals bear a passing resemblance to the Ramones), recognizably punk.<br><br> Elsewhere, on tracks like Commerce, Comment, Commence and A Ceiling Dreams of a Floor, No Age take this kernel and transform it, literally blurring the sound and bathing the album in a swirl of layered guitar and a bright haze of static alongside an ethereal, haunting vocal that conjures shoegaze as much as hardcore. What these two approaches share is an understanding of sound as a material, something to be shaped, handled, and worked over. It is an aesthetic in which the relationships between guitar, percussion, and vocals-as well as those between rhythm and melody-become relationships between things.<br><br> These relationships are diagrammed into An Object at every level. In Collaboration with close friend and Grammy-nominated designer Brian Roettinger (5 E.P.&#39;s, Nouns_, L_osing Feeling, Everything In Between) the band has performed, recorded, produced, and prepared and assembled the entirety of the physical packaging of An Object, including jackets, inserts, and labels, taking on the roll of manufacturer, artist, and musician until the roles trip on themselves and individual parts lose their distinct meanings, demanding to be considered as a whole. It is this sense of the total work of art - call it the DIY gestamtkunstwerk - that underlines An Object as the culmination of two years of touring, writing, and performing, finding No Age moving into new terrain at the height of their powers.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/noagela/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.facebook.com</a></p>", "title": "No Age (Noise/Punk, LA)", "url": "http://hamburg.eventful.com/events/no-age-noisepunk-la-/E0-001-109261790-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "Germany", "venue": "Hafenklang", "date": "2018-03-21 21:00:00"}, {"city": "Bangalore", "description": "Just as the universe mums the din while the earth releases it to its inhabitants, the sound and its vibrations can play the role of both, nuisance and healer.

Echo which deliberates a world of fear, insecurity and noise. And Silence, because inside us is a unique world private to oneself where peace, forgiveness and happiness are the choices we can make.\n\nAfter her last exhibition that showcased spontaneity with flamed alcoholic inks on tiles, Lovina celebrates her indulgence with acrylics taking it into a new wave of expressions this time around. The Echoes & Silence collection speaks a special language that seeks to subtly present the many facets of life and the beauty of living it harmoniously by choice, not just by chance.\n\nHere&#39;s a peak into what one can expect at the exhibition that also reflects Lovina&#39;s spiritual side:\n\n&#39;Chakras&#39; that align to offer power and stability to tame the outward turmoil; or, the &#39;5 Elements&#39; that showcase the grace of &#39;Panchcha Bhootashuddi&#39; where unexplained disturbances in life get bypassed.

For most of the band's career, they consisted of Anne Dudley, J.J. Jeczalik and Gary Langan. The band was signed to ZTT Records, and the label's founders, Trevor Horn and Paul Morley were members of the band from 1983 to 1985. Langan left the band in 1987 and Dudley and Jeczalik split Art of Noise in 1990 but both retained the rights to the name. Dudley, Horn, Morley and 10cc member Lol Creme formed a group named The Image of A Group in 1997, then took the Art of Noise name from 1998 to 2000 after J.J. Jeczalik allowed the name to be used.\n\nAnne Dudley, Jonathan Jeczalik (\"J.J.\"), and Gary Langan were members of producer Trevor Horn's in-house studio band in the early '80s before they formed the Art of Noise, an experimental synthpop group whose music was an amalgam of studio gimmickry, sampling, and synthesized beats.  Music journalist Paul Morley, co-founder of the ZTT record label with Horn, provided art direction and was also a member of the band.  The Art of Noise took material from a variety of sources: hip-hop, rock, jazz, R&B, traditional pop, found sounds, and noise all worked their way into the group's distinctly postmodern soundscapes.\n\nDudley was the center of the group, having arranged and produced material for Frankie Goes to Hollywood, ABC, and Paul McCartney before forming the Art of Noise. The group signed with Trevor Horn's ZTT label, releasing their first EP, Into Battle With the Art of Noise, in 1983. The following year, the group released the full-length (Who's Afraid Of?) The Art of Noise!, which featured the hit single \"Close (To the Edit).\"\n\nAfter \"Close (To the Edit),\" the group parted ways with Horn, Morley and ZTT, releasing In Visible Silence in 1986; the album included the U.K. Top Ten hit \"Peter Gunn,\" which featured Duane Eddy on guitar. Re-works of the Art of Noise, an album of remixes and live tracks, was released that same year. In No Sense? Nonsense!, released in 1987, saw the band experimenting with orchestras and choirs, as well as horns and rock bands. The next year, the trio released a greatest-hits collection, The Best of the Art of Noise, which featured their collaboration with Tom Jones on Prince's \"Kiss\" (original: Kiss). The collaboration was an international top 20 hit, particularly reaching #5 on the U.K. Singles Chart.\n\nBelow the Waste (1990) captured the band experimenting with world music; it received a lukewarm critical and commercial reception. The following year, a low-key remix album directed by Killing Joke's Youth called The Ambient Collection appeared. Later in the year, the Art of Noise broke up. Dudley eventually worked with Killing Joke's Jaz Coleman and Phil Collins.  \nTrevor Horn,  Anne Dudley, and Paul Morley reunited in 1999 for a new album, The Seduction of Claude Debussy. Lol Creme (ex-10CC), a long-time friend of Trevor Horn, was added to the lineup.\n\nIn 2001, \"The Heart of Noise: A Tribute to the Art of Noise\" was released online as a tribute to Art of Noise.\nIn 2004, \"The Abduction of the Art of Noise\" was released - a tribute album consisting of new versions of various Art of Noise songs, primarily \"Moments in Love\" and \"Beat Box (Diversion 1)\".  One of the contributors was the group Art of Silence, which featured former Art of Noise member J.J. Jeczalik. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Art+of+Noise\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Whether moving bodies at the world's biggest electronic festivals, or hand-crafting digital gems in the studio, the producer / DJ duo of U-Tern and Oligee are responsible for some of the funkiest, toughest, and most diverse dance music today. \n\nAfter spending years writing, producing, DJing and digging for vinyl, U-Tern and Oligee linked up in LA to forge something groundbreaking. They took their shared '80s baby tastes - relentlessly groovy R&B, boombox worthy hip-hop, soaring electropop hooks - and mashed them together in remixes for everyone from Chromeo and Foster The People to Breakbot and techno godfather Juan Atkins. Original jams like \"All Night\" and \"Dirty Talk\" (supported by dance music luminaries like Alan Braxe and Busy P) took Oliver's back-to-the-future sound even further, while high-powered collaborations with A-Trak (\"Disco Nap\") and Destructo (\"LA Funky\") brought the duo to the festival circuit, where they kept hands in the air all summer.\n\nWith the release of their Fool's Gold EP Mechanical, Oliver push their hybrid sound to even funkier new horizons. The stadium worthy opener \"MYB\" perfectly segues into the moody strut of \u201cNight Is On My Mind,\u201d before shifting gears with the hands-in-the-air ecstasy of \u201cControl\u201d and riding off into the sunset on the title track\u2019s cinematic pulse. With non-stop DJ sets on deck (complete with Oligee's live keyboard riffs) and even more new music, there's no telling where the beats will take them next. \"Oliver is all over the map,\" says U-Tern. \"But we're going to have a good time no matter what.\"\n\n2) Born in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina, William Oliver Swofford began singing as an undergraduate at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the early 1960s. He was a member of two music groups: The Virginians and, later, The Good Earth.\n\nOliver's clean-cut good looks and soaring baritone were the perfect vehicle for his July 1969 #3 single \"Good Morning Starshine\", from the pop-rock musical Hair. In October 1969 Oliver reached #2 with Rod McKuen's melodious ballad \"Jean\", the theme from the Oscar-winning film The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie. Oliver performed both hits on a number of TV variety shows and specials in the late 1960s, including the Ed Sullivan Show. Later recordings had much less commercial success: \"Sunday Mornin'\" peaked at #35 in December 1969, and \"Angelica\" stalled at #97 in April 1970. His follow-up \"I Can Remember\" from July 1970 missed the Hot 100.\n\nDespite his vocal talents, Oliver could not sustain more hits and he later made a career in business. A short-lived attempt to team up with Karen Carpenter in the late 1970s was unsuccessful. In 1983, People magazine ran a feature article on Oliver, describing a happily married father who kept his distance from the music business. In the late 1990s Oliver was diagnosed with cancer, and he died in Shreveport, Louisiana, on the same date that Screamin' Jay Hawkins, Charles Schulz, and Tom Landry all died.\n\n3) The Belgian Singer is the representative of Belium in Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2008 with the song 'Shup Up'. He won Junior EuroSong 2008 in Belgium which gained him the ticket to Limassol in November 2008 to represent his nation in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest. \n\n4) The Romanian rock band's story begins in 2005, when after four years marked by major member changes, the band 41 shed its skin to reveal what we know today as Oliver: four experienced musicians who are not afraid to experiment, mercilessly blending their uncensored ideas into music. Oliver oozes passion, energy, poetry and the band spares no efforts in making live shows a real treat. And if you\u2019re confused about their lyrics, this might mean you understand them.(Doru Puscasu - vocals, Mircea Moroianu - guitar, Horia Gridan - bass, Mihai Zorca - drums) \n\n5) Born in Hong Kong. Formerly vocalist and guitarist from the band Little Beautiful Brand and becoming a solo singer-song-writer now. Released two solo records \"Grace\" and \"Freddie and King\" under 89268 in Hong Kong. working on his third album which will also be his first ever chinese album. Singles released on www.89268.com and www.oliverching.com for free download. \n\n6) The American band was formed in 2000 by Eric Fischer, Stephan Hawkes, Ben Sprague, and Cory Van Name. They have three albums to their name: their self-titled EP, released in 2000; Quiet Life, released in 2002; and the 2-cd EP set Coming Back in Waves and Time Demands Pain, released in 2005. They are characterized by an upbeat, indie-rock sound. \n\n7) Oliver is also a Finnish rock band.\nwww.oliverband.net\nwww.myspace.com/oliverfin\nAlbum: Kauempaa sen tajuaa (2009, OMB-Records Finland)\n\n8) A Sydney indie rock band founded by Jason Slattery and David Orwell with at least 2 EPs recorded:\n\nMr Blue Sky (1994, Ra Records, 4509988962)\nStars\nTouchdown\nThe Conductor\nEveryone's A Fool\nBuild Your Own Highway\n\nBlack Mountain Songs (1995)\nBox Of Birds\nMr Blue Sky\nGrate\nSuperfine\nOne Ninety\nSo You've Been Created\nCherry Shoes\n\n9) Oliver is an English Vocaloid developed by PowerFX and new VOCALOID company, VocaTone.

The group consists of guitarist Diego Farias, bassist Raad Soudani, vocalists Gus Farias and Myke Terry, and drummer Nick Ursich. They debuted with their first EP, The Concept of Dreaming in (2010). This was followed with their debut full-length album Via (2011) and their sophomore album No Sleep in 2014. Both albums peaked at No. 1 on the iTunes Rock and Metal charts.\n\nThe band started in 2009 when guitarists Diego Farias and Daniel Braunstein were writing music together. Singers Michael Barr and Diego's brother, Gus Farias, joined the band along with Raad Soudani on bass and Chris Khoury playing the drums. Their first EP, 'The Concept of Dreaming,' was announced to be released December 2009 but publication came to a halt when guitarist Daniel Braunstein left the band due to time constraints with university and was no longer able to participate actively in the band. He was replaced by guitarist Daniel Schwartz. After being signed on with Mediaskare Records and Outerloop Management in early November 2010, the band quickly released their debut EP 'The Concept of Dreaming' on November 16, 2010.\n\nIn early 2011, the band played several tours throughout North America with such bands as Arsonists Get All the Girls, The Contortionist, and Structures. The band's debut full-length, VIA was released and distributed through Mediaskare Records on September 27, 2011 and reached #1 on the iTunes Rock & Metal Charts. 2011 also marked the same year that drummer Chris Khoury parted ways with the band, leading to Daniel Schwartz taking over the drums at shows, who then quit later that year. In early 2012, they found a new permanent replacement drummer, Nick Ursich. Since late 2011 Volumes has only had one guitarist. Between April and May 2012, Volumes went on a tour of Europe alongside bands Veil of Maya, Betraying the Martyrs and Vildhjarta. Between January and February 2013, the band toured the United States with Of Mice & Men, Woe, Is Me, The Devil Wears Prada, Texas in July and Capture the Crown. On July 15, 2014, Volumes released their second full-length album No Sleep which reached again at #1 on the iTunes Rock and Metal Charts featuring their single, \"Vahle\". Between late August and late September of 2014, the band supported Crown the Empire on the Welcome to the Resistance tour, along with The Family Ruin, Secrets, and Ice Nine Kills. Volumes later contributed to Fearless Records' compilation Punk Goes Pop 6 with their cover of \"Hold On, We're Going Home\" by Drake featuring Majid Jordan.\n\nIn summer 2014, Volumes completed their first full US Vans Warped Tour run.\n\nVolumes announced in November 2015 that vocalist Michael Barr had departed from the band due to \"different musical direction and taste\", and Born of Osiris member Joe Buras will be stepping in for current touring duties until their new vocalist is announced. Myke Terry, formerly of the metalcore band Bury Your Dead, has since replaced Barr.\n\nVolumes departed from Mediaskare Records and signed a recording contract with Fearless Records, releasing their single \"Feels Good\" on June 16, 2016. On June 29, 2016, the band re-released their studio albums 'Via' and 'No Sleep' through their own record label 91367 Records.

Wright on\nAs long as you've got stars in your eyes you keep me coming back to you\n\nOh I wanted you but your eyes don't shine like they used to\nGod I want it all but you guys don't like all the old songs\nSo write on, write on.

They classify their music as 'intestindie' as it contains a mixture of different genres. The group's members are Hayley Mary (vocals), Samuel Lockwood (guitar), Heather Shannon (piano/keyboard) and Nik Kaloper (drums).\n\nWe are a thing that came out of a few chance meetings at Sydney University. You see, Heather and Hayley had been playing music together for a while. Inevitably came the journey south from Byron - being their place of youth - to Sydney for a foray into higher education. Nik and Sam were studying at Sydney University also. And you know, for some reason you just meet people...\n\nWe don't have a manifesto as such, but we do have definite intentions in what we do. We wish to play pop, but with a recognizable element of self-awareness. We wish to be emotional, but with a sense of certainty that our audiences won't walk away thinking that we take ourselves too seriously. What is paramount is an attempt to push this thing called the culture industry in some direction which makes it more human. (I guess this is all too ambitious but oh well... We do try)\n\nHeather studies piano at the conservatorium and reads a bit too much Russian literature. Hayley looks toward her personal canon of pop ballads for guidance in all situations and believes we must return to the way life was prior to the poker machine epidemic. Nik is a science student who imbues his drumming with formulas and mathematical complexities. Sam is a country music-playing, Marx-spouting communist with a love of all things meaningfully subversive.\n\nThe Jezabels have released 3 EPs: Dark Storm (2010), The Man is Dead (2009) and She's So Hard (2009).\n\nTheir debut album Prisoner was released in September 2011. The Jezabels won the 2012 ARIA Award for Best Independent Release for their album, Prisoner.\n\nOfficial site: http://www.thejezabels.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Jezabels\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He takes the acoustics further with the husband & wife pairing, The Long Lost.\n\nOnce working from a studio in Santa Monica, California. A young Daedelus began noodling Bass Clarinet notes, and soon after attempting Double-Bass. After an ill-fated affair pondering classical and jazz, rave paved the way, and a burgeoning record collection fueled Daedelus\u2019 artistic creativity, preparing the path to his first full length release, Invention. Inspired by '30s, '40s and '70s grooves, and defying genres such as downtempo and hip-hop, Daedelus gradually begins to venture into the L.A. afterdark.\n\nThe music on Invention combines multiple instruments, including non-traditional ones such as computer printers, toy pianos, and among other bent and mis-used, the Omnichord. Daedelus invites local MC talents Busdriver and Sach to flow over the masterful bonus versions of \"Quiet Now\" and \"Pursed Lips Reply.\" Invention unfolds in dynamic ranges of emotion.\n\nDaedelus has also released \"Her's Is >\" on Phthalo, an e.p. \"The Household\" on Scott Herren\u2019s Eastern Developments imprint and has produced \"The Weather\" album for Mush Recordings. Then \"Rethinking The Weather\", \"Meanwhile...\", \"A Gent Agent\", \"Of Snowdonia\", \"Axe Murderation\", \"Exquisite Corpse\", \"Denies The Day's Demise\", \"Fair Weather Friends\", \"Love To Make Music To\" and it's SPs for Ninjatune recordings, \"Friends of Friends vol. 1\" T-shirt EP along side Jogger, \"Bespoke\" is the his most recent LP. \n\nDaedelus is now found pouring lighter fluid on the turntables at dublab.com, fretting endlessly over his Monome assisted live sets, and generally thinking in threes and fours.\n\nHe has worked with Laura Darling, Busdriver, Frosty, Inara George, Bilal, Baths, MF Doom, Prefuse73, Absract Rude, Madlib, Flying Lotus, Pigeon John, Hrishikesh Hirway,Radioinactive, High Priest (Anti-Pop Consortium), N'fa (1200 Techniques), Taz Arnold and Om'mas Keith(Sa-Ra), Michael Johnson, CYNE, TTC, Carlos Nino(Build an Ark, Amoncontact)+ many more. His live show, which utilizes Monome, has amazed audiences across the US, Europe, Trans-Tasman, South East Asia, China, Middle East and Japan.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Daedelus\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Experienced flameworkers may\u00a0contact the instructor\u00a0to schedule a certification class only.** Are you fascinated by this old-world process that uses glass, flames and gravity? Are you just curious about trying out the Glass Shop?\u00a0In this 2 hour Artisan Workshop you will begin by receiving a brief studio orientation, safety training and demonstration of the Solid Sculpture project. The rest is hands-on torch time creating your very own hard candies.\u00a0 How is that done? Glass rods and colored frit (crushed glass) are heated and shaped in the two thousand degree flame of an oxygen-propane bench torch. You can make Murano-style glass candies in all shapes and colors you choose. Your new creations will be annealed in a kiln overnight and can be taken home the next day.\u00a0Please bring paper and pencil for sketching projects. Closed-toe shoes and natural fibered clothing are required.\u00a0 One to one tool trainings and classes can be made by appointment. For more details please\u00a0contact Molly Jackson. PLEASE NOTE:\u00a0The glass shop and it&#39;s associated classes are for adults aged 18 or older only.\u00a0All non-member students please\u00a0fill out this one-time registration form\u00a0prior to attending a class.

The band consists of vocalist Ida No and guitarist/synthesist/general producer Johnny Jewel.\n\nWhile the band's early work blended noise rock with electropop, their later work incorporates Italo disco. The band is known for evolving through the years since their original collaboration, and experimenting with various musical genres. \n\nThey have released a number of albums since the early 2000s, their most recent being 2008's Deep Gems.\n\nGlass Candy was formed by Ida No, from Vancouver, Washington and Johnny Jewel, from Austin, Texas, in 1996. The two began working together in Portland, Oregon, just across the Columbia River from No's hometown of Vancouver, Washington. No describes their early work as \"droney and weird.\" Their first two singles, which they self-released under the name \"Glass Candy & the Shattered Theatre\", were \"Metal Gods\" (2001) and a cover of Josie Cotton's \"Johnny Are You Queer\" (2002). They toured with The Convocation Of... in 2001, and released a live album that year on Vermin Scum. Their first studio album, Love Love Love, was issued on Troubleman Unlimited in 2003. A second full-length followed on Troubleman the next year. Jewel founded Italians Do It Better with Mike Simonetti as a subsidiary of Troubleman. In 2007 Glass Candy released their third album B/E/A/T/B/O/X on this label to considerable critical praise. In late 2008, a rarities, b-sides and remix album was released under the name Deep Gems. In a review of Deep Gems, Spin Magazine referred to the band as \"an eccentric Portland pair\" that \"spook the dance floor\".\nGlass Candy songs were used for a Chloe runway show, as well as used by Karl Lagerfeld for the Spring/Summer '08 Chanel Haute Couture fashion show and the Fall/Winter one of '08/'09.\nRecently Glass Candy's \"Digital Versicolour\" was used in the soundtrack to Nicolas Winding Refn's feature length film Bronson.\n\nCurrent members\nIda No - vocals\nJohnny Jewel (formerly known as John David V.) - drums, programming\n\nFormer members\nAvalon Kalin - drums\nJimi Hey - drums\nDusty Sparkles - saxophone and drums\n\nDiscography\n\nSmashed Candy (Vermin Scum, 2001)\nLove Love Love (Troubleman Unlimited, 2003)\nLife After Sundown (Troubleman Unlimited 2004)\nIko (Troubleman Unlimited, 2005)\n\"I Always Say Yes (12\" Main)\" (Italians Do It Better, 2007)\nB/E/A/T/B/O/X (Italians Do It Better, 2007)\nMiss Broadway (Vinyl, 12\")\" (Italians Do It Better, 2008)\nDeep Gems (Italians Do It Better, 2008) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Glass+Candy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

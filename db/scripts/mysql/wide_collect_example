Edited by CLS Videos Twitter:..."}, "description": "\"I See Fire\" is a song from The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, written, composed and performed by English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran. It appears as the end-credit song for the film. It entered the UK Singles Chart at number 13 and reached number 1 in New Zealand on its sixth week, marking Sheeran's first number-one single in the country.\n\nChosen by The Hobbit director Peter Jackson, Sheeran saw the film, wrote the song, and recorded most of it on the same day. The song was released as a digital download on 5 November 2013. Its music video was released on the same day. The song has also since been nominated for a Satellite Award for Best Original Song.\n\nPeter Jackson discovered Sheeran through his daughter Katie in early 2013, and then met him while he was touring in New Zealand. When searching for an artist to record the end-credit of The Desolation of Smaug, Peter Jackson and producer/co-writer Fran Walsh decided, following the advice of their daughter, to ask him to write and perform the song. The Hobbit was the first book Sheeran ever read, and he was a fan of both Tolkien's and Jackson's work.\n\nIn only one day, Sheeran watched the film at Park Road Post, immediately went to a room to write the song, and recorded most of it. Despite having never played the violin, he chose to perform it himself via overdubbing. Sheeran commented on the production stating, \"I got the chance to produce and play all the instruments on it apart from the cello (... and I) managed to learn (the) violin for a day\". Flight of the Conchords' touring cellist Nigel Collins added cello parts, dictated by Sheeran. Pete Cobbin from Abbey Road Studios, responsible for mixing the musical score of The Desolation of Smaug by Howard Shore, was at Park Road at the same time and mixed \"I See Fire\", with Jackson being present during the whole recording <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ed+Sheeran/_/I+See+Fire\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Lyrically, Ed sings about meeting someone at a bar and eventually falling in love with her and her body over time.\n\nSheeran had teased the song through a tweet that he had posted on January 5, 2017. The video had a colon that would then merge into a human body, which also can signify the meaning behind the song. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ed+Sheeran/_/Shape+of+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The protagonist feels sorry for himself and the only way he can handle the pain is by drowning his sorrows in drink.\nSheeran sings of getting drunk on several other + tracks. He recalls getting inebriated after breaking up with his girlfriend when she went to university on \"U.N.I..\" \"I'm still drunk by the end of the night. I don't drink like everybody else. End up forgetting things about myself.\") \"Give Me Love\" tells a similar story where the protagonist tells his former beau, \"Maybe tonight I'll call you/ After my blood turns to alcohol/ No, I just wanna hold ya.\"\nThe official music video is the first one filmed by Sheeran that he stars in as well. It also features his current girlfriend, Scottish-Swedish singer-songwriter Nina Nesbitt, plus a partying cat. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ed+Sheeran/_/Drunk\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Sheeran was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire before moving to Framlingham, Suffolk. In his time in Suffolk, he was known to have flourished as a hidden talent when it came to music. He learned guitar at a very young age, and began writing songs during his time at Thomas Mills High School in Framlingham. By the time Sheeran had left school, he was already certain that music was going to play a major part in his life, and therefore studied at Access To Music in Norwich before moving to London which improved his chances of getting gigs.\n\nSheeran began recording in 2005, which lead to the release of his first EP, The Orange Room EP. Sheeran also released two albums, a self titled one in 2006 and Want Some? in 2007 gaining little attention. After Sheeran moved to London and had done extensive gigging, performing songs from his EP and albums, as well as ones which he had recently written, he decided to release another EP, You Need Me in late 2009. However, it wasn't until February 2010 that Sheeran began to get noticed after he posted a video through SB.tv displaying his diverse style. This video led to mainstream rapper Example asking Sheeran to tour with him. Throughout 2010, Sheeran began to be seen by more and more people over the internet through Youtube and his fan-base grew incredibly, with him also getting credit from The Independent newspaper, England football captain Rio Ferdinand and even Elton John. Sheeran released three EP's in 2010, Loose Change, which features one of his most known songs, \"The A Team\", Songs I Wrote With Amy, and Ed Sheeran: Live at the Bedford, a live EP recorded in October. During the year, Sheeran also went to the US, where he was discovered by international superstar Jamie Foxx, who asked Sheeran to perform on his radio show, which gained him some fans in the US. By the end of the year, Sheeran was seen to be one of the best unsigned artists in the country. \nOn 9 January 2011, Sheeran released his final independent EP, No.5 Collaborations Project featuring appearances by grime artists including Wiley, JME, Devlin and Ghetts. With this EP, Sheeran gained mainstream attention for reaching number 2 in the iTunes chart, without any promotion or label. He was listed as a 'special guest' on Devlin's 2011 'Bud, Sweat and Beers' mini tour alongside Griminal and Tinchy Stryder. Songfacts reports that after signing for Atlantic Records in January 2011 \"The A Team\" was released as the first single from his debut album on June 12, 2011.\n\nSheeran's debut album + containing the singles The A Team and Lego House is certified 6x Platinum in the UK. The album has also won Sheeran two Brit Awards for British Breakthrough Act and Best British Male Solo Artist. At the 56th Annual Grammy Awards Sheeran gained a nomination for Best New Artist. \n\nHe received further fame for contributing the track entitled \"I See Fire\" to Howard Shore's soundtrack to the movie \"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug\" in 2013.\n\nx the second studio album by Sheeran was released in 2015. The album went straight to number one in both the UK and the US. x has had five singles thus far Sing, Don't, Thinking Out Loud, Bloodstream and Photograph.\n\nSheeran recently was awarded with an Honorary Doctorate by the University Campus Suffolk (UCS). The ceremony is later this year. \n\nDiscography:.\n\nAlbums:\n\n2011 - +\n2014 - x\n2017 - \u00f7\n\nEPs:\n\n2005 - The Orange Room\n2006 - Ed Sheeran\n2007 - Want Some?\n2009 - You Need Me\n2010 - Loose Change\n2010 - Songs I Wrote With Amy\n2010 - Live At The Bedford\n2011 - No 5 Collaborations Project\n2011 - One Take\n2011 - iTunes Festival: London 2011\n2011 - Thank You\n2012 - The Slumdon Bridge\n2012 - iTunes Festival: London 2012\n\nSingles:\n\n2011 - The A Team\n2011 - You Need Me, I Don't Need You\n2011 - Lego House\n2012 - Drunk\n2012 - Small Bump\n2012 - Give Me Love\n2013 - I See Fire\n2014 - Sing\n2014 - Don't\n2014 - Thinking Out Loud\n2015 - Bloodstream\n2015 - Photograph\n2017 - Shape of you\n2017 - Castle on the Hill\n2017 - Galway Girl <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ed+Sheeran\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Daddy's with you in your prayers\nNo more crying, wipe them tears, daddy's here, no more nightmares\nWe gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it\nLaney uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it\n\nWe're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls\nWhen it whirls, when it twirls two little beautiful girls\nLookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you\nDaddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news\n\nI try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems\nThe harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me\nAll the things growing up his daddy, that he had to see\nDaddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did\n\nWe did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me\nBut things have gotten so bad between us I don't see us ever being together\nEver again like we used to be when we was teenagers\nBut then of course everything always happens for a reason\n\nI guess it was never meant to be\nBut it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is\nBut no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep\nMaybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream\n\nNow hush little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\n\nI know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\nWe fear how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise mama's gon' be alright\n\nIt's funny, I remember back one year, when daddy had no money\nMommy wrapped the Christmas presents up, and stuck 'em under the tree\nAnd said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em\nI'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying\n\n'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job\nBut his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom\nAnd at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed\nOr shot up on the block and your mom\n\nWas saving money for you in a jar\nTryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college\nAlmost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it\nAnd I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart\nAnd it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart\n\nMom and dad was arguin' a lot so mama moved back\nOn the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment\nAnd dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara\nAnd that's when daddy went to California with his CD\nAnd met Dr. Dre and flew you and mama out to see me\n\nBut daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me\nThen you started seeing daddy on the TV\nAnd mama didn't like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it\nPapa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit\nAnd it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it\nI'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand\n\n'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud\nNow I'm sittin' in this empty house\nJust reminiscing lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out\nTo see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now\n\nWow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here\nLaney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here\nI like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?\nShh, mama's only gone for the moment\n\nNow hush little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\n\nI know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\nWe fear how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise mama's gon' be alright\n\nAnd if you ask me too, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird\nI'mma give you the world\nI'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you\nI'll do anything for you to see you smile\n\nAnd if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine\nI'mma break that birdies' neck\nI'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya\nAnd make him eat every karat, don't fuck with dad (ha ha)", "youtube": {"duration": 259, "date_published": "2009-12-25 04:20:46", "video_id": "S9bCLPwzSC0", "description": "Playlist Best of Eminem: https://goo.gl/AquNpo Subscribe for more: https://goo.gl/DxCrDV Music video by Eminem performing Mockingbird.

It deals with the themes of rap music's effect on society and the misunderstanding that critics and parents have towards his message. Eminem uses the song to refute critics who have accused him of promoting violence to young people, saying that committing a crime is ultimately up to the offender.\n\nHe also explains that his music has an advantage to young people, claiming that his music is a relief from boredom and depression.

Singer Skylar Grey was inspired to write and record the demo with Alex da Kid when she felt she was in an abusive romantic relationship with the music industry. Eminem wrote the verses and chose Barbadian singer Rihanna to sing the chorus; their past experiences of domestic violence influenced the collaboration. Recording sessions were held in Ferndale, Michigan, and Dublin, Ireland. Backed by guitar, piano and violin, the track is a midtempo hip hop ballad with a pop refrain and describes two lovers who refuse to separate despite being in an abusive love\u2013hate relationship.\n\nInterscope Records released the single in August 2010. Critics praised its melody but were divided on thematic aspects such as poignancy and accuracy. Eminem promoted the song with performances at the 2010 Electronic Entertainment Expo, the MTV Video Music Awards and festivals. The music video, directed by Joseph Kahn, stars Dominic Monaghan and Megan Fox in a violent relationship and shows Eminem and Rihanna in front of a burning house. The clip had a mixed reception due to scenes of domestic violence. Critics suggested that the song and its accompanying video were influenced by Eminem's and Rihanna's respective relationships with ex-lovers Kimberly Scott and Chris Brown.\n\nMagazines listed \"Love the Way You Lie\" among the best of 2010 and of Eminem's work. The song won awards and received five Grammy nominations. His best-selling single, it was number one on 26 weekly record charts, including the United States' Billboard Hot 100 for seven weeks. The single sold more than 5 million copies in the US and was the best-selling song of 2010 in the United Kingdom. Musical acts such as Cher Lloyd and The Band Perry performed cover versions. Rihanna has said that a theme of domestic violence, a topic on which she claims many people do not have insight, is what makes the song effective. She later recorded \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\", narrated mostly from the female perspective. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Eminem/_/Love+The+Way+You+Lie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It tells the story of his attempts to calm a violent community of rappers. He speaks openly about problems with The Source magazine and its editor Benzino, as well as Murder Inc. Records, and explains the feud between Ja Rule and 50 Cent, which Eminem felt went way beyond the Jay-Z vs. Nas feud. The song finishes as Eminem offers a truce to his enemies. Like Toy Soldiers features prominent sped-up sampling from \"Toy Soldiers\" by Martika.\nThe song's video, released in 2004, which depicts Eminem's fellow D12 member Proof being gunned down in a drive-by shooting, took a sudden and tragic turn in the early hours of April 11, 2006, when Proof was actually shot and killed at the CCC nightclub on Detroit's 8 Mile Road.\nCameo appearances in the video include 50 Cent, Obie Trice and D12.\nDeceased rappers Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., Big L and former D12 member Bugz are also shown at the end of the music video to show the fatal consequences of rap wars.\nEminem leaves out a word in this song when referring to Dr. Dre's own feuds. This word is believed to be \"Suge\", a reference to Suge Knight with whom Dr. Dre had problems in the mid 90's.\n\"Like Toy Soldiers\" was included on Eminem's compilation album Curtain Call: The Hits in 2005.\nIn addition, this song also brings up some issues with his ongoing feud with Ja Rule who made some remarks about Hailie, Marshall's daughter, on a song called \"Loose Change\". Ja Rule called Eminem's wife 'a known slut' and his mother a crackhead in the song and wondered what Eminem's 12 year old daughter Hailie was going to be \"when she grows up\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Eminem/_/Like+Toy+Soldiers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He is also a member of the hip-hop supergroup Black Hippy collective along with members Jay Rock, Ab-Soul and Schoolboy Q. His music is largely influenced by the works of 2Pac, Jay-Z, Nas, DMX, The Notorious B.I.G., Mos Def, Eazy-E and Eminem.\n\nHe began to gain major recognition in 2010 after his first retail release, Overly Dedicated. The following year, Lamar independently released his first studio album Section.80, which included his debut single, \"HiiiPoWeR\". By that time, he had amassed a large Internet following and collaborated with several artists in the hip hop industry, including The Game, Snoop Dogg, Busta Rhymes, Lil Wayne and Drake.\n\nLamar secured a major-label record deal with Aftermath and Interscope Records, in 2012. His major-label debut, good kid, m.A.A.d city, was released in October 2012 to critical success. The record contained the top 40 singles \"Swimming Pools (Drank)\", \"Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe\", and \"Poetic Justice\". It debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Lamar won his first Grammy Award for \"i\", lead single from his critical acclaimed third album To Pimp a Butterfly (2015). The album drew on free jazz, funk, soul, and spoken word, debuted atop the charts in the U.S. and the UK, and won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 58th ceremony. In 2016, Lamar released untitled unmastered., a collection of unreleased demos that originated during the recording sessions for Butterfly.\n\nLamar has received a number of accolades over the course of his career, including seven Grammy Awards. In early 2013, MTV named Lamar the number one \"Hottest MC in the Game\", on their annual list. Time named Lamar one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2016.\n\nLamar's fourth album, DAMN. was released April 17, 2017 to widespread critical acclaim. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, earning Lamar his third consecutive number one album in the United States. The album was supported by the lead single, \"Humble.\". \n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Read Guy's memories..."}, "description": "\"Clocks\" emerged in conception during the late stages into the production of Coldplay's second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head. The band's vocalist, Chris Martin, came in studio late one night. A riff popped  up in Martin's mind and wrote it on the  piano. Martin presented the riff to the band's guitarist, Jonny Buckland, who then added guitar chords on the basic track.\n\nDuring the writing of \"Clocks\", the band had already made 10 songs for the album. With this, they thought it was too late for the song's inclusion in the album. So, they recorded a demo version of the track and saved it with other unfinished tracks, labeling it \"Songs for #3\"; the band considered these tracks for their third album, X&Y.\n\nAlthough the band left \"Clocks\" unfinished, a friend of Martin heard of it and convinced him to finish the track. Marked by its lyrics which speak of urgency, Martin's friend pointed out that its meaning would contradict Martin's idea of stashing the track.\n\nPersuaded by his friend, Martin assumed on further developing the track. Other band members supplemented their ideas on the main piano track; they added a bass figure and drums. The last song included in the album, Coldplay recorded the song very fast. By the time Martin recorded his vocals, a few people inside the studio felt the song \"is something special\". According to Martin, \"Clocks\" was inspired by the English rock band Muse.\n__________________________________________\nMUSIC\n__________________________________________\n\"Clocks\" is a piano rock song. Its musicscape is built around a repeating piano riff, and features a minimalist soundscape of drums and bass. It also includes synthesizers and a sparse string arrangement.\n\nThe song's lyrical themes include contrast, contradictions and urgency. Chris Martin sings of being in the state of \"helplessness ... in a dysfunctional relationship he doesn't necessarily want to escape\". The lyrics are cryptic; the ending lines of the second verse emphasize contradiction of emotion: \"Come out upon my seas/Cursed missed opportunities/Am I a part of the cure/Or am I part of the disease?\".The song's title also \"metaphorically alludes\" to its lyrics, \"pushing one to wonder about the world\u2019s obsession with time while connecting it to the theory: make the best of it when we\u2019re here, present and alive\".\n\nThis won the Grammy for 2003 Record Of The Year. In accepting the award, lead singer Chris Martin dedicated it to the late Johnny Cash and to US presidential candidate John Kerry, \"Who hopefully will be your president someday.\"\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/Clocks\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

One night, during a stay in Liverpool, Martin found an old piano that was out of tune. He wanted to work on George Harrison's song \"Isn't It a Pity\", but he could not manage to do so. When the song came to Martin, he asked that the recorder be turned on. He concludes with saying that he came across this chord sequence and noted that the chord was \"lovely\". Martin recorded the vocals and piano takes in a studio in Liverpool.\n\nWhen asked about the development of the song, during a track-by-track reveal, Martin said: \"That's just about girls.

The band wrote the song and co-produced it with British record producer Ken Nelson for their debut album, Parachutes. The song's lyrics are a reference to band vocalist Chris Martin's unrequited love, and its musicscape is built on a varied instrumentation.\n\nThe song was released in June 2000 as the second single off the album, following \"Shiver\", and the lead single in the United States. The single reached number four in the UK Singles Chart, giving the band their first top-five hit in the United Kingdom.\n\nHelped by heavy rotation and usage in promotions, the song thrust the band into massive popularity. \"Yellow\" has since been covered by various recording artists worldwide, and remains one of the band's most popular songs.\n\nWhile composing the song's lyrics, however, Chris Martin could not find the right words. He was thinking of a specific word, which he deemed a missing key word in the lyrics, to fit the song's concept. He looked around the studio and found the telephone directory Yellow Pages, which happened to be situated nearest to him. Chris Martin later titled the song \"Yellow\" as a reference to the directory. But according to him, \"In an alternate universe, this song could be called 'Playboy.'\" The lyrics progressed from there with the band collaborating. The band's bassist Guy Berryman came up with the opening line \"Look at the stars\". That night, having quickly composed the song, the band recorded it.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/Yellow\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Originally titled \"Panic\", the earliest known prototype of the song existed in 1998, performed live during the band's first gig in the same year. It had a different melody, and was included in the band's second EP, The Blue Room. The track was reproduced by Coldplay and British producer Ken Nelson for the band's debut studio album, Parachutes.\n\nFollowing their successful releases in 2000, Coldplay and their record label Parlophone thought there was enough exposure of the album in the United Kingdom. Thus, the decision of releasing a fourth single would be for regions that had not been overdosed by the hit singles \"Yellow\" and \"Trouble\". They settled on \"Don't Panic\", which at the time was an audience favorite. The single was released in some European regions, and the United Kingdom only received a promo edition. The critical reception of the song was generally positive. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/Don%27t+Panic\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It reached number 10 on the UK Singles Chart, making it the band's second Top 10 single in the country. Although Trouble failed to chart on the main singles chart in the United States, the music press deemed it almost as successful as its predecessor, Yellow . Two different music videos for the song were released.\n\nAccording to Coldplay vocalist Chris Martin, he wrote Trouble as a result of his own behavior. He recalls, \"There were some bad things going in our band ... the song is about behaving badly towards somebody you really love and I was certainly doing that to some members of the band.\" He added that he supposed it was about time to act of a knobhead. The four members of Coldplay co-wrote \"trouble \".\n\nLike the song \"Yellow\", which repeats the word yellow, Martin wrote \"Trouble\" with the repetitive use of the word trouble. The song's lyrics are on \"softer emotional themes\"; including apologies, unrequited love, and longing. The song's musicscape was said to be minimalist. Trouble is built around a piano, with a snare drum background that was mixed very low. The snare drum section tends to be inaudible when the guitars come in. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/Trouble\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Built around a piano riff, the song builds into a huge, synthesizer-heavy chorus. It was released on 23 May 2005 by Parlophone Records as the lead single from the album.\n\nColdplay vocalist Chris Martin admitted that the song was developed after the band had listened to English alternative rock singer Kate Bush. The song's drumbeat is similar to Bush's 1985 song \"Running Up That Hill\". Upon the song's release, it charted in the UK Singles Chart in the number two position. In the United States, it reached number eight on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nAlthough it was recognized Song of the Year by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), the song received only mixed reviews from critics. \"Speed of Sound\" was nominated twice at the 48th Grammy Awards. The song won a Brit Award in the category for Best British Single in 2006. The track's music video was nominated for four MTV Video Music Awards. \"Speed of Sound\" was also the billionth song downloaded from the iTunes Store. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/Speed+of+Sound\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band comprises vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, lead guitarist Jonny Buckland \u2013 who met each other in September 1996 at Ramsay Hall (halls of residence) at University College London - bassist Guy Berryman and drummer Will Champion.\n\nNot only have Coldplay had 7 highly successful studio album releases (all of which reached #1 on the UK album chart) - with their latest 7th studio album released on December 4, 2015 (A Head Full of Dreams) - Coldplay have also achieved great success with their singles, such as Yellow, Speed of Sound, the Grammy-winning Clocks and the US and UK #1 single Viva La Vida.\n\n\nInfluences\nColdplay's early material was often compared to that of Jeff Buckley and Radiohead, while also drawing comparisons to U2 and Travis. Since the release of the band's debut album, Parachutes (2000), Coldplay has also drawn influence from other sources, including Echo and the Bunnymen and George Harrison on A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002) and Johnny Cash and Kraftwerk for X&Y (2005).\n\nFrontman Chris Martin credits 1980s Norwegian pop band a-ha for inspiring him to form his own band.\n\nColdplay never intended to become England's favorite rock & roll sons when their signature rock melodies ruled the charts throughout 2000. The quartet yearned to mess around a bit, plucking their own acoustics for fun while attending the University College of London. All had been playing instruments since their early teens and had been influenced by the likes of Bob Dylan, the Stone Roses, Neil Young, and My Bloody Valentine.\n\nThey never imagined taking reign of the UK's ever-changing rock scene. Each member had come from a solid household of middle-class parents who encouraged music. Chris Martin, the eldest of five siblings, began playing the piano as a young child. He started playing in bands around age 15 and sought solace in the words of Tom Waits. Jonny Buckland, on the other hand, was into the heavy guitar work of Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix and was playing guitar by age 11. Scotland native Guy Berryman was into funk instead of indie rock, therefore leaving him to play bass. The multi-instrumentalist Champion had not planned to be a drummer until he joined Coldplay. He favored playing guitar, bass, and the tin whistle, but caught on to playing percussion when the band became official.\n\nWhen they burst onto the scene, Coldplay were heart-wrenching like Travis, passionate like Jeff Buckley, and as fresh as Oasis. They played their first gig at a festival for unsigned bands in Manchester, and the Safety EP was issued shortly thereafter. The Brothers & Sisters EP was issued by Fierce Panda and released a year later. (Both releases saw only 500 pressings.) Their sweet melodies and swooning lyrics landed Coldplay a UK deal with Parlophone in April 1999, and the five-track limited edition Blue Room EP followed that autumn. With nods from the media, the dream pop foursome was hailed as the next Travis, thanks to their simplistic acoustics and charming personas. Two more EPs, Shiver and Yellow, arrived in Spring 2000.\n\nAlbums\nThe band has released 5 albums with the latest sixth album scheduled for release in May 2014: Parachutes (2000), A Rush Of Blood To The Head (2002), X&Y (2005), Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), Mylo Xyoto (2011) and in May 2014, Ghost Stories (2014).\n\nParachutes (2000)\nTheir full-length debut album, Parachutes, earned the band a Mercury Music Prize nomination in the UK. It saw a US release in November 2000, and a month later Yellow,  was chosen as the theme song for all promo spots for the American TV network ABC. The well-received hype surrounding Coldplay continued throughout 2001 as well; they were nominated for three Brit Awards and embarked on a sold-out ten-date tour of the US. Rumors of a split consumed most of the US tour. Martin frequently battled nasty colds and voice exhaustion, which led Coldplay to cancel a series of American dates and scrap a European tour. With all gossip aside, Coldplay resumed playing in Summer 2001 and earned additional success with second single Trouble.\n\nA Rush of Blood to the Head (2002)\nBy the autumn, they had headed into the studio for a second album. Rumour had it that it might be Coldplay's last album, since the band members felt they might not capture such brilliance again. A Rush Of Blood To The Head was released in August 2002. The CD/DVD package Live 2003 was issued a year later. Capturing the band's show at the Horden Pavilion in Sydney, Australia, it highlighted Coldplay's monumental success worldwide with A Rush Of Blood To The Head. Martin specifically earned a higher notch on the celebrity scale by marrying actress Gwyneth Paltrow in December 2003. Paltrow gave birth to the couple's first daughter, Apple Blythe Alison Martin, the following April.\n\nX&Y (2005)\nFatherhood did not stop Martin from working, as Coldplay began recording material for a third album within weeks. Previously recorded material with long-time producer Ken Nelson was scrapped early on, while producer Danton Supple (Morrissey, The Cure) joined Coldplay to complete the recording of X&Y. Speed Of Sound marked Coldplay's first single from their long-awaited third effort in Spring 2005; the album followed in June, topping the charts around the world, including America and Britain.\n\nViva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008)\nColdplay's fourth album Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends was released on June 12, 2008 in the United Kingdom, with the first single Violet Hill having been previously released as a free download through their official website for a week from April 29, 2008. Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends was produced by Brian Eno, mixed by Markus Dravs, and drew influence from the time the group spent in South America. \nThe album received lots of positive feedback for its originality in melodic acoustics and slightly less 'synth-dependent' riffs. It offered a great insight into how significantly the band's music had adapted and developed to themselves and the public.\n\nCharity duet (single) for World AIDS Day (2008)\nBarely a week before the album Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends was released, a duet with Kylie Minogue, which was intended to be used on the album, was scrapped with the comment that 'it\u2019s just too sexy [\u2026] also we haven\u2019t quite finished it'. The track, Lhuna was subsequently released as a charity single to promote World AIDS Day 2008 on December 1, 2008.\n\nMylo Xyloto (2011)\nColdplay's fifth album, Mylo Xyloto, was released on October 24, 2011, with the first two tracks from the album - Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall and Paradise - were released on June 3, 2011 and September 12, 2012 respectively. The album was no.1 in over 34 countries, and has sold over 8m copies worldwide.\n\nGhost Stories (2014)\nThe band's sixth album, Ghost Stories, was officially released on May 19, 2014. Prior to the release, Coldplay made the full album available to stream via iTunes, with an animation of the album artwork designed by Mila F\u00fcrstov\u00e1, one week ahead of the official release date. The first track from the album, Midnight was released on February 25, 2014. The album was recorded at The Bakery and The Beehive studios in London, England. Ghost Stories entered the Billboard 200 as Number 1 and marked Coldplay's fourth straight number 1 studio album, selling 383,000 copies in the US in the week ending May 25, 2014 - of which 64% came from digital downloads according to Billboard.\n\nA Head Full of Dreams (2015)\nThe band's 7th studio album, A Head Full of Dreams, was released December 4, 2015 on the Parlophone label. The 11-track album (with an additional hidden track called \u201cX Marks The Spot\u201d) was recorded in LA and London, and was produced by Stargate and Rik Simpson. A world tour is promised to accompany the album in 2016.\n\nSuper Bowl - February 2016\nColdplay headlined at the much coverted Super Bowl 50 half-time show on February 7, 2016. The band performed a remixed version of their hit single \"Yellow\", before playing \"Vida La Vida\", \"Paradise\" and their 2015 single \"Adventure Of A Lifetime\". Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson then took to the stage to perform their hit \"Uptown Funk\", before Beyonc\u00e9 emerged on stage with her latest single \"Formation\".\n\n2016 - First US tour since 2012\nColdplay announced its Head Full of Dreams tour on January 28, 2016 - the first in the USA since 2012. The first concert will be held at MetLife Stadium (New York) on July 16, 2016.\n\nCommercial endorsements\nColdplay are one of very few current British music acts to achieve major success in North America. Despite their large worldwide popularity, the band has remained protective of how their music is used in the media, refusing its use for product endorsements. In the past, Coldplay had turned down multi-million dollar contracts from Gatorade, Diet Coke, and Gap, who wanted to use the songs Yellow, Trouble, and Don't Panic respectively. According to Martin, \"We wouldn't be able to live with ourselves if we sold the songs' meanings like that.\"  On the other hand, Yellow has been used to back TV trailers for \"The Simpsons\" and Viva La Vida featured on an iTunes TV advert.\n\nPolitical and social activism\nSince 2002, Coldplay have been active supporters of various social and political causes. They have been visible advocates of Oxfam's Make Trade Fair campaign and Amnesty International. The group has also performed at various charity projects such as Band Aid 20, Live 8, and the Teenage Cancer Trust.\n\n\nOfficial website: www.coldplay.com\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Queen - 'Bohemian Rhapsody' Click here to buy the DVD with this video at..."}, "description": "\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is a song written by Freddie Mercury and originally recorded by the band Queen for their 1975 album A Night at the Opera.\n\nThe song is in the style of a stream-of-consciousness nightmare, and has unusual musical structure for popular music (it has no chorus, instead consisting of seemingly disjointed sections including operatic segments, an a cappella and a hard rock part) which works beyond the range of this reviewer. Despite this, it was released as a single and became a huge commercial success. \n\nBohemian Rhapsody is widely hailed as Queen's \"magnum opus\", and it marked a decisive point in the band's career and set them on the way to become one of the world's most popular music groups.  The single was accompanied by a groundbreaking music video (then termed a \"promotional video\") which helped establish the visual language of the modern music video. \n\nA truncated version of the song was included in all Queen's subsequent live concert performances (as the band could not recreate the middle section live, because of the many overdubbed voices) and still enjoys great popularity around the world.\n\nIn January 1976,  Freddie Mercury was interviewed by Sounds regarding the writing process of the song.:\n\n\"I'm going to shatter some illusions, it was just one of those pieces I wrote for the album: just writing my batch of songs. In its early stages I almost rejected it, but then it grew. We started deciding on a single about halfway through. There were a few contenders - we were thinking of 'The Prophet's Song' at one point - but then 'Bohemian Rhapsody' seemed the one. There was a time when the others wanted to chop it around a bit, but I refused. If it was going to be released, it would be in its entirety. We knew it was very risky, but we had so much confidence in that song - I did anyway. I felt, underneath it all, that if it was successful it would earn a lot of respect. People were all going, You're joking, they'll never play it, you'll only hear the first few bars and then they'll fade it out. We had numerous rows. EMI were shocked - A six-minute single? You must be joking! The same in America - Oh, you just got away with it in Britain.\"\n\nIn a 1982 interview with  On The Record, Queen guitarist Brian May discussed the song's vocal harmonies, and creating the now famous solo.\n\nInterviewer: Who came up with the idea for the vocal harmonies used in \"Bohemian Rhapsody\"?\n\nBrian May:  We always were keen on that kind of thing. That was something which we wanted to do from the beginning. We wanted to be a group that could do the heaviness of hard rock, but also have harmonies swooping around all over the place. We thought there was some real power and emotion in that combination.\n\nInterviewer: Was the first solo in that song very difficult for you?\n\nBrian May: No, that was pretty much off the cuff, except I think I had plenty of time to think about that one. I remember playing along with it in the studio for a while when other things were being done. I knew what kind of melody I wanted to play. \n\nJohn Deacon spoke about the song in a 1977 interview: \"When we finished the album, the Night at the Opera album, that was the track on it that we thought we were gonna release as a single in England first. And when we released it in England we didn't necessarily think it'd be released in America, cause we know even over here, you know, the AM tastes are even more (hesitates) stricter. Anyway we did have thoughts about even in England, perhaps editing it down at all, but we listened to it over and over again and there was no way we could edit it. We tried a few ideas, but if you edited it, you always lost some part of the song, so we had to leave it all in.

On the studio version, Brian May's only guitar playing is in his guitar solo, but on live versions performed on the band's 1978 and 1979 tours, May would also play rhythm guitar throughout the rest of the song to add a rockier feeling to it.\n\n The song also provides an example of Queen's trademark style of multi-track harmony vocals for the chorus lines. Several recordings were laid over each other to achieve the final sound.\n\nThe lyrics have cosmic imagery describing feelings of power and exhilaration, for example \"I'm gonna go, go, go there's no stopping me / I'm burning through the sky yeah 200 degrees\u2026\".\n\nThe single reached #9 in the UK charts but only #86 in the US. \n\nDespite the fact that the studio version is one of Queen's most popular songs, it only lasted from 1978-1979 live, with the last performance in the Crazy Tour. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Don%27t+Stop+Me+Now\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

All 4 members of Queen wrote songs, and each wrote at least one hit. Deacon also wrote \"You\u2019re My Best Friend\u201d\n\nQueen recorded a live version of Another One Bites The Dust which can be heard at Another One Bites The Dust (live)\n\nDeacon was influenced by the Chic song Good Times. In an interview with the New Musical Express, Chic bass player Bernard Edwards said: \u201cWell, that Queen record came about because that bass player spent some time hanging out with us at our studio. But that\u2019s OK. What isn\u2019t OK is that the press started saying that we had ripped them off! Can you believe that? \u2018Good Times\u2019 came out more than a year before, but it was inconceivable to these people that black musicians could possibly be innovative like that. It was just these dumb Disco guys ripping off this Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll song.\u201d\n\nDeacon played most of the instruments on the track: lead and rhythm guitars, bass, reversed piano and additional percussion. Brian May did some guitar effects with harmoniser (in the interlude), and Roger Taylor played the drum loop. Surprisingly, there are no synthesizers, despite the band's decision to use synthesizers for the first time on the album.\n\n The drum track and the hand claps were looped. They repeat throughout the song.\n\nWhile the band and producer Reinhold Mack were mixing the track, Brian May\u2019s roadie suggested it to be released as single; the band didn\u2019t like the idea but were finally talked into doing it when Michael Jackson, after a concert, suggested the same idea.\n\nDeacon claimed in a 1980 interview that Roger Taylor opposed the song\u2019s drum beat. However the drummer denied this in an interview with Mojo magazine October 2008. He insisted: \u201cI\u2019d already had an ineffectual pop at that kind of music with \u2018Fun It,\u2019 on the Jazz album. I was never against Another One Bites The Dust, but I was against releasing it as a single.\u201d\n\nFreddie Mercury loved this track. Brian May recalled to Mojo: \u201cFreddie sung until his throat bled on Another One Bites The Dust. He was so into it.

Queen - 'We Will Rock You' Click here to buy the DVD with this video at the..."}, "description": "\"We Will Rock You\" is a song written by Brian May and recorded and performed by Queen as the opening track on their 1977 album News of the World. The album version consists of a stamping-clapping beat, and a power chorus, being somewhat of an anthem. The stamping effects were created by the band overdubbing the sounds of themselves stomping and clapping many times and adding delay effects to create a sound like many people were participating. According to the We Will Rock You Songfacts, Brian May said that his degree in astrophysics helped in the recording of the crucial 'stomp-stomp-clap!\" rhythm of the song. Other than the last 30 seconds containing a guitar solo, the song is generally set in acapella form, using  clapping as a rhythmic beat.\n\nAs the double A-side with \"We Are The Champions\", \"We Will Rock You\" reached number 4 on the U.S. Billboard singles chart, becoming their second hit in the U.S. On the 45 of the song's original vinyl record release, the song was actually the flip side of \"We Are the Champions\" in Britain, however the American record company requested to put the two songs together as a \"double A-side\" because American radio stations were playing them back to back. This is a reason why the songs are often paired on the radio and at sporting events, where they are frequently played. The songs are also paired back to back on the album, and they are still played together to this day on American classic rock radio stations.\n\nQueen also performed the song in another arrangement (known as the \"fast version\"), which featured a faster tempo and a full guitar, bass and drums backing track throughout. The band would often open their live sets in the late 1970s and early 1980s with this version, as captured on their 1979 Live Killers double album, on Queen Rock Montreal (2007), and on the Queen on Fire - Live at the Bowl album released in 2004.\nThe \"stomp, stomp, clap\" sounds were later reused in the Queen + Paul Rodgers song \"Still Burnin'\", a composition which was also written by May.\n\n\"We Will Rock You,\" as recalled by May in a 2002 interview with Guitar World magazine, \"was a response to a particular phase in Queen's career, when the audience was becoming a bigger part of the show than we were. They would sing all the songs. And in a place like Birmingham, they'd be so vociferous that we'd have to stop the show and let them sing to us. So, both Freddie and I thought it would be an interesting experiment to write a song with audience participation specifically in mind. My feeling was that everyone can stamp and clap and sing a simple motif, so We Will Rock You was based on that. \n\n\"We recorded it at [Basing Street] Wessex, which is an old converted church that has a natural good sound to it. There are no drums on the track. It's just us clapping and stamping on boards, overdubbed many times over with many primitive delay machines. A bit of singing, a bit of guitar playing, and that's it. The amazing thing is to go to football [soccer] matches or sports events in general and hear people do it. It's very gratifying to find that it has become part of folklore, sort of. I'll die happy because of that.\" \n\nIn a recent interview with Terry Gross (host of \"Fresh Air\"), conducted on August 3rd 2010, May was asked to elaborate on writing the song.\n\nTerry Gross: \" So what inspired that song? I mean, it's been played at so many sports stadiums over the decades. What were you thinking about when you wrote it? Were you thinking of it as a sports anthem?\"\n\nBrian May: No, not really. I was thinking of it more as a rock anthem, I suppose, and a means of uniting an audience or taking advantage, you know, enjoying the fact that an audience is united. And I didn't realize that it would transfer to sports games and this is quite an amazing thing. It's wonderful for me to see what \"We Will Rock You\" has done. You know, \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions,\" of course, have kind of transcended the normal framework of where music is listened to and appreciated. They've become part of public life, which I feel wonderful about. It's fantastic to me if I go to a, you know, a football game or a soccer game or basketball or whatever or any place all around the world, and there it is. And I think, \"My God. Most people don't even realize that I wrote it. Most people don't realize that it was written\". \"\n\nGross: That's right.\n\nMay:: It's sort of become \u2026\n\nGross:: (laughs)  That\u2019s right.\n\nMay: \u2026one of those things that people think was always there. You know, it sort of goes back into pre-history. So in a way, that's the best compliment you could have for a song.\n\nGross:: Well, I think, you know, that's if people don't even realize it was written, it's in part because it almost sounds like an old-school cheerleader cheer, you know, because...\n\nMay: Yeah. It's become part of the fabric of life.\n\nGross:: ... of that stomp-stomp-clap thing and because it's a chant.\n\nMay: Yeah, that's right. Well, the stomp-stomp-clap thing, yeah, people think it was always there, but actually it wasn't. And I don't know how it got into my head. All I can tell you is we played a gig sort of the middle of our career in a place called Bingley Hall near Birmingham. Now, Birmingham is the sort of home of heavy metal, as you probably know. You know, Sabbath and Slade and people come from there. And it was a great night. People were just, the audience were just responding hugely, and they were singing along with everything we did. Now, in the beginning, we didn't relate to that. We were the kind of band who liked to be listened to and taken seriously and all that stuff, you know. So people singing along wasn't part of our agenda. Having said that and then having experienced this wave of participation of the audience, particularly in that gig in Birmingham, we almost to a man sort of reassessed our situation.\n\nI remember talking to Freddie about it and saying, \u201cLook, you know, obviously, we can no longer fight this. This has to become something which is part of our show, and we have to embrace it, the fact that people want to participate. And really, everything becomes a two-way process now.\u201d And we sort of looked at each other and went, \u201cHmm, how interesting\u201d. And he went away that night and to the best of my knowledge wrote \"We Are the Champions\" with that in mind. I went away and woke up the next morning with this... (Vocalises 'stomp-stomp-clap') ... in my mind somehow because I was thinking to myself, \"What could you give an audience that they could do while they're standing there and they're all crushed together? They can stamp, and they can clap, and they can sing some kind of chant.\" So for some reason, it just came straight into my head, the \"We Will Rock You.\"\n\nAnd to me, it was kind of a uniting thing. It was an expression of strength. And the words came out very quickly. In fact, everything came out very quickly, and I think that's a good sign when you're writing a song. It should happen quickly, very often, and that means the flow is a good one. And the words are something completely different. If you ask me what I was thinking of in the words of the verses, it's something different. It's although it's related.\n\nGross:: About the boy who's told he's no good?\n\nMay: Yeah, it's about the development of a boy into a man and his dreams and how he sees himself and how he views his power in the world. It's a kind, it's sort of a contemplative song, really, although it's a big chant with fist in the air. It's about balancing your power with acceptance, I think.\n\nGross: So how did you record the stomp-stomp-clap so it would sound grand and reverberating, as opposed to three people, four people stomping their feet and clapping?\n\nMay: Well, I'm a physicist, you see. (LAUGHING) So I had this idea, if we did it enough times, and we didn't use any reverb or anything, that I could build a sound which would work.\n\nWe were very lucky. We were working in an old, disused church in North London, and it already had a nice sound, not an echoey sound but a nice, big, crisp sound to it. And there were some old boards lying around. I don't know what they were, but they just seemed ideal to stamp on. So we kind of piled them up and started stamping. And they sounded great anyway.\n\nBut being a physicist, I thought,\"Well, supposing there were a thousand people doing this, what would be happening?\" And I thought, \"Well, you would be hearing them stamping. You would also be hearing a little bit of an effect, which is due to the distance that they are from you.\" So I put lots of individual repeats on them, not an echo but a single repeat and at varying distances. And the distances were all prime numbers.\n\nNow, much later on, people designed a machine to do this, and I think it was called Prime Time or something, but that's what we did. As we recorded each track, we put a delay of a certain length on it, and none of the delays were sort of harmonically related. So what you get is there's no echo on it whatsoever, but the claps sound as though they're spread around the stereo, but they're also kind of spread as regards distance from you. So you just feel like you're in the middle of a large number of people stamping on boards and clapping \u2026\n\nGross: That's amazing.\n\nMay: \u2026 and also singing.\n\nTS: Now, here's another really interesting thing to me about \"We Will Rock You.\" It's the most famous song that you've written. It's a largely a cappella song. You come in for your guitar solo at the very end. So until, like, the very, very end, like you're not even playing on it, and it's just kind of amazing that you as the guitarist would write a song that you're barely featured on.\n\nMay: Well, I'm featured stamping and clapping.\n\nGross:  Well, yes.\n\nMay: And I'm featured singing, so...\n\nGross: And you're very good at that.\n\n(LAUGHING)\n\nMay:: Thank you, yeah. Well, we're all featured, yeah. Yeah, well, you see, songs aren't about guitars to me. Songs are about, truthfully, a song is about a singer in my opinion, and if the singer gets the idea across, then you're almost home and dry.\n\nYou know, you can make the most beautiful piece of production, and I love production. You know, production is a big part of my life. But I'm always aware that if you don't have the right singer, and he doesn't have the right feeling, that you're wasting your time. So a song is a song to me, and it doesn't matter what song. It could be a piano accordion on it. You know, if it's the right song and the right singer, and you feel passion, that's what it's about.\n\nThe guitars, yeah, I didn't want us to be standard. I didn't want it to be like oh, here's a guitar solo, and then we sing another verse. I wanted it to be something stark and different. So it was very deliberate that I left the guitar solo to the end just because that was a final statement and a different statement, taking it off in a completely different direction. It changes key into that piece, too, you know, so it's a whole different kind of ship? (unintelligible) It was not a standard pop song. \n\n(From here, the host played the remainder of the song)\n\nGross: So that's the end of \"We Will Rock You,\" written by my guest, guitarist and singer and songwriter, Brian May, who was one of the founding members of Queen. So ...\n\nMay: I should, can I comment on the end of that?\n\nGross: Yeah, please.\n\n(LAUGHING)\n\nMay: Interesting that you play the end of the song. You can hear the guitar waiting in the wings. That was, you can hear this little feedback note. And so the guitar is present, although it's not taking center stage, all through the last choruses, and then finally, it bursts upon the scene. And you notice, Freddie goes \u201cAll right\u201d, which means he's kind of handing over to the guitar, and we're in a different universe once the guitar starts, and that was the intention. And it's very sort of informal.\n\nAnd you may notice - there's a lot of things to notice. You may notice that the last piece, the very last little riffs, are repeated, and they're not just repeated by me playing them again. They're repeated by cutting the tape and splicing it on again and again. So, and that's deliberate, too. It's a way of getting a sort of a thing that makes you sit up towards the end. And then it stops. There is nothing after it, which I really enjoy. (laughs)\n\nThere's no big ending. It just stops and leaves you in mid-air, thinking, \u201cWell, what happened there?\u201d  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/We+Will+Rock+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

One of their most famous and popular songs, it has since become an anthem for sporting victories and has been often used or referenced in popular culture (see below). The song reached #2 in the UK charts and #4 on the Hot 100 in the US in 1978.\n\nMusically, it is based around Mercury's piano part, with Roger Taylor and John Deacon providing a drums and bass guitar backing. Brian May overdubbed some guitar sections, initially subtle, but building to a 'solo' played simultaneously with the last chorus. Mercury employed many jazz chords (major and minor 6th, 7th, 9th, 11th and 13th harmonies), and the choruses featured these voiced as 4 and 5-part vocal harmonies. The lead vocal is very demanding and strident, and in live performances, Mercury often deferred to let Taylor handle the highest parts of the melody.\n\nThe single featured \"We Will Rock You\" as a B-side in the UK and as a double A side in the US and other countries, and preceded the song on the album. The two songs were often played consecutively at the close of Queen concerts, and are customarily played together on radio broadcasts (in album order). Keeping with tradition, it was also used to close the 1992 Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert with all the show's acts joining in behind the lead vocal of Liza Minnelli. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/We+Are+the+Champions\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Queen - 'Killer Queen' Click here to buy the DVD with this video at the Official..."}, "description": "\"Killer Queen\",  is a song by the British rock band Queen and was written by lead singer Freddie Mercury. It was their breakthrough hit, reaching #2 in the UK and #11 in the United States in early 1975. The song was taken from Queen's 1974 album Sheer Heart Attack, and was released as a Double A-side, along with \"Flick of the Wrist\".\n\nMercury commented that the influences he received for the track included early Beatles records, Beach Boys and (lyrically) Noel Coward. He wrote the lyrics first before adding the complex musical arrangements. The recording features elaborate 4-part vocal harmonies (particularly in the choruses, and also providing backing parts in the verses), and also an elaborate multi-tracked guitar solo by Brian May. \n\nMercury was quite fond of the song, and spoke of it during a 1974 interview with Melody Maker.\n\n\n\"Well, 'Killer Queen' I wrote in one night. I'm not being conceited or anything, but it just fell into place. Certain songs do. Now, March Of The Black Queen, that took ages. I had to give it everything, to be self indulgent or whatever. But with 'Killer Queen', I scribbled down the words in the dark one Saturday night and the next morning I got them all together and I worked all day Sunday and that was it. I'd got it. It gelled. It was great. Certain things just come together, but other things you have to work for. The whole band is very particular. We don't go in for half measures and I'm very hard with myself. There're no compromises. If I thought a song wasn't quite right, I'd discard it. I'm very intricate and delicate. You can see that in my paintings. I love painters like Richard Dadd, Mucha and Dali, and I love Arthur Rackham.\"\n\nHe spoke further of the song in a 1976 interview with Record Mirror.\n\n\"We're very proud of that number. It's done me a lot of proud. It's just one of the tracks I wrote for the album to be honest. It wasn't written as a single. I just wrote a batch of songs for the Sheer Heart Attack album and when I finished writing it, and when we recorded it, we found it was a very, very strong single. It really was.

It topped the charts in Australia for six weeks.\n\nThe song is written in a rockabilly style. As reported by Mercury in Melody Maker, May 2, 1981, Mercury composed \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" on the guitar in just five to ten minutes. Other accounts say that he wrote it while lounging in a bubble bath in the Bayerischer Hof Hotel in Munich during one of Queen's extensive Munich recording sessions. He took it to the studio shortly after writing it and presented it to bandmates Roger Taylor and John Deacon. The three of them, with their new producer Mack, recorded it at Musicland Studios in Munich. The entire song was reportedly recorded in less than half an hour (although Mack says it was six hours)\n\nFreddie Mercury - May 1981,  Melody Maker:\n\n'Crazy Little Thing Called Love' took me five or ten minutes. I did that on the guitar, which I can't play for nuts, and in one way it was quite a good thing because I was restricted, knowing only a few chords. It's a good discipline because I simply had to write within a small framework. I couldn't work through too many chords and because of that restriction I wrote a good song, I think.\n\nBrian May, 1982 On The Record:\n\nInterviewer: Did you use a Fender on \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\"?\n\nYes. I used on of Roger's really old, beat up, natural wood Telecaster. I got bludgeoned into playing it. That was Mack's idea. I said \"I don't want to play a Telecaster. It basically doesn't suit my style\". But \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" was such a period piece, it seemed to need that period sound. So I said, \"Okay, Mack, if you want to set it up, I'll play it\". He put it through a Mesa/Boggie, which is an amplifier I don't get on well with at all; it just doesn't suit me. I tried it, and it sounded okay.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Crazy+Little+Thing+Called+Love\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Written by singer Freddie Mercury, the track featured on their 1976 album A Day at the Races, from which it was also released as the lead single.\n\nLike \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", the major hit from Queen's previous album A Night At The Opera, \"Somebody to Love\" has a complex melody and deep layering of vocal tracks, this time based on a gospel choir arrangement. It was the first single off the album A Day at the Races. It is a rock ballad on which band members Freddie Mercury, Brian May and Roger Taylor multitracked their voices to create the impression of a 100-voice gospel choir.\n\n The lyrics, especially combined with the gospel influence, create a song about faith, desperation and soul-searching; the singer questions both the lack of love he's experiencing and the role of God in helping to provide this disparately needed in his life. He's passionately pondering what the use of it all is without having somebody to love in his life. Staying true to Queen's guitar-driven style, it was also filled with intricate harmonies and a notable guitar solo by Brian May, and it went to number 2 on the UK charts and number 13 on the U.S. singles chart.\n\nA promotional video was made combining a staged recording session at Sarm East Studios (where the A Day at the Races album was recorded) and film footage of the band's performance at Hyde Park that September.\n\nThe song was included on their first Greatest Hits, released in 1981.\n\nAt the 1992 Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert held at Wembley Stadium, the song was performed by George Michael, and this was later rereleased in 1993 as the lead track of an EP called Five Live which went to #1 in the UK. This version is also available on Greatest Hits III, released in 1999.\n\nRoger Taylor  spoke briefly on the song during a  31/01/1977 interview with Circus Magazine.\n\n Taylor:  \"'Somebody To Love' is Aretha Franklin-influenced. Freddie's very much into that. We tried to keep the track in a loose, gospel-type feel. I think it's the loosest track we've ever done.\"\n\nThis was also one of few tracks where John Deacon sang backing vocals when performed live. His voice was clearly heard on bootlegs from the band's performance at Earls Court in June, 1977 and at the Houston Summit in December, 1977. From 1977 to 1978, it was played about every show. For the Jazz and Live Killer tours, it was only played sometimes. In The Game Tour, it was only played early in the tour. It was also played for South America Bites The Dust, Live at the Bowl and Queen Rock Montreal. Later in The Works Tour, a shortened version was played as a medley preceding \"Killer Queen\".\n\nWhen performed live, Mercury would often alter the melodies of the song, but would generally hit the sustained A\u266d4 notes throughout the song. The A\u266d4 at the peak of the building line \"can anybody find me\" on the studio version was not part of Mercury's original melody, but the other band members felt that it worked better than his: Mercury reverted to his original melody for this line when live.\n\nAt the 1992 Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert held at Wembley Stadium, the song was performed by George Michael, and this was later rereleased in 1993 as the lead track of an EP called Five Live which went to #1 in the UK. This version is also available on Greatest Hits III, released in 1999.\n\n    * George Michael performed the song with Queen's surviving members at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert in April 1992\n    * G4 sang this on 27 November during The X Factor 2004.\n    * Anne Hathaway sang this song in her role as Ella in the movie Ella Enchanted\n    * Elliott Yamin, who placed third in season five of American Idol, sang this song on Week 8 of live performances\n    * Brittany Murphy sings this song in the movie Happy Feet as her penguin character Gloria.\n    * Ben Mills sang this on 2 December during Barry Manilow and contestant's choice week of The X Factor 2006.\n    * Rhydian Roberts sang it on 1 December during Best of British week of The X Factor 2007.\n    * The cast of Glee covered it in the episode \"The Rhodes Not Taken\" (2009); it hit #26 on the UK Singles Chart.\n    * Joe McElderry sang this on 14 November during Queen week of The X Factor 2009.\n    * In the film Late Last Night, Steven Weber's character sings the song during a drug-infused dreamy scene.\n    * Todrick Hall performed this song on the ninth season of American Idol during the top 16. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Somebody+to+Love\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

According to the I Want To Break Free Songfacts, he wrote it from the male perspective of the women's liberation movement. It featured on their 1984 album The Works. In the UK Chart, it peaked at number 3, and remained in the chart for fifteen consecutive weeks from its release in late April 1984. Most of the song follows the traditional 12 bar blues progression in E Major, a rare thing for a Queen song. The synth solo is played by Fred Mandel \u2013 live, however, May played it on guitar.\n\nTwo differing versions of the song are in circulation. The version on The Works is in fact shorter than the single remix by 61 seconds, because of a fade-in synthesiser introduction and a longer solo in which both the synthesiser and guitar feature separately. This is in contrast to \"Hammer to Fall\", a song which was edited down by thirty seconds from the album version to be released as a single. The promotional 45 sent to radio stations by Capitol Records had both versions on either side. However, Queen's name and the song title were deliberately left off one, so the labels read \"Special Single Mix (Queen 4:21)\" and \"Special Single Mix-Edited (3:59).\n\nThe music video, directed by David Mallet, was a parody of the southern British soap opera Coronation Street. During part of the video, the band members dressed in drag, as mildly similar characters found in the soap at the time; Mercury's character was loosely based on Bet Lynch, while May's character was based on Hilda Ogden. The video also depicted the band in what appeared to be a coal mine in their normal look, and it also features a ballet piece with the Royal Ballet (one of the dancers was Jeremy Sheffield), for which Freddie Mercury shaved his trademark moustache to portray Nijinsky (though he had kept it for the parody part of the video, interestingly enough). According to Brian May in an interview about Queen's Greatest Hits, the video ruined the band in America, where many people - unlike the case in the UK - failed to see the soap-opera connection & interpreted the video as an open declaration of transvestitism and Mercury\u2019s homosexuality. This might explain why singles failed to go above #40 in the US Billboard charts after \"Radio Ga Ga\", until The Show Must Go On reached No. 2. The video was initially banned by MTV in the U.S., but the ban was lifted in 1991 when it aired on VH1's My Generation 2-part episodes devoted to Queen hosted by guitarist Brian May. The song received renewed attention when it was used in a media advertising campaign for Safeway. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/I+Want+to+Break+Free\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was originally included on the A Night at the Opera album in 1975, and later released as a single, with Brian May's '39 as its B-side. The song also appeared on the Greatest Hits (1981) album.\n\nDeacon wrote the song for his wife, Veronica, to whom he remains married to this day. In this song, he plays a Wurlitzer electric piano in addition to bass guitar. The characteristic 'bark' of the Wurlitzer's bass notes plays a prominent role in the song. During live performances, the band used a grand piano rather than an electric, and it would be played by Freddie Mercury, while Deacon played the bass guitar.\n\nFor the music video, it shows the band in a huge ballroom surrounded by over one thousand candles, including a huge chandelier hung above them on the ceiling. The video was filmed in the summer of 1976. (May later mentioned that the video was shot in the middle of a very unpleasant heatwave and the ballroom in which they were filming did not have air conditioning.) Also, Deacon is seen playing a grand piano, even though he plays a regular electric on the recording.\n\nThe band answered Tom Browne on 24 December 1977 in a live BBC Radio One interview, regarding Deacon's control of the piano for the recording.\n\nJohn Deacon: \"Well, Freddie didn\u2019t like the electric piano, so I took it home and I started to learn on the electric piano and basically that\u2019s the song that came out you know when I was learning to play piano. It was written on that instrument and it sounds best on that. You know, often on the instrument that you wrote the song on.\"\n\nFreddie Mercury: I refused to play the damn thing (the Wurlitzer). It\u2019s tiny and horrible and I don\u2019t like them. Why play those things when you\u2019ve got a lovely superb grand piano? No, I think, basically what he [John] is trying to say is it was the desired effect. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/You%27re+My+Best+Friend\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Queen - The Show Must Go On (promo video, 1991) Click here to buy the DVD with this..."}, "description": "\"The Show Must Go On\", written primarily by guitarist Brian May, is a song by English rock band Queen and is featured as the twelfth and final track on their 1991 album Innuendo. As on the previous album, The Miracle, all songs on Innuendo were credited to the band as a whole. \n\nThe initial idea for the song came from a chord sequence  Roger Taylor and John Deacon were working on. May then decided to use the sequence, and both he and Freddie Mercury decided the theme of the lyrics and wrote the first verse together. From then on May finished the lyrics, did the vocal melody and wrote the bridge.\n\nThe song chronicles the effort of Freddie Mercury continuing to perform despite approaching the end of his life. The title is derived from the phrase \"the show must go on\", and may be in reaction to the numerous press speculations about lead singer Mercury's critically declining health since the late 1980s. Much of the lyrics and imagery of the song can also be construed to be a reflection on life and imminent death. It is regarded as one of Queen's most emotive, powerful songs by many fans.\n\nBrian May remembers that Freddie could hardly walk when the band recorded the song in 1990. \"I said, 'Fred, I don't know if this is going to be possible to sing,' \" May says. \"And he went, 'I'll fucking do it, darling' \u2014 vodka down \u2014 and went in and killed it, completely lacerated that vocal.\"\n\nIt was released as a single in the United Kingdom on October 14, 1991 in promotion for the Greatest Hits 2 Album, just six weeks before Mercury died. Following Mercury's death in November 1991, the song re-entered the British charts and spent longer in the top 75 than it did on its original release, eventually reaching a peak of 16. A live version with Elton John on vocals appeared on Queen's Greatest Hits III album.\n\nThe song was chosen as the favorite funeral song in a survey conducted in Europe.\n\nInterviews with Queen:\n\nMay discussed how the song came to be, in a 1994 interview.\n\n\"'The Show Must Go On' came from Roger and John playing the sequence, and I started to put things down. At the beginning, it was just this chord sequence, but I had this strange feeling that it could be somehow important, and I got very impassioned and went and beavered away at it. I sat down with Freddie, and we decided what the theme should be and wrote the first verse. It's a long story, that song, but I always felt it would be important because we were dealing with things that were hard to talk about at the time, but in the world of music, you could do it.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/The+Show+Must+Go+On\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It marked Queen's first released collaboration with another recording artist, and is featured on their 1982 album Hot Space. The song reached #1 on the UK Singles Chart. It was also number 31 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s.\n\nBowie had originally come to the studios in order to sing backing vocals on another Queen song, \"Cool Cat\". For whatever reason, Bowie was not satisfied with his contribution, and his vocals were removed from the track. \n\nQueen had been working on an earlier version of the song under the title \"Feel Like\" but were not yet satisfied with the result. The final version that became \"Under Pressure\" evolved from a jam session the band had with Bowie at his studio in Montreux, Switzerland, therefore it was credited as co-written by the five musicians. According to Queen bassist John Deacon (as quoted in a French magazine in 1984), however, the song's primary musical songwriter was Freddie Mercury \u2014 though all contributed to the arrangement. The earlier, embryonic version of the song without Bowie , \"Feel Like\" ,  is widely available in bootleg form.\n\nThere has been some confusion about who created the song's famous bass line. John Deacon said (in Japanese magazine Musiclife in 1982, and in the previously mentioned French magazine) that David Bowie had created it. In more recent interviews, Queen guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor have credited the bass riff to Deacon; Bowie also said on his website that the bass line was already written before he became involved. The September 2005 edition of online music magazine Stylus singled out the bass line as the best in popular music history.\n\nRoger Taylor was frequently rumored to be the song's chief writer. However, it appears that he served more as an intermediary for Mercury and Bowie (two of rock music's biggest stars at the time), being friends with both men. Taylor was involved in the production of the track and did some preliminary mixes with Bowie in New York, but Bowie was dissatisfied with these results and wanted to re-record everything (as claimed by May on a November 1982 interview for IM&RW magazine). In the end, the final mix was done with the involvement of Mercury and recording engineer Mack, \"under pressure\" from Bowie and Taylor (according to Brian May in the same 1982 interview).\n\nAlthough very much a joint project, only Queen incorporated the song into their live shows at the time. Bowie chose not to perform the song before an audience until the 1992 Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, when he and Annie Lennox sang it as a duet (backed by the surviving Queen members). However, since Mercury's death and the Outside tour in 1995, Bowie has performed the song at virtually every one of his live shows, with bassist Gail Ann Dorsey taking Mercury's vocal part.\n\n The song also appeared in setlists from A Reality Tour mounted by Bowie in 2004, when he frequently would dedicate it to Freddie Mercury. Queen + Paul Rodgers have recently performed the song as well. While Bowie was never present for a live performance of the song with Mercury, Roger Taylor instead filled for back-up vocals usually in unison with Mercury as Mercury would take over most of Bowie's parts. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Under+Pressure\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released in 1978 on the album Jazz. The song was written by Queen guitarist Brian May and was one of the few Queen songs played in an alternative guitar tuning commonly called \"drop D tuning\". The lyrics express the axiom \"Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder\", albeit done in a humorous and overtly sexual tone, and is a good-natured jab at groupies that hang onto bands and musicians. \nThe song is also considered ironic due to the ambiguous sexuality of lead singer Freddie Mercury.\n\nMay once mused, of the song's lyrical content, \"Why does everybody love the idea of having casual sex with people that they, otherwise, would not want to be with?\"\n\nVocal arrangements are quite different between the studio version and the live version. In live performances, the lead vocals during the chorus were sung by Freddie Mercury and harmonised with an upper voice (Roger Taylor) and a lower voice (Brian May). In the studio version, there is no higher harmony. The lead vocals are sung by Freddie Mercury, while Brian May sings lead on the intro and choruses.\n\nThe single version (which can be found on Greatest Hits) omits the extended guitar interludes between the verses as well as fading out before the ending.\n\n\"Fat Bottomed Girls\" was released as a Double A-side with the song \"Bicycle Race.\" This cut includes the line \"Get on your bikes and ride\". Bicycle Race also contains the line \"Fat bottomed girls, they'll be riding today, so look out for those beauties, oh yeah\", completing a double cross-reference between the two songs.\n\nThe original single cover featured a nude woman riding a bicycle. When many stores refused to stock the single because of the cover, the label altered the image so that the woman was wearing panties. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Fat+Bottomed+Girls\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released on their 1978 album Jazz and was written by Queen's front-man Freddie Mercury. The song is unusual for a Queen single in that it shows off the band's humorous side. Among other comic moments it has a middle eight which features bicycle bells. Fans would often replicate this at Queen concerts with their own such bells.\n\nMercury was inspired to write 'Bicycle Race' while Queen were in France to work on their 1978 album release (Jazz) during the annual Tour de France. \n\nTo release this song Queen staged a bicycle race with 65 naked women. The video was originally banned and subsequently re-edited with added special effects to censor the offensive imagery.\nA great backlash would follow after Queen released promotional posters featuring a woman's nude backside atop a bicycle. Queen, as always, took it in stride in their typical tongue-in-cheek fashion.\n\n\"People think we take ourselves a lot more seriously than we actually do\", Roger Taylor said in a press conference at the time. Lead singer Mercury went further and said of the poster, \"It's cheeky - naughty, but not lewd. Certain stores, you know, won't run our poster. I guess some people don't like to look at nude ladies.\"\n\nThis song was released as a double-A side with \"Fat Bottomed Girls\" and contains the line \"Fat Bottomed Girls, they'll be riding today/ so look out for those beauties, oh yeah\". For its part, \"Fat Bottomed Girls\" contains the line \"Get on your bikes and ride!\"  A crudely retouched photograph of a naked cyclist from the bicycle race was used for the single cover (now sporting a bikini bottom). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Bicycle+Race\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Queen - 'Radio Ga Ga' Click here to buy the DVD with this video at the Official Queen..."}, "description": "\"Radio Ga Ga\" is a song performed and recorded by Queen, and was written by their drummer Roger Taylor for the band's 1984 album The Works. It was released as a single with I Go Crazy, a Brian May-written track, as its original B-side (3:42).\n\nThe single was an enormous worldwide success for the band. It reached number two in the UK (kept from the number one spot only by Frankie Goes To Hollywood's smash hit \"Relax\"). In the USA it reached the number 16 spot. This was also their last Top 20 hit single in the US until 1992.\n\n\"Rado Ga Ga\" is said to be a commentary on the invention of television's overtaking radio's popularity and how one would listen to radio for a favorite comedy, drama, or sci-fi program and so on. It also pertained to the advent of the music video and MTV. (Ironically, the video would become a regular staple on MTV in 1984.)\n\nTaylor originally conceived it as \"Radio Ca-Ca\" (apparently from something his toddler son once said), a slam against radio for the decrease in variety of programming and the type of music being played. It was eventually changed to \"Radio Ga Ga\", because that sounded better, clearer, and rolled off the tongue more easily. There are rumors that the publishers objected to the original title because of the close resemblance of \"Ca-Ca\" to a common word for feces in many languages.\n\nFreddie Mercury spoke about the song in a 1984 interview.\n\n\"\"Roger had an idea of very good melodic content, and to be honest, it was called 'Radio Ca Ca' before, and initially it was to deal with the radio being too old or whatever, and I just said, 'I think you should change the lyrical content', and in fact, we went totally the other way, so, I mean, 'Radio Ga Ga' \u2013 I mean, it's good, and so, 'Radio Ca Ca'... we were actually trying to say that video is trying to take over, what's the radio going to be?\"\"\n\nThe song makes a reference to the broadcast of Orson Welles' The War of the Worlds, in the verse \"through wars of worlds/invaded by Mars\".\n\nTaylor began writing the song in Los Angeles when he locked himself in a room with a Roland Jupiter 8 and a drum machine. He thought it would fit his solo album, but when the band heard it, John Deacon wrote a bass-line and Freddie Mercury reconstructed the track, thinking it could be a big hit. Taylor then took a skiing holiday and let Mercury polish the lyrics, harmony, and arrangements of the song. Recording sessions began at Record Plant Studios and included session keyboardist Fred Mandel, who later on would work with Supertramp and Elton John. Mandel programmed the Jupiter's appeggiated synth-bass parts. The recording features prominent use of the Roland VP330+ vocoder. The bassline was produced by a Roland Jupiter 8, using the built-in arpeggiator.\n\nDavid Mallet's music video for the song features scenes from Fritz Lang's 1927 sci-fi movie Metropolis\u2014Freddie Mercury's solo song \"Love Kills\" was used in Giorgio Moroder's restored version of the film, and in exchange Queen were granted the rights to use footage from it in their \"Radio Ga Ga\" video. However, Queen had to buy performance rights to the film from the communist East German government, which was the copyright holder at the time. Critics said that the video looked like a \"Nuremberg Rally\" much to Roger Taylor's dislike. In the video there is a part where they list some of their earlier videos (such as \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Flash\", and so forth) in a photo album, illustrating the changes and the influence videos received through the years. In the video Taylor tries to turn right in the vehicle but the vehicle moves to his left, he quickly tries to correct this but the video still shows the error.\n\nIn the video, a different version of Bohemian Rhapsody was shown. It can clearly be seen that there are flames around the four members of Queen in the clip.\n\nQueen played a shorter, uptempo version of \"Radio Ga Ga\" at the Live Aid charity event in 1985 at the Old Wembley Stadium. It became a live favorite thanks largely to the audience participation potential of the clapping sequence prompted by the rhythm of the chorus (copied from the video).\n\nThe song was played for the Magic Tour a year later, including twice more at Wembley Stadium; it was recorded for the live album Live at Wembley '86 on 12 July 1986, the second night in the venue.\n\nPaul Young performed the song with Queen at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert again at Wembley Stadium on 20 April 1992.\n\nAt the \"Party at the Palace\" concert, celebrating Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee in 2002, \"Radio Ga Ga\" opened up Queen's set with Roger Taylor on vocals and Phil Collins on the drums.\n\nThis song was played on the Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour in 2005/2006 and sung by Roger Taylor and Paul Rodgers. It was recorded officially at the Hallam FM Arena in Sheffield, England, on 5 May 2005. The result, Return of the Champions, was released on CD and DVD on 19 September 2005 and 17 October 2005, respectively.\n\nIt was also played on the Rock The Cosmos Tour during the fall of 2008, this time with just Rodgers on lead vocals. The concert Live in Ukraine came as a result of this tour, yet the song is not available on the CD or DVD versions released 15 June 2009. This performance of \"Radio Ga Ga\" is only available as a digital download from iTunes.\n\nLady Gaga gets her name from this song. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Radio+Ga+Ga\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Freddie replaced lead vocalist Tim Staffell, after the latter's departure from the original trio. \n\nThere was much deliberation as to what the band's name would be. May and Taylor had settled upon the Grand Dance, derived from a C.S. Lewis Trilogy of books Out Of The Silent Planet.\n\nUltimately, the band went with Queen, a name that was entirely Freddie's. Originally Roger and, especially, Brian did not like the name, though Mercury would eventually persuade them both that it was \"right\" for the band.\n\n\"Years ago I thought up the name Queen... It's just a name, but it's very regal, and it sounds splendid. It's a strong name, very universal and immediate. It had a lot of visual potential and was open to all sorts of interpretations. I was certainly aware of the gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it. \"\n- Freddie Mercury.\n\nQueen went through several bass players before  a young electronics major by the name of John Deacon arrived on the scene in January of 1971. \n\n\"Until John, it had been exploding bass player syndrome. If they musically worked they'd look all wrong, and if they felt all right they couldn't play. - Brian May.\n\nThis quite shy guy turned up with his immaculate Rickenbacker bass and immaculate amplifier, plugged in, and as soon as he started playing we realized it was right.\" - Brian May.\n\nLater that year, the band was secured recording time at the newly built De Lane Lea studio, and used the opportunity to record several songs that would later appear on their debut album - Liar, Keep Yourself Alive, Jesus, and The Night Comes Down.  The demo reel was passed around from producer to producer with little success, until a staff member of Trident records by the name of Roy Thomas Baker was introduced to the band by fellow Trident producer John Anthony. Baker dropped in to watch the band at work and, clearly liking what he heard, recommended Queen to his superiors. \n\nIt was eventually agreed upon that the fledgling band could record at Trident studios, though after already-established artists had finished their work, such as the likes of Elton John and David Bowie. Relegated to the wee hours of the morning to record the remaining tracks of their first album, the band nonetheless stuck it out until they reached their ultimate goal of \"perfection\".\n\nQueen's self-titled debut album was released in 1973 and received little attention from the general public. They quickly followed it a year later with a second album, \"Queen II\" which also failed to generate much interest from music fans in Britain, despite the success of the album's single, Seven Seas of Rhye, which would reach #10 on the charts after the band's mimed appearance on Top of the Pops. \n\nThe band's second album was recorded with a higher budget than the first, and the band threw everything they had into recording it. Queen II was somewhat of a \"concept album\", split into \"White Side\" vs. \"Black Side\". \n\nAs was in their nature, the band pressed onward after the mediocre success of their first two albums, immersing themselves in a world-wide tour to promote Queen II. Queen played in America for the first time, as a support act for Mott the Hoople.\n\nSheer Heart Attack would be released later that year, focusing more on being accessible to listeners, than the grand and complex ideas of the previous two albums. The recording of their third album was met with some hardships, as May fell victim to a series of illnesses brought on by an infected inoculation, required for the band's rigorous touring schedule. \n\nSheer Heart Attack brought even more success for the band, with May's Now I'm Here and the song that would be the band's \"turning point\", the Mercury-penned Killer Queen, the latter of which would reach #2 on the UK charts.\n\nDuring this time, the band began developing a huge following in Japan and witnessed their popularity for themselves when they visited the country, mainly in 1975, to promote their fourth and most famous album \"A Night At The Opera\", featuring the epic \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".\n\nQueen's popularity grew steadily through the latter half of the 70s as they released hit album after hit album, reaching its peak in the mid-80s after their \"Live Aid\" appearance, and continuing into the early 90s before Mercury's untimely death on 24th November 1991. The official cause of death was bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS.\n\nOver the course of their 30 year career, the band did sound tracks for two films (\"Flash Gordon\" and \"Highlander\"), released a string of live and studio albums, and had many many fans across the world.\n\nIn 1995, 4 years after Mercury's death, the band released the album \"Made In Heaven\". This album saw the surviving band members in the studio completing or reworking unused vocals, unreleased variations of Freddie solo material (a Queen version of \"I Was Born To Love You\" for example), and tracks where Brian and Roger added lyrics to flesh out a song (\"Mother Love\"). \n\nQueen have been on indefinite hiatus since 1997, when John Deacon decided to retire.\n\n\nSeveral \"Queen + ...\" projects have been developed in the following years, a few of them mere remixes with no artistic involvement from the band. In 1999, a \"Greatest Hits III\" album was released. This featured, among others, \"Queen + Wyclef Jean\" on a rap version of \"Another One Bites the Dust\", a live version of \"Somebody to Love\" performed by George Michael, and a live version of \"The Show Must Go On\" performed live in 1997 with Elton John.\n\nBrian May and Roger Taylor have performed together as Queen on several occasions (award ceremonies, charity concerts, and the like), sharing vocals with various guest singers. They have also recorded several covers of Queen's hits with guest vocalists, including \"We Will Rock You\" (first with Five and later Britney Spears, Beyonce, John Farnham and P!nk) and \"We Are the Champions\" (with Robbie Williams).\n\nOn the 14th of May 2002 the Queen musical 'We Will Rock You'  opened in the Dominion theatre in London's 'West End'. A Musical about young people in the distant future who aren't allowed to listen to music not generated by computers. Various Queen songs are used in the story, played by a live band. This live band was supported by Brian May and Roger Taylor on the premiere evening.\n\nAt the end of 2004, May and Taylor announced that they would reunite and return to touring in 2005, with Paul Rodgers (founder and former lead singer of Free and Bad Company). Brian May's website also stated that Rodgers would be 'featured with' Queen as 'Queen + Paul Rodgers', not replacing Mercury. The retired John Deacon would not be participating.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2006 Queen + Paul Rodgers embarked on a world tour, the first leg in Europe and the second, Japan and then the US in 2006. On 15 August 2006, Brian May confirmed through his website and fan club that Queen + Paul Rodgers would begin producing their first studio album beginning in October, to be recorded at a \"secret location\". The album, titled The Cosmos Rocks, was released in Europe on 12 September 2008 and in the United States on 28 October 2008. Following the album the band again embarked on a tour through Europe, opening on Kharkiv's Freedom Square in front of 350,000 Ukrainian fans. The show in Ukraine was later released on DVD.\n\nQueen and Paul Rodgers officially split up without animosity on 12 May 2009. Rodgers did not rule out the possibility of working together again.\n\nMore information about Queen + Paul Rodgers can be found on their last.fm page.\n\nOfficial website: www.queenonline.com\n\nDiscography:\n1.- Queen (1973)\n2.- Queen II (1974)\n3.- Sheer Heart Attack (1974)\n4.- A Night at the Opera (1975)\n5.- A Day at the Races (1976)\n6.- News of the World (1977)\n7.- Jazz (1978)\n8.- The Game (1980)\n9.- Flash Gordon (1980)\n10.- Hot Space (1982)\n11.- The Works (1984)\n12.- A Kind of Magic (1986)\n13.- The Miracle (1989)\n14.- Innuendo (1991)\n15.- Made in Heaven (1995)\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Queen\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is Radiohead's most successful song worldwide, apart from Creep. The song is perhaps best recognized for its piano riff, and for its dark bass line.\n\nKarma Police, like several other songs that would make up OK Computer, was debuted live in 1996, when the band briefly supported Alanis Morissette on an American tour. A live version of Karma Police, performed with a Rhodes piano on The Late Show with David Letterman, is captured in the Radiohead documentary Meeting People Is Easy. Today the song is usually an audience singalong when performed at live concerts, often as an encore.\n\nRadiohead members used to tell one another that they would call \"the karma police\" on them if they did something wrong. The joke was incorporated as the title of the song. Thom Yorke explained the idea of the lyrics to The Independent in 2006, saying, \"It's for someone who has to work for a large company. This is a song against bosses. Fuck the middle management!\" He also said it was about those who are judgmental. The sound at the end of the song was created by Radiohead guitarist Ed O'Brien by \"feeding sound through a digital delay machine\".\n\nThe song was covered in 2003 by Christopher O'Riley on his first Radiohead tribute album True Love Waits: Christopher O'Riley Plays Radiohead. The song has also been covered by Panic at the Disco, The Dresden Dolls and Tori Amos. The song is also covered on the album Radiodread by the Easy Star All-Stars, sung by Citizen Cope.\n\n.. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Karma+Police\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was written by the band's singer, Thom Yorke, and released in the United Kingdom initially in September 1992. When it was first given limited release, however, Radio 1 found it \"too depressing\", and removed it from their playlist after airing it only twice. However, it subsequently became one of the band's biggest hits, and became their only Top 40 hit in the United States until 2008's \"Nude\", despite the success of their future albums in the country. The song re-entered the UK chart at number 37 on 8 June 2008, as a result of downloads, following the release of Radiohead's The Best Of album earlier that month.\n\nCovers\nFirst should be stated that Creep itself may be considered as a cover song, based on a famous song by sixties band The Hollies. The name of the song was The Air That I Breathe and was written by Albert Hammond and Mike Hazelwood.\n\nIn April 2008, Prince covered 'Creep' at Coachella. This version was captured on a video from a concert-goer's cell phone, and promptly uploaded to Youtube. However, it was quickly taken down at Prince's request. After finding out about the blocking, Thom Yorke was quoted as saying, \"Well, tell him to unblock it. It's our song.\"\n\nAlternative rock band Weezer covered \"Creep\" during their 2008 Hootenanny Tour with bassist Scott Shriner on lead vocals. Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo stated that the song was picked to cover because \"it's incredible what they do with four chords, over and over.\"\n\nNu metal band Korn covered \"Creep\" on their unplugged album.\n\nAnberlin covered \"Creep\" in Lost Songs.\n\nScarling covered \"Creep\" on their single of Band Aid Covers the Bullet Hole.\n\nAmanda Palmer of The Dresden Dolls commonly covers \"Creep\" in concert, but her most popular version of this is her preforming the song in a crowded bar which is available on her personal Youtube account.\n\nSentenced covered it on the special edition of their 1998 album Frozen.\n\nGerman songwriter Gunter Gabriel covered the song live in 2009 with new (German) lyrics and under the title \"ich bin ein Nichts\" (i am nothing). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Creep\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Its release marked the start of Radiohead's reputation as art rock innovators, and the album subsequently received huge acclaim. The song's structure, though unique among Radiohead material, was also responsible for most of the comparisons with 1970s progressive rock that the band subsequently earned. \n\nThis song was inspired by some events that Thom Yorke witnessed at and after a star studded awards show. The lyrics \"kicking, screaming, Gucci little piggy\" are one of the more obvious references.\n\nSinger Thom Yorke often refers to it as a \"joke\" song, though not derisively; the band continues to play it live at nearly every concert, usually toward the end of the set. The song's title refers to the depressed robot Marvin the Paranoid Android from Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\n\nParanoid Android was recorded in actress Jane Seymour's fifteenth-century mansion, a house that Yorke was convinced was haunted. Bassist Colin Greenwood said \"On 'Paranoid Android' what we were into was the idea of a DJ Shadow meets The Beatles thing.\" Thom Yorke also compared the song to The Beatles' work, saying \"it really started out as three separate songs and we didn't know what to do with them. Then we thought of 'Happiness Is a Warm Gun' \u2014 which was obviously three different bits that John Lennon put together \u2014 and said 'Why don't we try that?'\"\n\nEarly versions of the song performed in 1996 had a different structure and varying lyrics. According to members of the band, \"Paranoid Android\" originally exceeded 10 minutes. It is unknown whether this long version, also fabled to include organ solos, was ever played live. However, it was possibly played by Radiohead at the Rock Werchter Festival in Belgium in July 1996, apparently the song's first live performance.\n\nOne month later, Radiohead began a brief tour as opening band for Alanis Morissette, in which they premiered many new songs that would go on to make up OK Computer, and played \"Paranoid Android\" regularly. By this point, the song was six to eight minutes long, without extended organ solos. However, the ending differed markedly from the final version of \"Paranoid Android.\" The third section originally had the lyrics \"Hallelujah\", where the final version has \"Rain down...\", and instead of the lyrics \"God loves his children /God loves his children, yeah,\" the final line of the song was reportedly, \"God loves his children / That's why he kills 'em, yeah,\" which was part of a different third section which also included other different lyrics and was extended longer, eventually returning to the opening theme and guitar riff of the song's first section, while the released version ultimately went straight into the final guitar solo. When played live since 1997, the song is performed as on the album, lacking these elements.\n\n\nJazz pianist Brad Mehldau has performed a cover of Paranoid Android on his album \"Largo\". It is also a live performance on his 2004 \"Live in Tokyo\" disc. Tribute and Radiohead cover albums also prominently feature the song; Christopher O'Riley's Hold Me to This features a version, as do Sia Furler on Exit Music: Songs with Radio Heads and the reggae group Easy Star All-Stars on their cover album Radiodread. Los Angeles rock band Phantom Planet has also covered the song; a version of it is on their album Connect Sets, and they perform it live. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Paranoid+Android\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released as the third and final single from the group's 1997 album OK Computer. Accompanied by a music video that featured a single shot of singer Thom Yorke's head in a plastic bubble that filled with water, the single peaked at number four in the United Kingdom.\n\nRadiohead wrote \"No Surprises\" while touring with the band R.E.M. in 1995. \"No Surprises\" was the first song Radiohead recorded on the first day of recording sessions for OK Computer. The version of the song on the album is the first take recorded. Singer Thom Yorke commented, \"We did endless versions afterwards [...] and they were all just covers of the first version. So we gave up and went back to [the original].\"\n\nThe lyrics originally told the story of a man who has become fed up with the way things are working out for him and is having problems with his girlfriend. Two lines from this version are, \"He was sick of her excuses / To not take off her dress when bleedin' in the bathroom.\" Preparing to record the song, Yorke altered the lyrics dramatically; instead of telling a love story about a man and his girlfriend, the song now appears to figuratively reference taking one's own life (as evidenced in lyrics such as \"I'll take a quiet life/A handshake/Of carbon monoxide\") to illustrate contempt for the complacency of British \"normality\".\n\n\"No Surprises\" was released as the third single from OK Computer on 12 January 1998. The single reached number four on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe music video for \"No Surprises\" was directed by Grant Gee. The video consists solely of a single close-up shot of Thom Yorke's head inside a clear plastic bubble. The lyrics to the song scroll backwards on the bottom of the screen throughout the video. After the first verse, the plastic helmet begins to fill with water. Yorke continues singing as he attempts to lift his head above the rising water. Once the bubble completely fills, Yorke is motionless for over a minute, after which the water is released and he resumes singing. For Yorke's safety, the video was filmed at high-speed and played back in slow-motion.\n\nRecently \"No Surprises\" were present in House open 6th. season episode that shows Hugh Laurie's character suffering to drop the vicodin dependence. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/No+Surprises\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song's lyrics are about Canary Wharf in London and about the world of mass marketing and mass consumption. One source of frustration for the band at the time was their US record label, Capitol, who wanted a strong track for American radio to follow the success of their previous hit single, \"Creep\". Surprised that the slow paced \"Fake Plastic Trees\" was seen as a potential single to follow up \"Creep\" , Yorke ultimately realized the label had remixed the track without his approval: \"Last night I was called by the American record company insisting, well almost insisting, that we used a Bob Clearmountain mix of it. I said 'No way'. All the ghost-like keyboards sounds and weird strings were completely gutted out of his mix, like he'd gone in with a razor blade and chopped it all up.

The song was written and recorded by the band for their seventh studio album In Rainbows (2007), and was produced by Nigel Godrich. One of the band's most direct love songs, \"All I Need\" is a downbeat track which sees frontman Thom Yorke singing of obsession and unrequited love. The recording also incorporates a full string section, a synthesizer, and various other instruments into its instrumentation. Lead guitarist Jonny Greenwood utilized a string section in order to produce the desired effect of white noise produced by a band playing loudly in a room. Prior to its official release on In Rainbows, the song was debuted live by Radiohead at a Chicago, Illinois concert in June 2006.\n\nIn support of the MTV EXIT anti-human trafficking campaign, Radiohead produced a video for \"All I Need\", directed by Steve Rogers, which premiered on May 1, 2008. The clip, which contrasts the lives of two young boys\u2014an average, well-off child from a developed environment, and a sweatshop worker\u2014received critical acclaim and won numerous awards. On 5 January 2009, \"All I Need\" impacted United States adult album alternative radio as the fifth and final single from In Rainbows. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/All+I+Need\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Radiohead\u2019s album title, \u201cIn Rainbows,\u201d and this song from which it comes, suggest there are deals made, and reckonings to be made by the life we live and these deals mean we live multiple lives, not a singular or pure one. Thus, as the song, Reckoner, says, \u201cBecause we separate like/ripples on a blank shore.\u201d That is to say, we fragment and in the fragmentation make and are \u201cin rainbows.\u201d We are clothed and bathed in the colors of life. This is the exit door from the moral dilemmas that would condemn us to hell for the choices we make, the inflexible codes that demand we live an impossibly pure life. It is redemption and is similar to the redemption of Faust at the end of the story, at least in Goethe\u2019s version. Interestingly, the song preceding this one is currently called \u201cFaust Arp.\u201d This further lead to think it was intended. And Mephistopheles, shows up in, \u201cVideotape,\u201d which interestingly enough is a song about a kind of redemption. The album has the vague structure, of the Faust story. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Reckoner\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Although not included on either of the two soundtrack albums at the request of Thom Yorke, the song appears on the band's highly acclaimed third album, OK Computer (1997). The moment in the film when Claire Danes (as Juliet) holds a gun to her head was the actual inspiration for \"Exit Music\". Thom Yorke also had the 1968 adaptation of the play (Romeo and Juliet) in his head:  \"I saw the Zeffirelli version when I was 13 and I cried my eyes out, because I couldn't understand why, the morning after they shagged, they didn't just run away. The song is written for two people who should run away before all the bad stuff starts.

The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993).  Radiohead's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). The band's textured guitar parts and Yorke's falsetto singing were warmly received by critics and fans. \n\nInternational success (1996 - 2000)\nRadiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to greater international fame. Featuring an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, OK Computer has often been acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s.\n\nA change in style and leaving EMI (2000 \u2013 2003)\nKid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked a change in the band's musical style. Radiohead incorporated experimental electronic music, Krautrock, post-punk and jazz influences into their songs, dividing fans and critics, but they remained popular. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of guitar-driven rock, electronics and lyrics inspired by headlines, was the band's final album for their major record label, EMI. \n\nIndependent releases and touring (2005 - 2013)\nIn 2007, Radiohead independently released their seventh album, In Rainbows, originally as a digital download for which each customer could set their own price, later in stores, to critical and chart success.\n\nIn 2011, Radiohead released their eighth album, The King of Limbs - again independently - which was described as an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures.\n\nIn February 2012, Radiohead began The King of Limbs world tour - with concerts in the US, Canada, Mexico, Europe, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. In early 2013, following the tour, Thom Yorke released a studio album entitled Amok with his band Atoms for Peace.\n\nNinth Studio Album - \"A Moon Shaped Pool\"  (2016)\nAfter much speculation, on May 8, 2016, Radiohead released their long awaited ninth album,\"A Moon Shaped Pool\" on various streaming services. The band announced the release of their latest 11-track album on Twitter. The first track from the album was \"Burn the Witch\".\n\nGlastonbury 2017\nOn October 20, 2016, Radiohead was announced as the headline act for the opening night at Glastonbury Music Festival in June 2017. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released by Columbia Records on November 1, 1994, as the lead single from the album. The song was written by Carey and Walter Afanasieff, who also served as co-arranger and producer. As an up-tempo love song, it incorporates pop music and traditional beats. Its lyrics describe a woman's declaration that she does not care about Christmas presents or lights; all she desires for Christmas  is to spend time with her lover.\n\nAccording to the All I Want For Christmas Is You Songfacts, in December 2006 this became the first ever ringtone to achieve an RIAA gold certification for sales of over 500,000.\n\nThe song's music video was filmed during the Christmas season of 1993. It presents movie snippets of Carey decorating a Christmas tree, spending time in the snow, and performing other festive activities. Carey performed the song live during the Japanese leg of her Daydream World Tour (1996), Butterfly World Tour (1998) and Charmbracelet World Tour (2002\u20132003), as well as the Walt Disney World Christmas Day Parade in 2004, which aired on ABC. A So So Def remix version was released in 2000, and a dance mix in 2009. In 2010, Carey re-recorded the song for her thirteenth studio and second holiday album, Merry Christmas II You, titled \"All I Want for Christmas Is You (Extra Festive)\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mariah+Carey/_/All+I+Want+for+Christmas+Is+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Written and produced by Carey, Jermaine Dupri, Manuel Seal, and Johnt\u00e1 Austin, the song was inspired by 1980s R&B and soul. Its arrangement is built on simple piano chords and an understated backbeat, and its lyrics chronicle a woman's desperation for her former lover to return after their separation. Billboard magazine named it the most popular song of the 2000s and most successful song by a female artist in Billboard history.\n\nFollowing a career-decline between 2001 and 2005, Carey achieved major worldwide success with \"We Belong Together\" as the song topped the charts in Australia and the United States (for 14 non-consecutive weeks). In the U.S., the song also repeatedly broke many BDS Airplay records and was warmly received by critics. It won Carey a number of industry awards, including two Grammy Awards in 2006.Billboard magazine listed \"We Belong Together\" ninth on The Billboard: All-Time Hot 100 Top Songs  and the most successful song of the 2000s decade.\n\nAs for it's music style is a pop ballad that exhibits strong influences from hip hop and R&B. The song is propelled by a programmed Roland TR-808-styled kick and hi-hat, which is prominently utilized in hip hop music.Carey adopts a reserved, rap-flavored singing style, which garnered approval from the critics who admonish her ornate, melismatic singing style.\n\n\"We Belong Together\" became a \"career re-defining\" song for Mariah Carey at a point when many fans and critics had considered her career over.\n\nAccording to the We Belong Together Songfacts, the wedding dress that Mariah wears in the video is the same one in which she got married to Tommy Mottola in 1993. Mottola and Carey divorced in 1998, but she held onto the wedding dress, and when the video's director needed a dress, she volunteered the use of it. \n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mariah+Carey/_/We+Belong+Together\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song has been recorded by over 180 artists, and versions released as singles by Harry Nilsson (1971) and Mariah Carey (1994) became international best-sellers. Paul McCartney once described the ballad as \"...the killer song of all time.\"\n\nMariah Carey's version, based on Harry Nilsson's version rather than the Badfinger original, was released as the third single of Music Box in the first quarter of 1994, and in the United States it was released on 24 January 1994, just over a week after Nilsson had died following a heart attack on 15 January 1994. In the U.S. it was promoted as a double A-side with \"Never Forget You\". Carey said that she decided to cover the song when she heard it in a restaurant (although when performing the song in Tokyo, she said she listened to it when she was a little girl). Her version has been considered very popular on talent shows. \"Without You\" was later included on some non-U.S. pressings of her compilation album #1's (1998), and her 2001 compilation, Greatest Hits.\n\nDavid Browne of Entertainment Weekly called it a \"by-the-numbers remake of Nilsson's melodramatic 1972 hit.\" Stephen Holden of Rolling Stone called this song \"likeliest contender\" for ballads like \"I Will Always Love You\" and he praised \"Carey dips into her lower register and is accompanied by backup singers (including herself) magnified to sound like a mighty gospel chorus.\"\n\n\"Without You\" reached number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, remaining in the top 40 for 21 weeks and on the chart for 23. It reached number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay and number 3 on the Hot 100 Singles Sales. Both radio airplay and sales were strong, and it was certified gold by the RIAA. It was ranked 16 on the Hot 100 1994 year-end charts.\n\n\"Without You\" remains Carey's biggest hit across Europe. It became her first UK number 1 single, and still remains her only number 1 there as a solo artist. It debuted at number 1 on the chart and stayed at number 1 for four weeks. It was also her first chart-topper in Italy, but was most successful in Switzerland (with ten non-consecutive weeks at number 1) and the Netherlands (twelve weeks). It also topped the singles chart in Germany for four weeks and Austria for eight weeks, where Carey's success had previously been limited. It also topped the Swedish Singles Chart for eight weeks, was number 1 in Ireland for five weeks and in New Zealand for one week.

It was released to radio on June 16, 2009. The song is produced and co-written by Mariah Carey, The-Dream and Tricky Stewart.\n\nOn June 9, 2009, Carey announced via Twitter that the first single from Memoirs would be \"Obsessed\" and that it would be released to radio the following Tuesday, June 16; she also stated that \"this is one of [her] favorite songs ever.\" The singer also stated that the song was an \"uptempo fun summer record\", and even though she wanted to release a Butterfly-era ballad, \"Obsessed\" had to come out first. She wrote on Twitter, \"It's different for me, but clearly, it's SO me!\"\n\n\"Obsessed\" premiered on June 16, 2009 on Chicago\u2019s B96. A remix of the song featuring rapper Gucci Mane was premiered on the same day. The music video will be directed by Brett Ratner.\n\nThe song's opening line is a quote from Mean Girls, one of Carey's favourite films.\n\nIn an interview with HipHopDX, The-Dream stated that Carey had a song that everyone would be talking about and that it would \"light up the blogs\", also calling it a \"fire record\"; he also stated that \"somebody\u2019s going to be very upset\".\n\nWithin hours after the song's release, various outlets speculated that its target was rapper Eminem, in response to his song \"bagpipes from baghdad\", in which he taunted Carey's husband, Nick Cannon. According to MTV, Carey alludes to drug problems in \"Obsessed\", which Eminem opened up about on his latest album, relapse. The-Dream confirmed that the song is directed at someone, but refused to reveal who.\n\nAccording to the Obsessed Songfacts, rather than being an Eminem diss, the main inspiration for the song was the Lindsay Lohan movie Mean Girls. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mariah+Carey/_/Obsessed\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is built around a Latin guitar, Latin chord, and also makes subtle use of Latin percussion in the first chorus, before taking on a more conventional contemporary R&B-style beat. Its protagonist declares she would give \"her all\" to have just one more night with her estranged lover. It was released as the album's fifth and final single in 1998. \"My All\" at the time set a record, giving Carey her thirteenth number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, the most by any female recording artist.\n\nThe song ranks among one of Carey's most remixed tracks. The main R&B remix of this single is the So So Def remix, which features re-recorded vocals by Carey. The song's main dance remix is by David Morales. Known as the Classic Club mix, it is Carey's first collaboration with Morales for which she did not record entirely new vocals.\n\nCarey recorded a Spanish version of \"My All\", \"Mi Todo\" and it was released outside the U.S. on the \"My All\" single and the Latin American versions of Butterfly. Unlike \"Hero\" (1993) and \"Open Arms\" (1996), Carey recorded the Spanish version of the song in a different key from the original English version.\n\n\nThe single's video, shot entirely in black and white and on location in Puerto Rico, was one of the last music videos directed by fashion photographer Herb Ritts before he died. The images of Carey lying in the shell and in front of the flowers were inspired by Sandro Botticelli's painting The Birth of Venus.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mariah+Carey/_/My+All\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It uses two samples: \"Hey DJ\", originally performed by the World's Famous Supreme Team, and \"The Body Rock\" by the Treacherous Three. It was released as the first single from Butterfly in 1997 and became one of Carey's bigger hits. It was her twelfth number 1 single on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and became her third single to debut at number 1. According to the Honey Songfacts, Carey was the first act to achieve this feat.\n\nThe song is best known for its music video, which presented a more sexual and less conservative image of Carey than had been previously seen. It also marked a musical transition in her career, moving her away from pop music and further towards hip hop. \"Honey\" was nominated for the 1998 Grammy Awards for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song.\n\nThe song enjoyed several remixes, both hip hop and dance, the most notable being  \"Honey\" (So So Def mix), produced by Jermaine Dupri and \"Honey\" (Classic mix) by David Morales <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mariah+Carey/_/Honey\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

I'm back on YouTube and I'm restoring my channel Somebody requested me this song to make a video, so I made..."}, "description": "\"Bleeding Out\" is a song written and recorded by American indie rock band Imagine Dragons for their debut studio album Night Visions (2012). The song appears as the ninth track on the album. The song peaked at number 30 on the Billboard Rock Songs chart.\n\nThe song, compared to the former half of the Night Visions album, is one of Imagine Dragons' darker songs, and like most of the songs on Night Visions, it makes use of the Bass drum to set the overall tone and mood of the song. The song incorporates a jagged-edge production effect, where the guitar chords are separately recorded and mixed separately from the recording itself. When chords in the song are not repeated and flow through, the recording plays normally. However, if the chords repeat themselves, they literally repeat themselves in the recording as well to produce a broken record effect, as if the recording is skipping over itself. The song also makes use of synthesizer jabs to emphasize the belligerency of the song's atmosphere and mood. Also notable is that the lead-in unusually lasts three beats, unlike most songs where usually the lead-in would last two or a single beat before the song starts. \"Bleeding Out\" has been interpreted many ways, but with the consistent factor of sacrifice. Most agree that the song is about people giving all they have for another. They are willing to do everything in their power to protect this people, and that includes \"bleeding out for [them].\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Imagine+Dragons/_/Bleeding+Out\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band consists of Dan Reynolds (vocals), Wayne Sermon (guitar), Ben McKee (bass) and Daniel Platzman (drums). The band released four EPs - \"Imagine Dragons\" (2009), \"Hell and Silence\" (2010), \"It's Time\" (2011) and \"Continued Silence\" (2012) - before releasing their debut full length album \"Night Visions\" on 4 September 2012.\n\nThe band's single \"It's Time\", which previously appeared on the \"It's Time\" and \"Continued Silence\" EPs in addition to appearing on \"Night Visions\", is the group's biggest hit, reaching #33 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIn a dark kitchen in the middle of a sweaty night in Las Vegas, all 6\u20194\u201d of Dan Reynolds is hunched over a laptop, slapping beats on the table and crooning lyrics into a tiny microphone.  Before long, he and the other three members of indie rock band Imagine Dragons would be playing \u201cIt\u2019s Time,\u201d that same laptop-demo-turned-supersized-anthem, from the roof of a parking garage to a wave of thousands of screaming fans.  This song title to the single from their 2012 debut KidInaKorner/Interscope release \u201cContinued Silence EP\u201d is an all too apt descriptor of the band\u2019s hard-earned success\u2014but it\u2019s also emblematic of the deep-seated anxiety Reynolds and the rest of the band experienced leaving behind any realistic expectation of a normal job to do the thing they love most. \n\nA third-generation Las Vegas native, Reynolds is no stranger to the adage \u201cthe house always wins,\u201d choosing to pave his musical career with a near obsessive work ethic and hundreds of unused demos rather than roll the dice with the first songs that sprung from his mouth.  It\u2019s no surprise, then, that he was drawn to guitarist Wayne Sermon, another founding member of Imagine Dragons.  Having practically grown up in a recording studio and graduated Berklee College of Music, Wayne had been practicing his guitar through meals and other socially inappropriate situations as long as he could remember; he challenged Dan in a way that was both uncomfortable and exactly what they both needed.  When they began writing songs together and recognized something special was happening, Wayne called up his Berklee friend Ben McKee, who promptly dropped out of school with only a few credits left, moving across the country to play bass for the band.  This sort of reckless/genius behavior is typical for Ben, who has an uncanny penchant for spicy food and a suitcase full of unbelievable road stories.  More recently, the band was joined by drummer Daniel Platzman, another Bostonian schoolmate who seems way too nice to be playing rock and roll until you actually see him in action.\n\nSeveral tours and three self-released EPs later, Imagine Dragons had made a serious name for itself, particularly in the west coast circuit.  Although their songs vary from nearly whimsical and light to brooding and powerful, listeners are drawn to the inherent honesty in the music.  The only rule of thumb for the band, it seems, is to write from a true place; the result is songs that literally run the spectrum of human emotion.  Attend a concert, and it becomes clear that the live performance of deeply personal songs has a real effect on people.  And the band itself is not immune, as demonstrated when Dan literally passed out into the drum set during a finale song, sending cymbals and drum stands crashing while the rest of the band played on until the close.\n\nGreat songwriting is bound to be noticed eventually.  As proof that the harder you work, the luckier you get, one of those people who noticed was Grammy winning producer Alex da Kid (Eminem, Rihanna).  Alex and Dan began collaborating on projects, and soon the band had developed a relationship with Alex and his team.  The alchemy resulting from Alex\u2019s hip hop sensibilities and Imagine Dragons\u2019 anthemic rock is nothing short of explosive.  The byproduct of this creative collision is \u201cContinued Silence,\u201d a six song in-your-face sonic grenade that breaks musical boundaries and yet is strangely relatable by its improbably diverse audience. \n\nDespite it all, on any given day when they aren\u2019t on the road playing shows, you can still find Imagine Dragons huddled away in a rehearsal room somewhere, banging out song after song in search of the next perfect track.  Like most things in Vegas, the band is angled at going big or going bust.  For the sake of those who love great music, we hope it\u2019s the former.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Imagine+Dragons\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

She started her career as a singer in the local Adelaide acid jazz band Crisp in the mid-1990s. In 1997, when Crisp disbanded, she released her debut studio album titled OnlySee in Australia. She then moved to London, England, and provided lead vocals for the British duo Zero 7.\n\nIn 2000, Sia signed to Sony Music's sub-label Dance Pool and released her second studio album, Healing Is Difficult, the following year. Displeased with the promotion of the record, she signed to Go! Beat and released her third studio album, Colour the Small One, in 2004. The project struggled to connect with a mainstream audience, and so Sia relocated to New York City in 2005 and began touring across the United States. She released her fourth and fifth studio releases, Some People Have Real Problems and We Are Born, in 2008 and 2010, respectively. She then took a hiatus from performing, during which she focused on songwriting for other artists. Her catalogue includes the successful collaborations \"Titanium\" (with David Guetta), \"Diamonds\" (with Rihanna) and \"Wild Ones\" (with Flo Rida).\n\nIn 2014, Sia released her sixth studio album 1000 Forms of Fear, which debuted at No 1 in the U.S. Billboard 200 and generated the top-ten breakthrough single \"Chandelier\" and a trilogy of music videos starring child dancer Maddie Ziegler. In 2016, she released her seventh studio album This Is Acting, which spawned her first Hot 100 number one single, \"Cheap Thrills\". The same year, Sia gave her Nostalgic for the Present Tour, which incorporated performance art elements. Sia has received an array of accolades, including ARIA Awards and an MTV Video Music Award. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sia\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was also released as a single, and was #1 for three weeks in both the UK and USA. \"Help!\" was written primarily by John Lennon, but credited (as all Beatles song written by either person) to Lennon/McCartney. Paul McCartney reports that he had a hand in writing the song as well, being called in \"to complete it\" in a two-hour joint writing session at Lennon's house. In 2004, \"Help!\" was ranked number 29 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time.\n\nCover versions:\n- In 1968, Deep Purple recorded a cover version (greatly slowed-down) of the song on their album Shades of Deep Purple. Consistent with Lennon's other remark's about the song, he said that this version was 'the way the Beatles' should have done it'.\n- In 1970, the Carpenters did a cover version for release on their album, \"Close to You\". It was not released as a single.\n- In 1976, Henry Gross covered it for the ephemeral musical documentary All This and World War II. John Lennon once stated that this was his favourite version of the song. George and Paul do backing vocals.\n- In 1976, The Damned covered the song for the B-side of \"New Rose\".\n- In 1980, Australian vocalist John Farnham released the song as a piano-based ballad recorded at a much slower tempo.\n- In 1985, Ford Motor Company reportedly paid $100,000 for the use of the song in commercials promoting their Lincoln-Mercury product line. This was the first time a Beatles song was used for a national commercial campaign.\n- In early 1984, Tina Turner released a version of the song recorded with The Crusaders as the follow-up to her successful cover of Al Green's \"Let's Stay Together\". \"Help!\" peaked at #40 in the U.K. but went relatively unnoticed elsewhere. The following single \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" became her big comeback and \"Let's Stay Together\" and \"What's Love Got to Do With It\" were later both included on her multiplatinum selling album Private Dancer - her ballad version of \"Help!\" was however only included on the European editions of the album.\n- U2 played it often during their 1986 A Conspiracy of Hope Tour and 1987 Joshua Tree Tour at a slower tempo.\n- In 1989, the song was recorded by British girl group Bananarama alongside French & Saunders and Kathy Burke and released as the official Red Nose Day single to raise money for Comic Relief. French, Saunders and Burke were credited as Lananeeneenoonoo (a paraody of Bananarama who they had imitated in the French & Saunders television programme). This version reached #3 in the UK charts.\n- Noel Gallagher performed it at certain Oasis concerts at a slower tempo.\n- Paul McCartney also slowed it down a bit when he played it during his 1990 concert tour as part of a tribute to Lennon.\n- \"Help!\" has also been covered by The Carpenters, Michael Stanley, dc Talk, Dolly Parton, Alma Cogan, Rick Wakeman, Howie Day, McFly, Roxette and Fountains of Wayne.\n- In 1991, the Finnish metal band Waltari covered Help! on their debut album, Monk Punk.\n- In 1998 The Punkles did a Punk cover of this song on their first album.\n- In 1999, British jazz singer Claire Martin recorded a slowed-down cover on her album \"Take My Heart\" with Noel Gallagher on guitar.\n- In 2000, Tsunku and 7HOUSE covered \"Help!\" on their Beatles' cover album, \"A Hard Day's Night\".\n- In 2003 Art Paul Schlosser recorded a parody of \"Help!\" called Smelt which is on on his Words of Cheese and Other Parrot Trees CD now at Apple iTunes.\n- In 2007, Rapper, Lil' Wayne, sampled the song's chorus for his new official mixtape entitled, The Leak. The song was replaced on The Leak, however, and was instead put on various underground mixtapes.\n- French artist Louis Bertignac, previously of T\u00e9l\u00e9phone, covered the song on his 2005-2006 tour, along with another Beatles song, \"I'm Down\".\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Help%21\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was written while Harrison was away from all of these troubles.\n\nHarrison stated in The Beatles Anthology:\n\n\u201c \"Here Comes the Sun\" was written at the time when Apple was getting like school, where we had to go and be businessmen: 'Sign this' and 'sign that'. Anyway, it seems as if winter in England goes on forever, by the time spring comes you really deserve it. So one day I decided I was going to sag off Apple and I went over to Eric Clapton's house. The relief of not having to go see all those dopey accountants was wonderful, and I walked around the garden with one of Eric's acoustic guitars and wrote \"Here Comes The Sun\".\n\nHarrison sang lead vocals and played acoustic guitar and Moog synthesizer. Paul McCartney sang backing vocals and played bass guitar. Ringo Starr played drums, with all three Beatles providing handclaps. John Lennon did not contribute to the song as he was recovering from a recent car crash (he was also absent from George Harrison's \"Long, Long, Long\"). Unnamed musicians played violas, cellos, double bass, piccolos, flutes, alto flutes, and clarinets.\n\nHarrison capoed his guitar on the 7th fret, resulting the final key of A major. He also used the same technique on his 1965 song \"If I Needed Someone,\" which shares a similar melodic pattern.\n\nHarrison, McCartney and Starr recorded the rhythm track in 13 takes on 7 July 1969. Towards the end of the session Harrison spent an hour re-recording his acoustic guitar part. The following day he taped his lead vocals, and he and McCartney recorded their backing vocals twice to give a fuller sound.\n\nA harmonium and handclaps were added on 16 July. Harrison's guitar solo was overdubbed on 6 August, and the orchestral parts were added on 15 August. Here Comes The Sun was completed four days later with the addition of Harrison's Moog part.\n\nThis song was originally proposed by Carl Sagan to be part of the Voyager Golden Record sent to space in 1977. While the Beatles agreed with this, Sagan was unable to form a definite agreement with Apple Records prior to the spacecraft's launch date.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Here+Comes+the+Sun\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Available on: http://www.thebeatles.com/ Hey Jude topped the charts in Britain for two weeks and for 9 weeks in America, where it became The Beatles..."}, "description": "\"Hey Jude\" is a song by the English rock band The Beatles that was recorded in 1968. Originally titled \"Hey Jules\", the ballad was written by Paul McCartney\u2014and credited to Lennon/McCartney\u2014to comfort John Lennon's son Julian during his parents' divorce. \"Hey Jude\" begins with a verse-bridge structure based around McCartney's vocal performance and piano accompaniment; further details are added as the song progresses to distinguish sections. After the fourth verse, the song shifts to a fade-out coda that lasts for more than four minutes.\n\n\"Hey Jude\" was released in August 1968 as the first single from The Beatles' record label Apple Records. Over seven minutes in length, \"Hey Jude\" was at the time the longest single ever to top the British charts. It also spent nine weeks as number one in the United States\u2014the longest run at the top of the American charts for a Beatles single. The single has sold approximately eight million copies and is frequently included on professional lists of the all-time best songs.\n\nInspiration and composition\n\nIn 1968, John Lennon and his wife Cynthia Lennon separated due to his affair with Yoko Ono. Soon afterwards, Paul McCartney drove out to visit Cynthia and Julian, her son with Lennon. \"We'd been very good friends for millions of years and I thought it was a bit much for them suddenly to be persona non gratae and out of my life,\" McCartney said. Later, Cynthia Lennon recalled, \"I was truly surprised when, one afternoon, Paul arrived on his own. I was touched by his obvious concern for our welfare.... On the journey down he composed 'Hey Jude' in the car. I will never forget Paul's gesture of care and concern in coming to see us.\"\n\nThe song's original title was \"Hey Jules\", and it was intended to comfort Julian Lennon from the stress of his parents' divorce. McCartney said, \"I started with the idea 'Hey Jules', which was Julian, don't make it bad, take a sad song and make it better. Hey, try and deal with this terrible thing. I knew it was not going to be easy for him. I always feel sorry for kids in divorces ... I had the idea [for the song] by the time I got there. I changed it to 'Jude' because I thought that sounded a bit better.\" Julian Lennon discovered the song had been written for him almost twenty years later. He remembered being closer to McCartney than to his father: \"Paul and I used to hang about quite a bit\u2014more than Dad and I did. We had a great friendship going and there seems to be far more pictures of me and Paul playing together at that age than there are pictures of me and my dad.\"\n\nAlthough McCartney originally wrote the song for Julian Lennon, John Lennon thought it had actually been written for him:\n\n    But I always heard it as a song to me. If you think about it... Yoko's just come into the picture. He's saying. 'Hey, Jude\u2014Hey, John.' I know I'm sounding like one of those fans who reads things into it, but you can hear it as a song to me ... Subconsciously, he was saying, Go ahead, leave me. On a conscious level, he didn't want me to go ahead.\n\nOther people believed McCartney wrote the song about them, including Judith Simons, a journalist with the Daily Express. Still others, including Lennon, have speculated that McCartney's failing long-term relationship with Jane Asher when he wrote \"Hey Jude\" was an unconscious \"message to himself\". In fact, when Lennon mentioned that he thought the song was about him, McCartney denied it, and told Lennon he had written the song about himself.\n\nMcCartney changed the title to \"Hey Jude\" because the name Jude was easier to sing. Much as he did with \"Yesterday\", McCartney played the song for other musicians and friends. Ron Griffith of Badfinger, the first band to join the Beatles-owned record label Apple Records, recalled that on their first day in the studio, \"Paul walked over to the grand piano and said, 'Hey lads, have a listen', and he sat down and gave us a full concert rendition of 'Hey Jude'. We were gobsmacked.\"\n\nMusical structure\n\n\"Hey Jude\" begins with McCartney singing lead vocals and playing the piano. The patterns McCartney plays are based on three chords: F, C and B-flat (I, V and IV); the second verse adds accompaniment by guitar and a single tambourine. The main chord progression is \"flipped on its head\" for the refrain, as the C chord is replaced by E-flat. Writer Tim Riley notes, \"As Ringo offers a restrained tom-tom and cymbal fill, the piano shifts downward to add a flat seventh to the tonic chord, making the downbeat of the bridge the point of arrival ('And any time you feel the pain').\" At the end of each bridge, McCartney sings a brief phrase (\"Na-na-na na . . .\") and plays a piano fill which leads to the next verse; the phrase McCartney sings serves to \"reorient the harmony for the verse as the piano figure turns upside down into a vocal aside.\" Additional details, such as tambourine on the third verse and subtle harmonies that accompany the lead vocal, are added to sustain the interest of the listener throughout the four-verse, two-bridge song.\n\nThe verse-bridge structure of the song persists for approximately three minutes, after which the band leads into a four-minute long outro refrain. During the outro, the rest of band, backed by an orchestra that also provides backing vocals, repeat the phrase \"Na-na-na na\" followed by the words \"Hey Jude\" until the song gradually fades out. Time magazine described the outro as \"a fadeout that engagingly spoofs the fadeout as a gimmick for ending pop records.\" Riley notes the repeated chord progression of the outro (I-flat VII-IV-I) \"answers all the musical questions raised at the beginnings and ends of bridges,\" for \"The flat seventh that pose dominant turns into bridges now has an entire chord built on it.\" This three-chord refrain allows McCartney \"a bedding [. . .] to leap about on vocally\", as he ad-libs his vocal performance for the rest of the song. Riley concludes that the song \"becomes a tour of Paul's vocal range: from the graceful inviting tones of the opening verse, through the mounting excitement of the song itself, to the surging raves of the coda.\"\n\nWhile \"Hey Jude\" was intended to address Julian Lennon, writer Mark Hertsgaard noted \"many of the song's lyrics do seem directed more at a grown man on the verge of a powerful new love, especially the lines 'you have found her now go and get her' and 'you're waiting for someone to perform with.'\" Tim Riley wrote, \"If the song is about self-worth and self-consolation in the face of hardship, the vocal performance itself conveys much of the journey. He begins by singing to comfort someone else, finds himself weighing his own feelings in the process, and finally, in the repeated refrains that nurture his own approbation, he comes to believe in himself.\"\n\nRecording\n\nThe Beatles recorded 25 takes of \"Hey Jude\" at Abbey Road Studios in two nights, 29 July and 30 July 1968. These were mostly rehearsals, however, as they planned to record the master track at Trident Studios to utilise their eight-track recording machine (Abbey Road was still limited to four-tracks). One take from 29 July is available on the Anthology 3 CD. The master rhythm track was recorded on 31 July at Trident. Four takes were recorded; take one was selected. The song was completed on 1 August with additional overdubs including a 36-piece orchestra for the song's long refrain, scored by George Martin. The orchestra consisted of ten violins, three violas, three cellos, two flutes, one contra bassoon, one bassoon, two clarinets, one contra bass clarinet, four trumpets, four trombones, two horns, percussion, and two string basses. While adding backing vocals, The Beatles asked the orchestra members if they would clap their hands and sing along to the refrain in the song's coda. Most complied (for a double fee), but one declined, saying \"I'm not going to clap my hands and sing Paul McCartney's bloody song!\"\n\nRingo Starr almost missed his drum cue. He left for a toilet break\u2014unnoticed by the other Beatles\u2014and the Beatles started recording. In 1994, McCartney said, \"Ringo walked out to go to the toilet and I hadn't noticed. The toilet was only a few yards from his drum booth, but he'd gone past my back and I still thought he was in his drum booth. I started what was the actual take, and 'Hey Jude' goes on for hours before the drums come in and while I was doing it I suddenly felt Ringo tiptoeing past my back rather quickly, trying to get to his drums. And just as he got to his drums, boom boom boom, his timing was absolutely impeccable.\"\n\nDuring the recording of the master take, Lennon shouted \"Oh!\" followed by \"Fucking hell!\" at 2:56 and 2:58, respectively, into the song. This occurs after he sings \"let her into your skin\" under McCartney's \"let her under your skin.\" Sound engineer Ken Scott later told Mojo's Chris Hunt, \"I was told about it at the time but could never hear it. But once I had it pointed out I can't miss it now. I have a sneaking suspicion they knew all along, as it was a track that should have been pulled out in the mix. I would imagine it was one of those things that happened\u2014it was a mistake, they listened to it and thought, 'doesn't matter, it's fine'.\"\n\nGeorge Harrison and McCartney had a disagreement over this song. According to McCartney, during a rehearsal Harrison played an answer to every line of the vocal. This did not fit with McCartney's idea of the song's arrangement, and he vetoed it. In a 1994 interview, McCartney said, \"We were joking when we made the Anthology: I was saying: 'I realise I was a bossy git.' And George said, 'Oh no, Paul, you never did anything like that!' ... But it was essential for me and looking back on it, I think, Okay. Well, it was bossy, but it was ballsy of me, because I could have bowed to the pressure.\" Ron Richards, who worked for George Martin at both Parlophone at AIR Studios, and who discovered The Hollies, was present for many Beatle recording sessions. He said McCartney was \"oblivious to anyone else's feelings in the studio,\" and that he was driven to make the best possible record, at almost any cost.\n\nSingle release\n\n\"Hey Jude\" was released on 26 August 1968 in the United States and 30 August in the United Kingdom, backed with \"Revolution\" on the B-side of a 7\" single. The single was the debut release of the Beatles' record label Apple Records, and it was also the first Beatles single to be issued in a paper sleeve instead of a picture cover. Even though \"Hey Jude\" was recorded during the sessions for The Beatles, also known as The White Album, it was always intended as a single and not an album track. Lennon wanted \"Revolution\" to be the A-side of the single, but the other Beatles did not agree. In his 1970 interview with Rolling Stone, he said \"Hey Jude\" was worthy of an A-side, \"but we could have had both.\" Ten years later in 1980, he told Playboy he still disagreed with the decision.\n\n\"Hey Jude\" began its sixteen-week run on the British charts in 7 September 1968, claiming the top spot a week later. It only lasted two weeks on top before being knocked off by another single from Apple, Mary Hopkin's \"Those Were the Days\". The single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on 13 September; that same week NME reported that two million copies of the single had been sold. The song entered the U.S. charts on 14 September 1968, where it stayed for the next nineteen weeks. Two weeks later, \"Hey Jude\" was number one in the charts, and held that position for the following nine weeks, setting the U.S. record for the longest time spent by a Beatles single at number one, as well as being the longest-playing single to reach number one. Because of the U.S. practice of counting sales and airplay for the A- and B-sides of a single separately, at one point Record World listed \"Hey Jude\" at number one, followed by its B-side, \"Revolution\", at number two.\n\nAmerican radio stations were averse to playing anything longer than the usual three to three-and-a-half minutes, and Capitol Records pressed a shortened version of the song specifically for airplay. \"Hey Jude\" clocked in at seven minutes and eleven seconds. The only other chart-topping song worldwide in the 1960s that ran over seven minutes was Richard Harris' \"MacArthur Park\". In the UK, where \"MacArthur Park\" did not top the chart, \"Hey Jude\" remained the longest number one hit for nearly a quarter of a century, until it was surpassed in 1993 by Meat Loaf's \"I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)\", which ran seven minutes fifty-eight seconds as a single.\n\nOn 30 November 1968 NME reported that sales had reached nearly six million copies worldwide. \"Hey Jude\" became the biggest-selling debut release for a record label ever, selling an estimated eight million copies worldwide and topping the charts in eleven different countries. It remains the Beatles' most commercially successful single. \"Hey Jude\" was the top Billboard Hot 100 single for 1968, according to year-end charts. While the record was certified gold the day before it entered the U.S. charts, it took almost thirty years to be certified platinum, on 17 February 1999.\n\nCritical reception\n\nUpon the release of the \"Hey Jude\" single, Time contrasted it with its B-side \"Revolution\". Time wrote, \"The other side of the new disk urges activism of a different sort\" as McCartney \"liltingly exhorts a friend to overcome his fears and commit himself in love.\" Music analyst Alan Pollack praised \"Hey Jude\" saying, \"it's such a good illustration of two compositional lessons\u2014how to fill a large canvas with simple means, and how to use diverse elements such as harmony, bassline, and orchestration to articulate form and contrast.\" He also said it is unusual for a long song because it uses a \"binary form that combines a fully developed, hymn-like song together with an extended, mantra-like jam on a simple chord progression.\" Pollack described the song's long outro and fadeout as \"an astonishingly transcendental effect,\" while Unterberger observed, \"What could have very easily been boring is instead hypnotic\".\n\n\"Hey Jude\" was nominated for the Grammy Awards of 1969 in the Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal categories, but failed to win any of them. It did win the 1968 Ivor Novello Award for \"A-Side With the Highest Sales\". In the NME 1968 Readers' Poll, \"Hey Jude\" was named the best single of the year. In 2001, \"Hey Jude\" was inducted into the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2004, it was ranked number 8 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time. It came in third on Channel 4's list of 100 Greatest Singles. The Amusement & Music Operators Association ranked \"Hey Jude\" the 11th-best jukebox single of all time.\n\nPromotional film\n\nThe Beatles hired Michael Lindsay-Hogg to shoot the \"Hey Jude\" promotional film. Hogg had previously directed a \"promo\" film for \"Paperback Writer.\" They settled on the idea of filming with a live\u2014albeit controlled\u2014audience. Hogg shot the promotional film for The Frost Programme, with McCartney himself designing the set. Tony Bramwell, a friend of the Beatles, later described the set as \"the piano, there; drums, there; and orchestra in two tiers at the back.\" The eventual final film was a combination of two different takes, and first aired on 8 September 1968 with David Frost introducing the Beatles as \"the greatest tea-room orchestra in the world\". The film was later broadcast for the United States on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour on 6 October 1968. Footage of the performance can be seen in the Anthology DVD series. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Hey+Jude\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was first performed by The Beatles on Our World, the first live global television link. Watched by 400 million in 26 countries, the programme was broadcast via satellite on June 25, 1967. The BBC had commissioned the Beatles to write a song for the UK's contribution. Rolling Stone magazine ranked it at #362 in their 500 greatest songs of all time. \nAsked to come up with a song containing a simple message to be understood by all nationalities, Lennon's \"All You Need Is Love\" extended the message he first tried in \"The Word\", from The Beatles' 1965 album Rubber Soul. \"It was an inspired song and they really wanted to give the world a message,\" said Brian Epstein. \"The nice thing about it is that it cannot be misinterpreted. It is a clear message saying that love is everything.\" According to journalist Jade Wright, \"Lennon was fascinated by the power of slogans to unite people and never afraid to create art out of propaganda. When asked in 1971 whether songs like Give Peace a Chance and Power to the People were propaganda songs, he answered: 'Sure. So was All You Need Is Love. I'm a revolutionary artist. My art is dedicated to change.'\"\n\nAccording to the All You Need Is Love Songfacts, musically, this song is very unusual. The chorus is only one note, and the song is in a rare 7/4 tempo.\n\nThe Beatles decided the song should be their next single the day before the Our World broadcast. Released in the UK on July 7, it went straight to No. 1 and remained there for three weeks. It was similarly successful in the US, reaching No. 1 for a week (appearing on the American LP version of Magical Mystery Tour in November).\n\nIt was the last song both recorded and released by the band before the death of the band's manager, Brian Epstein, on 27 August 1967, little more than a month after the song was released.\n\nThe interviews on The Beatles Anthology documentary series reveal that Paul McCartney and George Harrison were unsure whether the song was written for Our World. However, George Martin and Ringo Starr assert it was. When asked, McCartney replied:\n\n    \"I don't think it was written specially for it. But it was one of the songs we had. [...] It was certainly tailored to it once we had it. But I've got a feeling it was just one of John's songs that was coming there. We went down to Olympic Studios in Barnes and recorded it and then it became the song they said, 'Ah. This is the one we should use.' I don't actually think it was written for it. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/All+You+Need+Is+Love\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was featured on the album Abbey Road, and was also the first song written by George Harrison to appear on the A-side of a Beatles single. It was one of the first Beatles singles to contain tracks already available on a long playing (LP) album, with both \"Something\" and \"Come Together\" having appeared on Abbey Road. \"Something\" was the only Harrison composition to top the American charts while he was in The Beatles.\n\nJohn Lennon and Paul McCartney\u2014the two principal songwriting members of the band\u2014both praised \"Something\" as among the best songs Harrison had written. As well as critical acclaim, the single achieved commercial success, topping the Billboard charts in the United States, and entering the top 10 in the United Kingdom. The song's success continued after the breakup of The Beatles, when it was covered by over 150 artists including Elvis Presley, Shirley Bassey, Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, James Brown, Julio Iglesias, Smokey Robinson and Joe Cocker becoming the second-most covered Beatles song after \"Yesterday\".\n\nWriting\nDuring the 1968 recording sessions for The Beatles (also referred to as the White Album), Harrison began working on a song that eventually became known as \"Something\". The song's first lyrics (\"Something in the way she moves/Attracts me like no other lover\") were adapted from an unrelated song by fellow Apple artist James Taylorcalled \"Something In The Way She Moves\" and used as filler while the melody was being developed.\n\nHarrison later said that \"I had a break while Paul was doing some overdubbing so I went into an empty studio and began to write. That's really all there is to it, except the middle took some time to sort out. It didn't go on the White Album because we'd already finished all the tracks.\"A demo recording of the song by Harrison from this period appears on the Beatles Anthology 3 collection, released in 1996.\n\nMany believe that Harrison's inspiration for \"Something\" was his wife at the time, Pattie Boyd. Boyd also claimed that inspiration in her 2007 autobiography, Wonderful Tonight, where she wrote: \"He told me, in a matter-of-fact way, that he had written it for me.\"\n\nHowever, Harrison has cited other sources of inspiration to the contrary. In a 1996 interview he responded to the question of whether the song was about Pattie: \"Well no, I didn't [write it about her]. I just wrote it, and then somebody put together a video. And what they did was they went out and got some footage of me and Pattie, Paul and Linda, Ringo and Maureen, it was at that time, and John and Yoko and they just made up a little video to go with it. So then, everybody presumed I wrote it about Pattie, but actually, when I wrote it, I was thinking of Ray Charles.\"\n\nThe original intention had been for Harrison to offer the song to Jackie Lomax, as had been done with the previous Harrison composition, \"Sour Milk Sea.\" When this fell through, the song was given to Joe Cocker (who had previously covered The Beatles' \"With a Little Help from My Friends\"); his version came out two months before that of The Beatles. During the Get Back recording sessions for what eventually became Let It Be, Harrison considered using \"Something,\" but eventually decided against it due to his fear that insufficient care would be taken in its recording; his earlier suggestion of \"Old Brown Shoe\" had not gone down well with the band.It was only during the recording sessions for Abbey Road that The Beatles began seriously working on \"Something.\"\n\n\nProduction notes\n\n\"Something\" was recorded during the Abbey Road sessions. It took 52 takes in two main periods, the first session involved a demo take on Harrison's 26th birthday, 25 February 1969, followed by 13 backing track takes on 16 April. The second main session took 39 takes and started on 2 May 1969 when the main parts of the song were laid down in 36 takes, finishing on 15 August 1969 after several days of recording overdubs.\n\nThe original draft that the Beatles used lasted eight minutes, with John Lennon on the piano towards the end (which was recorded later as Lennon was not present during the first few sessions). The middle also contained a small counter-melody section in the draft. Both the counter-melody and Lennon's piano piece were cut from the final version. Still, Lennon's piano was not erased totally. Some bits can be heard in the middle eight, in particular the line played downwards the C major scale, i.e. the connection passage to Harrison's guitar solo. The erased parts of Lennon's piano section later became the basis for Lennon's song \"Remember.\"\n\nStructure and lyrics\nThe lead vocalist for \"Something\" was George Harrison. The song runs at a speed of about sixty-six beats per minute and is in common time throughout. The melody begins in the key of C major. It continues in this key throughout the intro and the first two verses, until the eight-measure-long bridge, which is in the key of A major. After the bridge, the melody returns to C Major for the guitar solo, the third verse, and the outro. Although The Beatles had initially attempted an edgier acoustic version of the song, this was dropped along with the counter-melody. A demo of the acoustic version with the counter-melody included was later released as part of Anthology 3. On the final release, the counter-melody was replaced by an instrumental break, and the song was given a softer tone with the introduction of a string arrangement by George Martin, The Beatles' producer.\n\nThe theme of the song is considered to be about doubt and uncertainty. One reviewer described it as \"an unabashedly straightforward and sentimental love song\" at a time \"when most of the Beatles' songs were dealing with non-romantic topics or presenting cryptic and allusive lyrics even when they were writing about love\".\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Something\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\n\nMany people thought this was about drugs, since the letters \"LSD\" are prominent in the title, and John Lennon, who wrote it, was known to have taken acid. In 1971 Lennon told Rolling Stone that he swore that he had no idea that the song's initials spelled L.S.D. He added: \"I didn't even see it on the label. I didn't look at the initials. I don't look\u2014 I mean I never play things backwards. I listened to it as I made it. It's like there will be things on this one, if you fiddle about with it. I don't know what they are. Every time after that though I would look at the titles to see what it said, and usually they never said anything.\"\n\nPaul McCartney recounted trading lyric ideas with Lennon in an interview, saying, \"We never noticed the LSD initial until it was pointed out later, by which point people didn't believe us.\" This is confirmed by a 1971 interview of Lennon, where he described searching for acronyms in other song titles only to find \"they didn't spell out anything.\" In an interview with Playboy, published in 1981, Lennon revealed the true background of the song: \"My son Julian came in one day with a picture he painted about a school friend of his named Lucy. He had sketched in some stars in the sky and called it 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,' Simple.\" George Martin also denied the song was about LSD in the book The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions by Mark Lewisohn.\n\nHowever, Lewisohn goes on to say \"there can be little doubt that this was the very substance that provoked such colourful word imagery to flow out of Lennon's head and onto paper.\" McCartney agrees in a 2004 interview, where he noted that Julian's painting had inspired the song, but that it was \"pretty obvious\" that the song was also inspired by LSD. For his part, Lennon attributed the colourful prose not to the drug, but to the writings of Carroll. George Martin also accredits the influence of Carroll and Dylan Thomas on Lennon.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Lucy+in+the+Sky+with+Diamonds\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Eric Clapton, who was a good friend of George's, played lead guitar on the album version of the song with a Gibson Les Paul guitar. On The Concert for Bangladesh, he performed it on a Gibson Super 400 hollowbody guitar, and later acknowledged that a solid-body guitar would have been more appropriate.\nAccording to Harrison, inspiration for the song came from reading the I Ching, which, as he put it, \"seemed to me to be based on the Eastern concept that everything is relative to everything else, as opposed to the Western view that things are merely coincidental.\"\nTaking this idea of relativism to his parents' home in the North of England, Harrison committed to write a song based on the first words he saw upon opening a random book. Those first words were \"gently weeps\", and he immediately began the song.\nThe song was ranked #135 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time.\nThe song was also ranked #7 on \"Rolling Stone\"'s list of the 100 greatest guitar songs of all time.\n\nGeorge Harrison \u2013 double-tracked vocal, backing vocal, guitar, Hammond organ \nJohn Lennon \u2013 guitar \nPaul McCartney \u2013 backing vocal, piano, organ, 6-string bass \nRingo Starr \u2013 drums, tambourine \nEric Clapton \u2013 lead guitar \n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/While+My+Guitar+Gently+Weeps\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Bootleg Beatles Formed from the West End cast of the Broadway musical \u201cBeatlemania\u201d, The Bootleg Beatles\u2019 career began at a now long forgotten student\u2019s bash in Tiverton, Devon, UK on March 26th 1980. After joining the late Brian Epstein\u2019s NEMS agency, the new band\u2019s calendar slowly filled with a mix of all-night college balls and tough tours of the Working Men\u2019s Clubs of the North of England and Scotland \u2013 The Bootleg\u2019s Hamburg and in 1982, the\u00a0BBs were offered a six-week tour of The U.S.S.R., becoming the first western rock group ever to tour the Soviet Union.\u00a0The world beckoned the group as they toured India, The Middle East, The Far East (playing to 18,000 fans at the Areneta Coliseum, Philippines) and in 1984, to the USA (leaving London on Pan Am flight 01A on the 7th February \u2013 exactly twenty years to the day after The Fab Four). Ten years after the last curtain had fallen on \u2018Beatlemania\u2019 and the Bootlegs hatched a\u00a0master plan: to recreate, city by city, the Fab Four\u2019s final British tour (\u201965).\u00a0However, theatre bosses and promoters didn\u2019t warm to the concept, so the band took destiny into their own hands booking the nine-date tour themselves and the annual event, that has become The Bootleg Beatles Christmas Tour, was established. Within three years the tour had become 40 dates strong, including regular sell out performances at the London Palladium, The Liverpool Empire and The Albert Hall \u2013 venues The Beatles themselves had graced 30 years before. Having seen the Bootlegs\u2019 storming set at the \u201994 Glastonbury Festival, Brit Pop band Oasis caught the BBs\u2019 show again that Christmas at Southampton\u2019s Guildhall. Noel\u00a0and Liam were so enamoured with the group that they asked them to be the support act for their record-breaking 1995 Earl\u2019s Court shows \u2013 culminating with both bands sharing the stage for \u2018I Am The Walrus\u2019 \u2013 and then the following summer joining Oasis\u00a0again for their massive outdoor events in Loch Lomond, Cork and Knebworth. Since becoming regulars on the festival circuit, The Bootlegs have played Wembley with Rod Stewart and Elton John, shared the bill with The Corrs, David Bowie and Iggy Pop and filled Tokyo\u2019s Budokan Hall in their own right. Over the years The Bootleg Beatles have performed in front of many thousands of people including such notable luminaries as Sir Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Sir\u00a0George Martin and Her Majesty, The Queen. Of all the venues they have played perhaps none (aside from Buckingham Palace!) was more auspicious than their appearance on the rooftop of the Apple Building at 3, Savile Row, London. On the freezing morning of 30th January 1999 the BBs performance commemorated the Fab Four\u2019s\u00a0farewell gig exactly 30 years ago to the day, the event transmitted on news channels across the globe. Now into their 36th year The BBs have set the standard for all those hundreds of \u2018tribute bands\u2019 who have followed in their footsteps as they continue to keep the spirit and magic of the greatest pop group the world has ever seen well and truly alive!

They are frequently cited as the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed band in modern history, with innovative music, a cultural impact that helped define the 1960s and an enormous influence on music that is still felt today. Currently, The Beatles are one of the two musical acts to sell more than 1 billion records, with only Elvis Presley having been able to achieve the same feat.\n     \nAfter conquering Europe, with successful tours to Germany and Sweden, the Beatles led the mid-1960s musical 'British Invasion' into the United States. Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s rock and roll and homegrown skiffle, the group explored a great variety of musical styles including Psychedelic Rock, Experimental, Ballads, Western and Indian Classical among others. Their clothes, hairstyles, and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. \n     \nEarly on, the band consisted of George Harrison, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Stuart Sutcliffe, and Pete Best. The band got its first major break playing in Hamburg, Germany, at some rather seedy nightclubs, beginning in 1960. While in Germany, they also met Klaus Voormann, who would later design the cover of the group's 1966 album Revolver. Sutcliffe remained in Germany when the others returned to England and became engaged to fellow artist Astrid Kirchherr, only to die a few years later of a brain hemorrhage. \n\nIn 1961, Brian Epstein heard their sound and was thrilled enough to sign on as their manager, even though he had no previous experience in that field. After Decca Records rejected the band with the famous comment \"guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein\", his efforts eventually led, in 1962, to an audition with EMI producer George Martin, who signed them to EMI's Parlaphone label. \n\nLater, due in part to Martin's refusal to use him on recordings, Pete Best was replaced by Ringo Starr, the drummer from another big Liverpool band known as Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. Ringo was supposed to play on their first single, \"Love Me Do\", but George Martin had Andy White, a session drummer, play instead (Ringo can be heard on the album version of the song).\n     \nIn 1963, The Beatles initiated a craze known as \"Beatlemania\" in the UK with the song \"Please Please Me\". Their first album of the same title was recorded in just one day. This fame spread internationally and, in February of 1964, they arrived in the United States. Their first appearance in the States was on the Ed Sullivan Show, following \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" going #1 in the States. With this success, the Beatles released two feature length films within the space of two years: A Hard Day's Night and Help!. The songs from both films were penned by Lennon and McCartney, and albums followed their release. In Help!, the Beatles were given greater creative freedom, deciding for example to head to the exotic location of the Bahamas simply to shoot one scene.  \n     \nThe Beatles were comprised of four members in the long run: John Lennon (vocals, rhythm guitar, piano), Paul McCartney (vocals, bass guitar, piano, guitar), George Harrison (lead guitar, vocals), and Ringo Starr (percussion, vocals). Lennon and McCartney were the main songwriters and singers, although songs penned by George started showing up more frequently on later albums. Ringo traditionally sang one song on each record. George Martin produced most of the Beatles' records, and was a highly influential part of the band's sound on most of their records. He also played the renowned solo on \"In My Life\" (Rubber Soul). \n     \nFor years, The Beatles showed an amazing talent for writing hit after hit. In 1966, they ceased performing in concert (apparently they grew weary of the constant screaming from the fans, which always got so loud they could never hear themselves play; another contributing factor was the extraordinary lengths they had to go to for security reasons before and after each performance) and began exploring new sounds in the studio. This is especially apparent in albums such as Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and The Beatles, sometimes known as \"The White Album\". The White Album  is considered the band's most experimental. The novel sounds featured are due to the growing presence of Yoko Ono (Lennon's wife), as demonstrated by the song \"Revolution 9\", and the band's increasing use of drugs. The song \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" (from Sgt. Pepper's) was rumored to be an ode to LSD, although the band vehemently denied any link; they instead insisted that it described a drawing made by John Lennon's son, Julian Lennon. After the death of Brian Epstein, the Beatles began to unravel at the seams. The Beatles officially split at the dawn of 1970; Lennon had unofficially quit the previous year and the band had maintained the front of being together to protect their business interests. McCartney, who was the first to announce that he had officially \"quit\" the band and that they no longer existed, was often blamed for the band's ending although by the end he was the only one willing to carry on and was, by stating the group no longer existed, admitting to the facts.  \n     \nThe Beatles never reunited properly in the 1970s as they never fully recovered from the acrimony associated with their breakup. They did, however, make two new records in 1994, despite Lennon's 1980 death, for the Anthology project. \"Free as a Bird\" and \"Real Love\" were based on demo tapes made by Lennon and sent to McCartney by his widow Yoko Ono. They charted in the UK at #2 and #4 respectively.\n  \nThe Beatles also created some of the first music videos, having filmed promotional films in 1965 for broadcasters to show across the US and Europe rather than have to appear live. Their 1967 film promos for \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and \"Penny Lane\" have even more similarity to modern music videos, with each one created for just the individual song, and without the appearance of being a recording of a live performance. \n\nThe Beatles were also the source of a number of controversies and conspiracy theories. John Lennon was quoted in 1966 as saying the Beatles were \"more popular than Jesus Christ\", causing protests in many parts of the USA; although he publicly apologized for the statement, he also later claimed it was a contributing factor in the Beatles ending touring. \n\nA widespread urban legend that started in 1969 claimed that Paul McCartney was dead and had been replaced by a lookalike. The rumor was referred to by members of the Beatles a number of times, including John Lennon's song \"How Do You Sleep?\".\n   \nGeorge Harrison passed away in 2001. His death was marked by a large concert event in the Albert Hall. The Concert for George took place a year to the day of George's death. Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney continue to make music. Ringo released Choose Love and Paul released Chaos and Creation in the Backyard both in 2005. Paul's latest release is 2007's Memory Almost Full. Also in 2008 Ringo released Liverpool 8.\n\nGeorge Harrison once said \u201cThe Beatles will exist without us.\u201d Deftly short and simple, this quote surmises their legacy, showing how The Beatles as an entity transcends not only the music or entertainment industry, but even the members themselves. \n     \nIn 2006, a collaboration between Apple Corps, and Cirque du Soleil, culminated in a show called Love, showing only in Las Vegas. Starr, McCartney, Ono and Harrison's widow, Olivia, all were involved in the production. The accompanying album is composed of new takes on original Beatles recordings, spliced together and creating new feels for several of their songs. The project was put together by renowned Beatles producer George Martin and his son Giles.  \n     \nThe tracks in \"Love\" contain parts from original Beatles demo recordings, and George Martin created a new orchestral arrangement for an acoustic demo version of Harrison's \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\". \n\nIn October 2007, Across the Universe, a musical film which incorporated Beatles songs into its narrative, was released in cinemas to mixed reviews. The film incorporates, and indeed appears to be built around, various songs throughout the Beatles' career, sung by the principles. Songs such as \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" and \"Dear Prudence\" actually tell the story at hand, while songs such as \"Let it Be\" and \"Across the Universe\" seem instead to provide a background or atmosphere around which the story is built. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was released as the album's fourth single on September 7, 2007 worldwide. \"Don't Stop the Music\" is a dance-pop and techno song that features various rhythmic devices used mainly in hip hop music. The song samples the line, \"Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa\" which is taken from Jackson's 1983 single \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\". For using the line, both Rihanna and Jackson faced a lawsuit from the Cameroonian musician Manu Dibango, who claimed that the hook originates from his 1972 song \"Soul Makossa\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Don%27t+Stop+the+Music\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is written by Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Ester Dean, Makeba Riddick, Rob Swire and Rihanna herself and produced by Stargate. It is co-produced by Rob Swire. The single has reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, making \"Rude Boy\" her first No. 1 hit from Rated R, her 6th as a recording artist & 5th as a solo artist as of March 2010.\n\n\" When we wrote the song it was kind of a free-style. But I liked the West (Indies) influence that the music had. I just went in the booth and they were already jotting down some ideas and that (the hook) came to me. The hook \"rude boy\" was just supposed to be the intro. But it was so catchy we that we just made it the hook. \"\n\nRihanna has also told Q magazine the song is \"about the kind of street, bad boy that girls sometimes like.\"\n\nThe video was directed by music video director Melina Matsoukas in January 2010 in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California and was shot in a greenscreen. Matsoukas previously directed Rihanna's \"Hard\" music video. Rihanna said that the video is completely different from any other video she's shot before, describing it as \"pretty freakin' cool\". She added: \"A lot of my videos are really dark and edgy and tough. 'Rude Boy' is more playing along the lines from my roots. We used a lot of color, but also the costumes were very Jamaican dance-hall queen type\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Rude+Boy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was produced by Brian Kennedy with background vocals by Chris Brown and Andre Merritt. Contrary to popular belief, Rihanna uses an Auto-Tune, not a vocoder throughout the song. It was featured in a Circuit City commercial.\n\nThe song was originally written by Chris Brown and his team known as the Graffiti Artizts and was considered for the re-release of his album Exclusive. However, Brown felt that the song would be better suited for a female singer. He then forwarded the song to Rihanna. Def Jam had considered saving the track for Rihanna's next album in 2009, because she had already recorded \"Take a Bow\" for the re-release of Good Girl Gone Bad. However, Rihanna and her team felt that the song was a summer single and needed to be recorded and released as soon as possible. The decision was finally made to release the song as the follow up to \"Take a Bow\".\n\nThe song follows in the footsteps of Rihanna's \"Don't Stop the Music\" by being a fast and upbeat pop/dance-rhythmic song. However, in contrast to the upbeat music of \"Don't Stop the Music\", it is lyrically dark in tone, being about a state of mental anguish, delusional feelings and confusion.\n\nIn the UK, although not yet released as a single, \"Disturbia\" debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number forty-seven and was expected to chart higher on the 27th July due to high downloads and the release of the video, but managed to re-enter at #47 again and then climbed to #34. It also debuted at number forty-five in Ireland and then rose to #7 and became its new peak. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Disturbia\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

After she turned down several attempts by the Scottish electro wiz, she finally agreed to record this track. \n\nWe Found Love features Scottish singer-songwriter Calvin Harris it is a dance-pop and electropop song, with elements of other musical genres, including dubstep and electro house. Released in September 2011.\n\nIt reached number one in its sixth week on the BillboardHot100, giving Rihanna the record for a solo artist to have amassed twenty top-ten singles in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 in the shortest amount of time and Harris his first number-one single. With the song becoming the singer's eleventh number one single, Rihanna has become only the seventh artist in the 53 year history of the chart to amass at least eleven number one singles, as well as tying her with Whitney Houston in third place for females with the most number one singles, behind only Madonna (12) and Mariah Carey (18). The song has also peaked at 1 on both US Hot Dance Club Songs and Pop Songs charts. Elsewhere, \"We Found Love\" peaked at number one in New Zealand, Denmark, France, Canada, Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, and has attained top-five positions in Australia, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and South Korea.\n\nThe song's accompanying music video was directed by Melina Matsoukas and presents Rihanna's relationship with her boyfriend as being like a drug and how their addiction to each other results in the singer leaving her boyfriend because of his possessive nature. The video received a mixed response from critics, and they noted that the video strongly alludes to ex-boyfriend Chris Brown's assault on Rihanna.  \n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/We+Found+Love+(feat.+Calvin+Harris)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Diamonds Songfacts reports the song was premiered on September 26, 2012 during Elvis Duran and the Morning Show and was made available for digital download an hour later. On the Billboard Hot 100 chart, dated December 1, 2012, released on Thanksgiving day of 2012, \"Diamonds\" became Rihanna's twelfth number one single on the chart, tying her with Madonna and The Supremes in fifth place for artists with the most number one hits. It also tied her for second place with Madonna for female artists with the same feat. Only Mariah Carey has more, with eighteen number ones. Rihanna also became the female artist to get twelve number one hits the fastest.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not sad or dancing. You\u2019re happy and hippie. It\u2019s laid-back, but it\u2019s hopeful,\u201d Rihanna told Elvis Duran. \u201cIt gives me such a great feeling when I listen to it. The lyrics are very hopeful and positive, but it\u2019s about love and the gears are a little different from what people would expect. I\u2019m excited to surprise them sonically.\u201d\n\nAussie songwriter Sia penned the lyrics, which reference various drugs. \u201cPalms rise to the universe/ As we, moonshine and molly/ Feel the warmth, we\u2019ll never die/ We\u2019re like diamonds in the sky,\u201d sings the Bajan babe, who will launch her \u201cDiamonds World Tour\u201d in March. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Diamonds\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Her song Umbrella was one of the highest-selling songs of 2007 and her 3rd album Good Girl Gone Bad was critically acclaimed, helping propel her to superstar status. She has attained fourteen Billboard Hot 100 number ones thus far and is the second Bajan artist to win a Grammy Award. She is also a cultural ambassador for Barbados.\n\nRihanna was born in Saint Michael, Barbados to Ronald Fenty, a warehouse supervisor, and Monica Fenty, an accountant.  Her mother, a native of Guyana, is Afro-Guyanese and her father is Bajan and Irish. She is the oldest of three siblings; two younger brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty.  She began singing at around the age of seven.  Her childhood was deeply affected by her father's addiction to crack cocaine and parent's rocky marriage, which ended when she was fourteen years old.  Rihanna attended Charles F. Broome Memorial School, a primary school in Barbados, and then the Combermere School, where she formed a musical trio with two of her classmates at the age of fifteen.  In 2004 she won the Miss Combermere Beauty Pageant.  She was an army cadet in a sub-military programme that trained with the military of Barbados and Shontelle was her drill sergeant.\n\nAt the age of 15, she formed a girl group with two of her classmates.  In 2003, friends introduced Rihanna and her two bandmates to record producer Evan Rogers, who was vacationing in Barbados with his wife.  The group auditioned for Rogers, who said that \"the minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didn't exist.\"   While auditioning for Rogers, Rihanna sang Destiny's Child's cover of \"Emotion\".  Over the next year, Rihanna and her mom shuttled back and forth to Rogers home in Stamford, Connecticut. Then, shortly after turning 16, she relocated in the United States and moved in with Rogers and his wife.  Carl Sturken helped Rihanna record a four-song demo, which included the ballad \"The Last Time,\" a cover of Whitney Houston\u2019s hit \"For the Love of You\" and what would become her first hit, \"Pon de Replay\" to send to various recording companies.  It took a year to record the demos, because she was going to school and would only record during summer and Christmas school breaks. Rihanna's demo made its way to Def Jam, which invited her to audition for the label's then-president, Jay-Z, who quickly signed her.\n\nRihanna broke into the recording industry in 2005 with the release of her debut album Music of the Sun, which features the number 2 hit single \"Pon de Replay\".  Less than a year later, Rihanna released A Girl Like Me and earned her first number-one single, \"SOS, which sampled the popular 80s track \"Tainted Love\".  \"Unfaithful\" was also released and was fairly successful.\n\nRihanna released her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad, in June 2007. Prior to the release of the album, she spent the week of the Grammys writing songs for the album with Ne-Yo.  She adopted a more sexual image while recording the album, eventually dying her hair black and cutting it short. Rihanna worked with Timbaland and Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart, as well as previous musical collaborators such as Stargate, Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers to re-imagine her album compositions with uptempo dance tracks. Rihanna commented, \"I want to keep people dancing but still be soulful at the same time.  You feel different every album, and [at] this stage I feel like I want to do a lot of uptempo [songs].\"\n\nThe album topped the charts in countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Brazil, Russia and Ireland, and peaked at number two in the United States and Australia.  Unlike previous work, the album featured a more dance-pop sound instead of the dancehall, reggae and ballad styles. The album received positive reviews by critics, becoming her most critically acclaimed album at that time compared to her previous efforts.\n\nIt yielded eight hit singles - \"Umbrella\"  \"Shut Up and Drive\", \"Don't Stop The Music\" \"Hate That I Love You\" \"Rehab\" \"Disturbia\" \"Take A Bow\" \"If I Never See Your Face Again\" - all singles reaching the top twenty on the Billboard Hot 100 \u2014 including the worldwide number-one hit \"Umbrella,\" featuring Jay-Z.  \n\nIn addition to reaching number one in various countries, \"Umbrella\" was the number one single in the United Kingdom for ten consecutive weeks, making it the longest-running number-one single since Wet Wet Wet's single \"Love Is All Around\" spent fifteen weeks at the top in 1994.  The song is listed number three on the 100 Best Songs of 2007 published by Rolling Stone magazine.  In 2008, \"Umbrella\" earned Rihanna and Jay-Z a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in addition to receiving nominations for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. It managed to stay at number one in the United Kingdom for 10 weeks, the longest time spent by a female and in the 21st century, on this chart.\n\n\"Umbrella\" has also been recognised in various forms of accolades by the music press. The song is listed number three on the 100 Best Songs of 2007, published by the music magazine Rolling Stone. Time magazine also listed the song number three on their Top 10 Songs of 2007. The song is listed number one on Entertainment Weekly magazine's list of the 10 Best Singles of 2007, while topping the magazine's poll for the best single of 2007. Blender magazine awarded the song Song of the Year in their Readers' Poll 2007. The music press has considered \"Umbrella\" as 2007's Song of the Summer,  while The New York Times writer Kelefa Sanneh regarded it as \"arguably 2007's signature slow jam\".\n\nIn August 2009, Rihanna collaborated with Jay-Z and Kanye West on \"Run This Town.\" The song peaked at number two on Billboard Hot 100 and also reached the top ten in five other countries. She appeared on the cover of Vogue Italia for the September 2009 Issue.  The shoot was influenced by Rihanna's hair, which she had cut for the shoot into a mohawk-like style. The style of the shoot was Extreme Couture and very dark, and in one shot she appeared semi-nude.  Rihanna performed \"Run This Town\" along with Jay-Z and West for the \"Answer the Call\" concert at Madison Square Garden in September 2009, making it her first musical performance since the altercation with Brown. The trio also performed \"Run This Town,\" on the premiere of The Jay Leno Show on September 14, 2009.\n\nIn November of 2009, \"Rated R\" was released in the wake of a physical altercation with romantic interest Chris Brown, who pled guilty to felony assault. The album's lead single, \"Russian Roulette\" -- written with Ne-Yo - was one of the year's most controversial singles. The album also includes collaborations with Tricky, The-Dream, Stargate, and SRP.\n\nOne year later, Rihanna released her fifth studio album called \"Loud'. It's lead single, \"Only Girl (In the World)\", reached number one in more than ten countries. The song also won a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording.\n\n\"Talk That Talk\" was released one year after \"Loud\". With the song \"We Found Love\", Rihanna became the fastest solo artist in the chart's history to achieve twenty Hot 100 top-ten singles, breaking the previous record set by Madonna. The song later became her eleventh number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. \"You Da One\" became the second single from the album but was not as successful as \"We Found Love\". The third single from the album, \"Talk That Talk\" featuring Jay-Z, was announced on Rihanna's Twitter. The fourth single, \"Where Have You Been\", peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\nOn February 20, 2012, Rihanna and Chris Brown released 2 remixes, one featuring the \"Talk That Talk\" album track \"Birthday Cake\" and the other featuring Chris Brown's \"Turn Up The Music\"\n\nIn April 2012, the singer appeared in the movie \"Battleship\", which is based on the game of the same name.\n\nRihanna's seventh album, Unapologetic was released on November 19, 2012; it was preceded by the lead single Diamonds, which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 becoming Rihanna's twelfth number one single on the chart and tying her with Madonna and The Supremes for the fourth-most number ones in the chart's history.\n\nOn January 28, 2016, Rihanna released her eighth studio album Anti exclusively through streaming service Tidal. The album peaked at number one on the US Billboard 200, becoming Rihanna's second number one and eighth top ten album on the chart. The album was supported by the release of four singles including the lead single \"Work\" featuring Drake, which topped the Billboard Hot 100. Further platinum singles \"Needed Me\" and \"Love on the Brain\" both peaked inside the top ten of the Hot 100. In 2016, Rihanna was featured on several singles. The first collaboration was Calvin Harris' \"This Is What You Came For,\" which reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two in the United Kingdom. Rihanna was also featured on Drake's \"Too Good\" from his album Views and Mike Will Made It's single, \"Nothing Is Promised\". On June 27, 2016, Rihanna released \"Sledgehammer\", the lead single from the Star Trek Beyond soundtrack. On August 28, Rihanna was honored with the MTV Video Vanguard Award at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was released on 8 March 2013, as the lead single from the EP. Lorde and Joel Little co-wrote and produced the song. Musically, \"Royals\" is a minimal and art pop song. Lyrically, it expresses the protagonist's disdain for the lavish lifestyles of music stars.\n\nUpon release \"Royals\" was met with acclaim, and won the 2013 APRA Silver Scroll award, New Zealand's top songwriting prize. Critics placed the track among the year's best. \"Royals\" reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. It also reached number one in Belgium, Ireland, Canada, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand, and was certified triple platinum by Recorded Music NZ. In August 2013, Lorde became the first female solo act to top the Billboard Alternative Songs chart since Tracy Bonham in 1996. \"Royals\" was the second ever track from a New Zealander to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2013 after \"Somebody That I Used To Know\", from Kimbra in collaboration with Australian-Belgian singer Gotye.\n\nJoel Kefali directed the music videos for \"Royals\", the first portrayed ordinary teenagers doing mundane things, in slow motion \u2013 an 'international version' followed, additionally featuring short Lorde appearances. The track has been remixed by artists including Rick Ross, The Weeknd, Gilbere Forte, and Pomplamoose.\n\n\"Lately I've been waking up at 4 or 5 a.m., turning things over in my head. So much to think about, so much to break down and process and decide. I'm only at the beginning, but it has always been important to me that everything feels cool, feels right. This song means a hell of a lot to me, and to others, and I guess what I tried to do is make something you could understand. A lot of people think teenagers live in this world like 'skins' every weekend or whatever, but truth is, half the time we aren't doing anything cooler than playing with lighters, or waiting at some shitty stop. That's why this had to be real. And I'm at that particular train station every week. Those boys are my friends.

She released her first EP, The Love Club EP, in March 2013 and her first single, \"Royals\", in June 2013. Her d\u00e9but album, Pure Heroine, was released on September 27, 2013.\n\nShe was born in Auckland, New Zealand. Her father, an Irish-New Zealander, is a civil engineer, and her mother, Sonja Yelich, a Croatian-New Zealander, is a prize-winning poet. She was raised in Devonport, a suburb of Auckland.\n\nAt the age of 12, she was spotted by A&R scout Scott Maclachlan when he saw her singing in a video of a talent show at her school, Belmont Intermediate. Later, when Yelich-O'Connor was 13, Maclachlan signed her to Universal Music and, at the age of 14, she began working with their songwriters in 2012.\n\nOfficially released digitally in March 2013 and on CD in May 2013, The Love Club EP features five songs, including the number one hit \"Royals\". On May 27 2013, \"Royals\" was covered on national television on the New Zealand version of The X Factor by all-girl group Gap 5, mentored by Melanie Blatt of the All Saints. \"Royals\" d\u00e9buted as a single at number 1 on the New Zealand Top 40 on 15 March 2013 and remained in the top position for three weeks. In the U.S. it peaked at number 1 on the Hot 100 and number 1 on both the Alternative charts (making Lorde the first female artist since Tracy Bonham to reach the top) and number 1 on the Rock charts, making her the first female artist to top the charts as a lead singer.\n\nOn 8 May 2013, The Love Club EP d\u00e9buted in the number 2 position on the album chart. In August 2013, Lorde became the first woman to top the Billboard Alternative Songs chart in the United States since Tracy Bonham in 1996. Following the release of \"Royals\" in the United States in June 2013, 85,000 copies were sold during a single week in July. In a subsequent interview, Lorde stated, \"I had a sneaking suspicion that it might do all right\". In November 2013, her song \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" was included on the soundtrack of \"the movie \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\" along with tracks from Coldplay, Sia, The Weeknd, Christina Aguilera, Of Monsters and Men, and Imagine Dragons among others.\n\nThe \"Tennis Court\" single was released in New Zealand on 8 June 2013. The \"Tennis Court EP\" was released digitally in the UK on 7 June (due to the timezone difference) and physically on 22 June. It was played during the BBC Sport coverage of the 2013 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's Singles final. On 14 June 2013, Yelich-O'Connor's second single \"Tennis Court\" d\u00e9buted at number 1 on the New Zealand Top 40 singles chart.

The song\u2014which BBC Radio 2 later called \"a cross between a Broadway musical and a Salvador Dal\u00ed painting\"\u2014featured guest piano work by keyboardist Rick Wakeman. When released as a single in 1973, it reached #3 in the UK and stayed on the chart for thirteen weeks. The song re-entered the UK charts at #55 over 30 years later, largely because of its use in the original British television series Life on Mars. \nIn 1968, Bowie wrote \"Even a Fool Learns to Love\", a song with lyrics by Bowie set to the music of a 1967 French song (\"Comme d'habitude\"). Bowie's song was never released, but Paul Anka bought the rights to the original French version, and rewrote it into \"My Way,\" made famous by Frank Sinatra in a 1969 recording on his album of the same name. The success of the Anka version prompted Bowie to write \"Life on Mars?\" as a parody of Sinatra's recording.\nBBC Radio has described \"Life on Mars?\" as having \"one of the strangest lyrics ever\" consisting of a \"slew of surreal images\" like a Salvador Dal\u00ed painting. The line \"Look at those cavemen go\" is a reference to the song \"Alley Oop\", a one-off hit in 1960 for American doo-wop band The Hollywood Argyles.\nBowie, at the time of Hunky Dory's release in 1971, summed up the song as \"A sensitive young girl's reaction to the media\". In 1997 he added \"I think she finds herself disappointed with reality... that although she's living in the doldrums of reality, she's being told that there's a far greater life somewhere, and she's bitterly disappointed that she doesn't have access to it\".\nThe liner notes for Hunky Dory indicate that the song was 'inspired by Frankie'. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/_/Life+on+Mars%3F\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Produced by Bowie and Tony Visconti, it was released both as a single and as the title track of the album \"Heroes\". A product of Bowie's fertile 'Berlin' period, life in the city was crystallized into a tale of two lovers who come together in the shadow of the 'Wall of Shame' (though here \"the shame was on the other side\"). David Bowie was inspired by seeing his producer Tony Visconti (who was married at the time) kissing his mistress across from the studio which happened to be next to the Berlin Wall - the lyrics were composed as an ironic commentary on the situation, with the quotes in the title meant to emphasise the irony. While not a huge hit at the time, the song has gone on to become one of Bowie's signature tunes and is well known today for its appearance in numerous advertisements. It has been cited as Bowie's second most covered song after Rebel Rebel. The single version of this song is far shorter than the album version.\n\nAccording to the Heroes Songfacts, featured in this song are not only Brian Eno's synthesizer and Robert Fripp's guitar, but also producer Tony Visconti banging on a metal ashtray that was lying around the studio. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/_/%22Heroes%22\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It offers a promise of deliverance, that the human race has been redeemed by greater powers, with a chorus built for a crowd to sing it. It\u2019s the song that finally broke Bowie, whose performance of it on a July 1972 Top of the Pops made him a nationwide, and soon worldwide, pop star. So while the Ziggy-era Bowie is remembered today for his outrageousness, the song that made his name is warm, reassuring and most of all familiar.\n\nThe latter\u2019s key. For the average UK pop listener of 1972, David Bowie was still the weirdo who had had the song about Major Tom back in the \u201960s, and suddenly, here he was back again with another astronaut song. It finally connected. And \u201cStarman\u201d seems like a revision of \u201cSpace Oddity\u201d\u2014\u201dSpace Oddity\u201d had placed a frail human figure against the unfathomable expanse of space and cast him loose to drift into the unknown. It was submission to the void, the human race reaching its limits. In \u201cStarman\u201d the unknown is domesticated: the alien comes to visit us, in our homes, whispering through our radios, speaking softly, promising release. The stoicism of \u201cPlanet earth is blue/and there\u2019s nothing I can do\u201d is replaced by \u201che\u2019s told us not to blow it/\u2019cos he knows it\u2019s all worthwhile.\u201d The human race, or at least its children, turn out to be essential after all\u2014the earth, once again, is the center of the universe.\n\nVariations on this theme were common in the Seventies, from the popular Erich von D\u00e4niken theory that mysterious aliens had helped guide the progress of human civilization, to the benevolent star-children of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, to even Doctor Who, where in the early \u201970s the cosmos-traveling Doctor was exiled on present-day Earth and freelanced for the military.*\n\n\u201cStarman\u201d is also a pop song about pop music. Bowie\u2019s alien appears only as a voice on the radio (he\u2019s basically a cosmic DJ), whispering secrets to a teenager listening late at night\u2014it\u2019s how pop music can instantly create secret societies, break up the tedium of your life, liberate you from your parents. And \u201cStarman\u201d the track seems fused from a pile of old records. The octave-leap opening of the chorus is a lift from \u201cOver the Rainbow\u201d (so much that Bowie cheekily merged the two songs during a \u201972 concert at the Rainbow, linked to above), the guitar-keyboard hook linking the verse to the chorus is taken from the Supremes\u2019 \u201cYou Keep Me Hangin\u2019 On\u201d or The Five Americans\u2019 \u201cWestern Union\u201d (Nicholas Pegg suggests Blue Mink\u2019s \u201cMelting Pot\u201d), while the long \u201cLA-la-la-la-LA\u201d outro is pure T. Rex, particularly \u201cHot Love.\u201d It\u2019s a greatest-hits compilation in a four-minute song.\n\n\n\nFor all its familiarity, \u201cStarman\u201d begins ominously enough, opening with an eleventh chord and slowly moving through eight bars in which Bowie hums along to his acoustic guitar, all ringing open strings. This intro keeps listeners on edge, getting them to wonder just where the track\u2019s going, until a fill by Woody Woodmansey (just two toms and the snare) kicks off the verse. Bowie sings the two seven-bar verses softly, in a near-whisper in places, keeping to the middle of his range. He barbs a few vocal hooks (the four-note dips in the second and fourth bars (\u2018were low-oh-oh,\u201d \u201cdi-oh-oh-oh\u201d)), while a bar of fast acoustic strumming fills a gap.\n\nThe chorus starts with Bowie\u2019s octave leap (F to F), much like the chorus of \u201cLife On Mars,\u201d but listeners were prepared for the \u201cMars\u201d chorus via the build-up of its extravagant bridge. The \u201cStarman\u201d chorus just erupts after two bars of the \u201cHangin\u2019 On\u201d guitar-keys hook. Ronson\u2019s solo (which repeats in the long outro) is typically melodic and crafty. I\u2019ll let Jesse Gress, author of \u201c10 Things You Gotta Do to Play Like Mick Ronson,\u201d describe it: [it's] a perfect example of how to build a strong, memorable melodic line over a simple IV-I-V-I progression (Bb-F-C-F). The idea is to target the 3 of each chord on every downbeat and connect them with adjacent F major scale tones, while \u201cplaying\u201d the strategically placed rests and making the melody more guitar-y by adding bends and finger vibrato.\n\nAnd like \u201cHot Love\u201d or \u201cHey Jude,\u201d the song seems unwilling to stop, its outro extended for over a minute while Ronson throws in some additional lead playing and Bowie leads a chorus in a circle.\n\n\n\nAfter \u2018Starman,\u2019 everything changed.\n\nWoody Woodmansey, 2008.\n\nIn 1972 I\u2019d get girls on the bus saying to me, \u2018Eh la, you got a lippy on?\u2019 or \u2018Are you a boy or a girl?\u2019 Until [Bowie] turned up, it was a nightmare. All my mates at school would say, \u2018Did you see that bloke on Top of the Pops? He\u2019s a right faggot, him!\u2019 And I remember thinking \u2018you pillocks.\u2019\u2026With people like me, it helped forge an identity and a perspective on things, helped us to walk in a different way, metaphorically\u2026\n\nIan McCulloch, in David Buckley\u2019s Strange Fascination.\n\n\u201cStarman\u201d wasn\u2019t meant for Ziggy Stardust. Bowie went into the studio in early February \u201972 to cut the song as a single, but RCA\u2019s \u201ccontemporary music\u201d VP Dennis Katz loved \u201cStarman\u201d so much he mandated its inclusion on the LP (a sign that RCA\u2019s US operations were calling the shots, as American labels always had been baffled by the UK practice of keeping singles off the album). Released in April, \u201cStarman\u201d had a slow journey up the charts but thanks in part to Bowie\u2019s touring, it reached the top 10 by late June. Two television appearances by Bowie and the Spiders to support the single did the rest.\n\nThe first was Granada TV\u2019s Lift-Off With Ayshea on 15 June, but the one everyone remembers is the Top of the Pops performance, recorded on 5 July and broadcast the following day. For a generation of British teenagers, it was nothing short of the revolution, televised. Marc Riley, later of The Fall, recalled his grandmother shouting insults at the TV while Bowie performed (\u201csomething she usually saved for Labour Party broadcasts\u201d he told David Buckley). The 15-year-old Susan Ballion, soon to call herself Siouxsie Sioux, watched Bowie\u2019s Top of the Pops while in the hospital recovering from colitis; the 15-year-old Gary Numan watched it, stunned, in his East London living room; in Liverpool, the 13-year old Ian McCulloch stared at the TV and \u201cthought maybe I was Ziggy Stardust all along,\u201d as he told Marc Spitz.\n\nThe performance isn\u2019t just about Bowie, though he\u2019s striking with his copper-colored mullet, his leotard and his effortless charisma (twirling his finger at the camera while singing \u201cpicked on you-ooh-ooo\u201d, and connecting with every susceptible kid in the UK). The essential moment comes when Bowie starts to sing the first chorus and Ronson tentatively approaches the mike. Bowie notices him and sweeps his arm over Ronson\u2019s shoulder, pulls him to the mike. It\u2019s a sweet moment of inclusion, the alien embracing the rocker, and, by proxy, all of the nation\u2019s misfits. \u201cStarman\u201d left community in its wake; its promise came true.\n\n\u201cStarman\u201d was recorded on 4 February 1972 and released in April (RCA 2199) c/w \u201cSuffragette City.\u201d It hit #10. \u201cStarman\u201d wasn\u2019t a regular feature of the Ziggy tour; Bowie stopped playing it by the end of 1972 and there are some other signs (such as its odd exclusion from the greatest hits LP ChangesOneBowie) that Bowie didn\u2019t think much of it at the time. He wouldn\u2019t play \u201cStarman\u201d live again until his greatest-hits tour of 1990, though it became a standard in Bowie\u2019s early 2000s shows.\n\n* An indulgent, long footnote on Bowie and Doctor Who. Bowie\u2019s career has many parallels with the history of the UK\u2019s finest SF show (let alone the fact that Bowie\u2019s best chronicler, Nicholas Pegg, is a Dalek operator in his spare time). Bowie\u2019s recording career begins soon after the start of Who in  late 1963, and the odd psychedelia of his late \u201960s work is something akin to the whimsy of Patrick Troughton-era Who (cf. \u201cThe Laughing Gnome\u201d with \u201cThe Mind Robber\u201d). Bowie\u2019s glam era coincides with the Pertwee years (the back cover of Ziggy Stardust even has Bowie standing in a police box!) (well, no, this is a cock-up of a statement\u2014see comments), his most ambitious, influential work with the Tom Baker years (Low and the great Baker Season 14 are synchronous), Bowie\u2019s MTV-era reign with Peter Davison\u2019s. And Bowie\u2019s fall into mediocrity is matched by Who\u2018s own descent into the pit (and cancellation) in the mid- to late-\u201980s. Oddly enough, Bowie\u2019s current exile from performing and recording started just as Who was successfully revived in 2005.\n\nTop: Jon Pertwee banters with Nicholas Courtney while an engrossed Katy Manning pays them no mind (Day of the Daleks, January 1972). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/_/Starman\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A different version was recorded for US single release, featuring a funkier backing and looped backing vocals. Cited as his most-covered track, it was effectively Bowie's farewell to the glam movement that had made him a star.\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\nOriginally written for a mooted Ziggy Stardust musical in late 1973, \"Rebel Rebel\" was Bowie's last single in the glam rock style that had been his trademark. It was also his first hit since 1969 not to feature lead guitarist Mick Ronson; Bowie himself played guitar on this and almost all other tracks from Diamond Dogs, producing what NME critics Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray called \"a rocking dirty noise that owed as much to Keith Richards as it did to the departed Ronno\".\n\nThe song is notable for its gender-bending lyrics (\"You got your mother in a whirl / She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl\") as well as its distinctive riff, which rock journalist Kris Needs has described as \"a classic stick-in-the-head like the Stones' 'Satisfaction'\". Bowie himself later said, \"It's a fabulous riff! Just fabulous! When I stumbled onto it, it was 'Oh, thank you!'\"\n\nTranssexual rock artist and former Bowie associate Jayne County claims that \"Rebel Rebel\" was based in part on County's own song \"Queenage Baby\", which was recorded in January of 1974 by Bowie's Mainman Records, but not released at the time. The song later surfaced on the independent 2006 release Wayne County at the Trucks, and some critics, upon hearing the track, echoed County's claims.\n\nRelease and aftermath\n\nThe single quickly became a glam anthem, the female equivalent of Bowie's earlier hit for Mott the Hoople, \"All the Young Dudes\". It reached #5 in the UK and #64 in the USA. The latter release initially featured a different recording altogether. The single, credited to simply 'Bowie', is shorter (2:58) and more uptempo, dense and camp, featuring phased vocals and Bowie playing all of the instruments with the exception of Geoff MacCormack on congas. It was swiftly withdrawn and replaced by the UK single version, but the same arrangement was used on Bowie's North American tour in 1974, appearing on the concert album David Live.\n\nAfter retiring the song on the 1990 Sound and Vision tour, Bowie brought \"Rebel Rebel\" back for the 1999 'hours...' promotional tour. In 2003, a new version was recorded, featuring an arrangement by Mark Plati and without the reference to quaaludes present in the original. This was issued on a bonus disc that came with some versions of the Reality album the same year, and on the 30th Anniversary Edition of Diamond Dogs in 2004. Also in 2004, the track was blended in a mash-up with the Reality song \"Never Get Old\"; the result was issued as the single \"Rebel Never Gets Old\".\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/_/Rebel+Rebel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A rerecorded version was released in 1972 on the album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. Song's classic guitar solo, performed by Bowie's guitarist Mick Ronson, was ranked 85. on Guitar World's \"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\". \n\nStory: The alien messiah is revealed/created, and his destiny to save the world from the disaster in \"Five Years\" is also hinted at, as well his fate as the quintessential \"soul lover\". In terms of the plot, this is one of the most important songs as it describes the creation of Ziggy from a combination of religion, romance, sexual freedom, rebellion, and passion; he metamorphoses into the archetypal rock star.\n\nMoonage Daydream: The Life and Times of Ziggy Stardust is the title of a book written by David Bowie, published in 2002 by Genesis Publications, named after this song. The book documented the years 1972-73 and was fully illustrated with the photography of Mick Rock. David and Mick met in 1972 and formed a working relationship and lasting friendship. Subsequently, Mick Rock was allowed to become the only photographer authorised to record the 2-year career of Ziggy Stardust.\n\nThe Arnold Corns version of \"Moonage Daydream\" was released by B&C on single in the UK in April 1971. \"Hang on to Yourself\" was the B-side.\n[edit] Production credits\n\n    * Producer:\n          o David Bowie and Ken Scott\n\n    * Musicians:\n          o David Bowie: Vocals\n          o Freddi Buretti: Vocals\n          o Mark Carr Pritchard: Guitar\n          o Mick Ronson: Guitar\n          o Trevor Bolder: Bass guitar\n          o Mick \"Woody\" Woodmansey: Drums\n\nThe official band line-up, fronted by dress designer Freddi Buretti, was a total fabrication; Buretti was at the session but his contributions were simply lost alongside Bowie's.\n\nThis version was also released as a bonus track on the Rykodisc rerelease of The Man Who Sold the World album (1990).

Some commentators noted the similarities between the track and Elton John's near-simultaneous hit \"I'm Still Standing\", although both parties stated the songs were recorded at roughly the same time with no knowledge of the other, and it seems to be just a coincidence.\n\nBy the time \"Modern Love\" was issued and edited as a single, Bowie's Serious Moonlight Tour was underway. The track had become a popular encore on the tour, and Jim Yukich's video for the song used footage of Bowie and his band performing the song from the 20 July 1983 concert in Philadelphia. A live version, recorded in Montreal on July 13, was on the B-side.\n\nThe single reached #2 in the UK, and #14 in America. It would be performed throughout the Serious Moonlight Tour, and feature in Bowie's set at Live Aid, later continuing on the Glass Spider and Sound+Vision tours.

Active during six decades of popular music and frequently reinventing his music and image, Bowie is widely regarded as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s. Shortly after releasing his 25th studio album Blackstar, it was announced Bowie died on 10 January 2016, following an eighteen-month battle with cancer. At the 59th Grammy Awards on Sun, February 12, 2017, Bowie took the award for \"Best Rock Song\" for \"Blackstar\".\n\nAs a multi-instrumentalist, he was famous for playing the guitar, piano, and saxophone, but also plays the harmonica, drums, cello, marimba, bass guitar, koto, and stylophone. His first single was released in 1964, but he rose to fame with the 1969 single \"Space Oddity\" and the 1972 album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. Subsequent albums have explored blue-eyed soul, electronica, and new wave, often pre-dating these genres' popularity or even the point at which they were defined as genres.\n\t \nBowie was one of the most influential rock musicians from the 1970s to the present. He has sold an estimated 136 million albums in his career and has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In addition to his musical career, Bowie has had success as a painter, web-designer, sculptor, Broadway actor starring in The Elephant Man, and film actor starring in many films.\n \t \nBowie is also credited as being a major inspiration behind the new romantic, futurist movement, and subsequent development of electronic/electronica music.\n\t \nBowie frequently brought the worlds of high art, mime, and straight theatre to his stage acts. His most famous on-stage look was that of Ziggy Stardust; other personae include Halloween Jack, Aladdin Sane, and the Thin White Duke. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

With just\u00a0half a semester left of business school, breakout artist\u00a0DJ Vanic\u00a0did exactly that when he decided to pursue a full-time career in music. Without knowing exactly what it would lead to, the Vancouver based producer took a chance and boy did it pay off.&quot;Family and personal issues came up in my life that\u00a0made me re-evaluate my goals and direction,&quot; Vanic told\u00a0Forbes.com. &quot;I decided that I might as well spend my youth trying for something really cool and different, something I was passionate about. And music was the obvious choice, it&#39;s been one of the biggest parts of my life since I was 3 years old.&quot;\u00a0In as little as two years,\u00a0Vanic quickly made his mark. He took the festival circuit by storm and already managed to play the coveted\u00a0Coachella\u00a0music festival last year.\u00a0You&#39;re probably one of the millions of people who had his remix of Zella Day&#39;s hit single &quot;Hypnotic&quot; on repeat, which he dropped a few months ahead of his debut in the desert. Since then,\u00a0he&#39;s released originals of his own, including his latest track featuring Clara Mae &quot;Staring At the Sun,&quot;\u00a0which exudes the same high-energy as his live sets.\u00a0&quot;Clara sent over the vocal and I fell in love with it,&quot; he shared. &quot;The whole process took probably over a year though, because we kept changing the drop style and re-writing verses. As with any song I work on, it&#39;s the vocal itself that usually inspires me \u2014 whatever the singer makes me feel, I try to replicate that in the music.&quot;\u00a0\u00a0Though it appears his success happened overnight, that certainly wasn&#39;t the case. Vanic opened up\u00a0about how he&#39;s nowhere near where he wants to be skill wise and the importance of continuing to hustle.\u00a0&quot;I&#39;ve never claimed to be an amazing DJ,&quot; he humbly said. &quot;It&#39;s hard to keep creating music that is true to my own sound, but still unique and not repetitive. Though it&#39;s a challenge, I love the struggle behind it, otherwise I wouldn&#39;t be doing it.&quot;\u00a0A stepping stone that propelled his career was the moment\u00a0he signed onto Disruptor Records, the label headed by\u00a0The Chainsmokers&#39; manager, Adam Alpert. Vanic&#39;s own manager\u00a0Sebastian Barwinski (The Standard Group)\u00a0encouraged him to take that next step\u00a0and has backed Vanic\u00a0ever since he decided to make the move. &quot;\u00a0I have a really amazing team of people who help ensure everything in my life and business as Vanic falls into place,&quot; he revealed. &quot;Adam and Disruptor were the right fit. Everything they do seems to be spot on, and they&#39;re really good people to work with.&quot;\u00a0Up next, you can expect\u00a0way more new music from EDM&#39;s rising star. &quot;I have a couple remixes and a few more originals all being wrapped up,&quot; Vanic confirmed. &quot;I&#39;m hoping to release all of them throughout the summer and fall. Then I&#39;ll spend the rest of the time playing, traveling, DJ-ing, and hitting up festivals. After that we will be getting into another full headline tour across North America.&quot;\u00a0Vanic recently\u00a0played Houston&#39;s\u00a0Free Press Summer Fest\u00a0last\u00a0weekend and is scheduled to perform at\u00a0this weekend&#39;s Bonnaroo along with\u00a0Made in America later this year, where he&#39;ll be reunited with The Chainsmokers who are headlining the Philadelphia based event. However, I\u00a0have a feeling there&#39;s plenty more where that came from, this is hands down just the beginning.- FORBES\u00a0\u00a0", "title": "Vanic - Black Masquerade", "url": "http://anchorage.eventful.com/events/vanic-black-masquerade-/E0-001-110594666-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic", "country": "United States", "venue": "Williwaw", "date": "2018-03-02 21:00:00"}], "description": "Karla Camila Cabello Estrabao (born in Cuba on March 3, 1997), is a Cuban-born American singer and songwriter. \n\nCabello was a member of the American girl group, Fifth Harmony, but left the group in December 19, 2016. \n\nIn May 2017, Cabello released \"Crying in the Club\" as the lead single from her forthcoming debut solo album.

It is the third single from her second album, Fearless. In this song, she plays the innocent girl as well as her neighbour's girlfriend.\n\n\"You Belong with Me\" is a song in which the singer loves a boy, but they are just friends, and he is with someone else. Swift commented about the song's background: \"I came into the writing session with Liz Rose and said\u2026.I've got this idea. I had overheard a friend of mine talking to his girlfriend and he was completely on the defensive saying, 'No, baby...I had to get off the phone really quickly...I tried to call you right back...Of course I love you. More than anything! Baby, I\u2019m so sorry.' She was just yelling at him! I felt so bad for him at that moment. So I came up with the first line 'You\u2019re on the phone with your girlfriend, she\u2019s upset, going off about something that you said', and I ran that into the story line that I\u2019m in love with him and he should be with me instead of her. It just became this whole picture. It was really fun for us to write the line, 'She wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts, She's cheer captain, and I'm on the bleachers'\".\n\nThe music video for \"You Belong with Me\"  was shot at her brother's High School. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/You+Belong+with+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was written by Swift with the song's co-producers Max Martin and Shellback. It was released as the lead single from Swift's upcoming fourth studio album Red (2012) on August 14, 2012 by Big Machine Records. The We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together Songfacts reports that the song was Taylor's first ever #1 on the American Hot 100.\n\nAfter writing Speak Now (2010) entirely solo, she opted to collaborate with different songwriters and producers for Red. Thus, she called Max Martin and Shellback, two songwriters and producers whose work she admired fondly, to discuss a possible collaboration. The trio conceived the concept for \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" incidentally after a friend of Swift's ex-boyfriend walked into the recording studio and spoke of rumors he heard that Swift and her former flame were reuniting. With the friend gone, Martin and Shellback asked Swift to elaborate on the details of the relationship, which she described as \"break up, get back together, break up, get back together, just, ugh, the worst\". Martin then suggested that they write about the incident. Swift began playing the guitar and singing, \"We are never...\", and the song flowed rapidly afterwards. She described the process as one of the most humorous experiences she had while recording, and said the musical partners matched her expectations.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/We+Are+Never+Ever+Getting+Back+Together\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was written by Taylor Swift, Max Martin and Shellback. The song was released to the radio by Big Machine Records, LLC on November 10, 2014 as the album's second single, after \"Shake It Off\" and is the second track on the album. Musically, \"Blank Space\" is an electropop and minimal song with lyrics that satirize the media's perception of Swift and her relationships.\n\n\"Blank Space\" was a critical and commercial success, having reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 following \"Shake It Off\". Swift became the first woman in the Hot 100's 56-year history to succeed herself at the top spot. The song has also topped charts in Canada, South Africa and Australia. It was included in several critic's year-end lists and was the second and the sixth best song according to Time and Rolling Stone. In January 2015, \"Blank Space\" was ranked at number three on The Village Voice\u200a'\u200bs annual year-end Pazz & Jop critics' poll, one rank before \"Shake It Off\".\n\nThe songs accompanying music video was directed by Joseph Kahn and was shot over three days. The song received its first televised performance at the 2014 American Music Awards and as part of \"Taylor Swift's 1989 Secret Session with iHeartRadio\" on October 27, 2014 in New York City. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/Blank+Space\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song, written by Swift and produced by Nathan Chapman and Swift, was first released as a promotional single for the album on October 17, 2010, by Big Machine Records. The song was later released as an official single on March 7, 2011.\n\nThis song is rumored to be directed at blogger Bob Lefsetz, although nothing was officially confirmed. In addition, it also verses about the harsh criticism Taylor has received since her performance at the 52nd Annual Grammy awards, with Stevie Nicks, considered by many subpar.\n\nTaylor Swift also explains the story behind \"Mean\" on her official website:\n\"The song \"Mean\" is about, well, when you do what I do, which is you put yourself out there for a lot of people to say whatever they want about it, there are a million different opinions from a million different people.\n\nI get it that not everyone is going to like everything that you do, and I get that no matter what, you're going to be criticized for something. But I also get that there are different kinds of ways to criticize someone. There is constructive criticism. There's professional criticism. And then, there's just being mean. There's a line that you cross when you just start to attack everything about a person, and there's one guy who just crossed the line over and over again. Just being mean, and saying things that would ruin my day.\n\nThis happens\u2026no matter what you do, no matter how old you are, no matter what your job is, no matter what your place is in life. There's always going to be someone who's just mean to you.
